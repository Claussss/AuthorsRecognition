# Author Recognition
The program recognizes the style of different authors by using sentences as input.

Recognition is carried out by using the language model and the text classifier from FastAi library.

# Current authors in the database:

# Work example:
**Input:**

```
Puck I’ll follow you, I’ll lead you about a round,

Through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier:

Sometime a horse I’ll be, sometime a hound,

A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire;

And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,

Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.
```

**Output:**

```
Arthur Conan Doyle
```
