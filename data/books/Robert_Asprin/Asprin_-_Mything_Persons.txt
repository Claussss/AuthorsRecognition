  "Reputations are fine up to a point. After
   that they become a pain!"
  —D.JUAN
  THERE is something sinfully satisfying about doing
   something you know you aren't supposed to. This was
   roughly my frame of mind as I approached a specific
   nondescript tent at the Bazaar at Deva with my break-
   fast under my arm ... guilty, but smug.
  "Excuse me, young sahr!"
  I turned to find an elderly Deveel waving desperately
   at me as he hurried forward. Normally I would have
   avoided the encounter, as Deveels are always selling
   something and at the moment I wasn't buying, but since
   I wasn't in a hurry I decided to hear what he had to say.
  "I'm glad I caught you in time," he said, struggling
   to catch his breath. "While I don't usually meddle, you
   really don't want to go in there!"
  "Why not? I was just...."
  "Do you know who lives there?"
  "Well, actually I thought...."
  "That is the dwelling of the Great Skeeve!"

  Something about this busybody irritated me. Maybe
   it was the way he never let me finish a sentence. Any-
   way, I decided to string him along for a while."
  "The Great Skeeve?"
  "You never heard of him?" The Deveel seemed gen-
   uinely shocked. "He's probably the most powerful
   magician at the Bazaar."
  My opinion of the busybody soared to new heights,
   but the game was too much fun to abandon.
  "I've never had too much faith in magicians," I said
   with studied casualness. "I've found for the most part
   their powers are overrated."
  The oldster rolled his eyes in exasperation.
  "That may be true in most cases, but not when it
   comes to the Great Skeeve! Did you know he consorts
   with Demons and has a dragon for a familiar?"
  I favored him with a worldly smile.
  "So what? Deva is a crossroads of the dimensions.
   Dimension travelers, or Demons as you call them, are
   the norm around here. As a Deveel, your main liveli-
   hood comes from dealing with Demons. As for the
   dragon, there's a booth not eight rows from here that
   sells dragons to anyone with the price.''
  "No, no! You don't understand! Of course we all
   deal with Demons when it comes to business. The dif-
   ference is that this Skeeve is actually friends with them
   ... invites them into his home and lives with them. One
   of his permanent house guests is a Pervert, and I don't
   know of a single Deveel who would stoop that low.
   What's more, I've heard it said that he has underworld
   connections."
  The game was growing tiresome. Any points the
   Deveel had made with his tribute to the Great Skeeve
   had been lost with interest when he started commenting
   on Demons.
  MYTH-ING PERSONS            3
  "Well, thank you for your concern," I said, holding
   out my hand for a handshake. "I promise you I'll re-
   member everything you've said. What was your name
   again?"
  The Deveel grabbed my hand and began pumping it
   vigorously.
  "I am Aliman, and glad to be of assistance," he said
   with an ingratiating smile. "If you really want to show
   your gratitude, remember my name. Should you ever be
   in need of a reputable magician, I have a nephew who's
   just getting started in the business. I'm sure we could ar-
   range some discount prices for you. Tell me, what is
   your name so I can tell him who to watch for?"
  I tightened my grip slightly and gave him my widest
   smile. "Well, my friends call me Skeeve."
  "I'll be sure to tell... SKEEVE?"
  The Deveel's eyes widened, and his complexion faded
   from red to a delicate pink.
  "That's right," I said, retaining my grip on his hand.
   "Oh, and for your information Demons from Perv are
   called Pervects, not Perverts... and he's not my house
   guest, he's my partner."
  The Deveel was struggling desperately now, trying to
   free his hand.
  "Now then, how many customers have you scared
   away from my business with your tales about what a
   fearsome person I am? "
  The Deveel tore loose from my grip and vanished into
   the crowds, sounding an incoherent scream of terror as
   he went. In short, Aliman left. Right?
  I watched him go with a certain amount of mischie-
   vous satisfaction. I wasn't really angry, mind you. We
   literally had more money than we could use right now,
   so I didn't begrudge him the customers. Still, I had
   never really paused to consider how formidable our
  4               Robert Asprin
  operation must look from the outside. Viewing it now
   through a stranger's eyes, I found myself more than a
   little pleased. Considering the dubious nature of my
   beginning, we had built ourselves quite a reputation
  over the last few years.
  I had been serious when I told Aliman that I didn't
  have much faith in magicians. My own reputation was
   overrated to say the least, and if I was being billed as a
   powerful magician, it made the others of my profession
   more than a little suspect in my eyes. After several years
   of seeing the inside of the magic business, I was starting
   to wonder if any magician was really as good as people
  thought.
  I was so wrapped up in these thoughts as I entered our
  humble tent that I had completely forgotten that I was
   suppoised to be sneaking in. I was reminded almost im-
   mediately.
   The reminder came in the form of a huge man who
  loomed up to block my path. "Boss," he said in a
   squeaky little voice that was always surprising coming
   from such a huge body, "you shouldn't ought to go out
   alone like that. How many times we got to tell you...."
  "It's all right, Nunzio," I said, trying to edge around
   him. "I just ducked out to get some breakfast. Want a
  bagel?"
  Nunzio was both unconvinced and undaunted in his
  scolding.
  "How are we supposed to be your bodyguards if you
  keep sneaking off alone every chance you get? Do you
   know what Don Bruce would do to us if anything hap-
   pened to you?"
  "C'mon, Nunzio. You know how things are here at
  the Bazaar. If the Deveels see me with a bodyguard, the
   price of everything goes through the ceiling. Besides, I
   

   

   

   

   MYTH-ING PERSONS            5
  like being able to wander around on my own once in a
  while."
  "You can afford the higher prices. What you can't
   afford is to set yourself up as a target for every bozo
   who wants the rep of bagging the Great Skeeve."
  I started to argue, but my conversation with Aliman
   flashed across my mind. Nunzio was right. There were
   two sides to having a reputation. If anyone believed the
   rumors at the Bazaar and still meant me harm, they
   would muster such firepower for the attempt that my
   odds for survival would be nonexistent.
  "Nunzio," I said slowly, "you may be right, but in
   all honesty what could you and Guido do to stop a
  magical attack on me?"
  "Not a thing," he said calmly. "But they'd probably
   try to knock off your bodyguards first, and that might
   give you time to get away or hit them yourself before
   they could muster a second attack."
  He said it easily, like you or I might say "The sun
   rises in the east," but it shook me. It had never really
   occurred to me how expendable bodyguards are, or how
   readily they accept the dangers of their profession.
  "I'll try to remember that in the future," I said with a
   certain degree of grave humility. "What's more, I think
   I owe you and Guido an apology. Where is Guido,
  anyway?"
  "Upstairs arguing with His Nibbs," Nunzio grinned.
   "As a matter of fact, I was looking for you to break it
   up when I found you had snuck out again."
  "Why didn't you say so in the first place?"
  "What for? There's no rush. They'll be arguing until
   you get there. I figured it was more important to con-
   vince you to quit going out alone."
  I groaned a little inside, but I had learned long ago the
  6               Robert Asprin
  futility of arguing priorities with Nunzio.
   "Well, thanks again for the advice, but I'd better get
  upstairs before those two kill each other."
  With that I headed across the courtyard for the foun-
   tain stairs to our offices....
  Courtyard? Fountain stairs?
  What happened to the humble tent I was walking into
  a minute ago?
  Weelll... I said I was a magician, didn't I? Our little
  stall at the Bazaar is bigger on the inside than it is on the
   outside. Lots bigger. I've lived in royal palaces that
   weren't as big as our "humble tent." I can't take any
   credit for this particular miracle, though, other than the
   fact that it was my work that helped earn us our current
   residence. We live here rent-free courtesy of the Devan
   Merchants Association as partial payment for a little
   job we did for them a while back. That's also how I got
   my bodyguards ... but that's another story,
  Devan Merchants Association, you ask? Okay. For
   the uninitiated, I'll go over this just once. The dimen-
   sion I'm currently residing in is Deva, home of the
   shrewdest deal-drivers in all the known dimensions. You
   may have heard of them. In my own home dimension
   they were called devils, but I have since learned the
   proper pronunciation is Deveels. Anyway, my gracious
   living quarters are the result of my partner and I beating
   the Deveels at their own game ... which is to say we got
   the better of them in a deal. Don't tell anyone, though.
   It would ruin their reputation and maybe even cost me a
   cushy spot. You see, they still don't know they've been
  had.
   Anyway, where was I? Oh, yes. Heading for the of-;
  fices. Normally after sneaking out 1 would stop by the
   stables to share breakfast with Gleep, but with a crisis
   on my hands I decided to forgo the pleasure of my pet's
  MYTH-ING PERSONS            7
  company and get to work. Gleep. He's the dragon
   Aliman was talking about... and I'm not going to try
   to condense that story. It's just too complicated.
  Long before I reached the offices I could hear their
   voices raised in their favorite "song." The lyrics
   changed from time to time, but I knew the melody by
   heart.
  "Incompetent bungler!"
  "Who are you calling an incomplete bungler?"
  "I stand corrected. You are a complete bungler!"
  "You better watch your mouth! Even if you are the
   boss's partner, one more word and I'll...."
  "You'll what? If you threw a punch the safest place
   to be would be where you're aiming."
  "Izzatso?"
  It sounded like I had arrived in the nick of time. Tak-
   ing a deep breath, I casually strolled into the teeth of the
  fracas.
  "Hi, guys." I pretended to be totally unaware of
   what was going on. "Anyone want a bagel?"
  "No, I don't want a bagel!" came the sneering re-
   sponse from one combatant. "What I want is some de-
   cent help."
  "... and while you're at it see what you can do about
   getting me a little respect!" the other countered.
  The latter comment came from Guido, senior of my
   two bodyguards. If anything, he's bigger and nastier
   than his cousin Nunzio.
  The former contribution came from Aahz. Aahz is
   my partner. He's also a demon, a Pervect to be exact,
   and even though he's slightly shorter than I am, he's
   easily twice as nasty as my two bodyguards put together.
  My strategy had worked in that I now had their an-
   noyance focused on me instead of each other. Now,
   realizing the potential devastation of their respective
  8              Robert Asprin
  temperaments individually, much less collectively, I had
   cause to doubt the wisdom of my strategy.
  "What seems to be the trouble?"
  "The trouble," Aahz snarled, "is that your ace ;
  bodyguard here just lost us a couple of clients."
  My heart sank. I mentioned earlier that Aahz and I
   have more money than we know what to do with, but
   old habits die hard. Aahz is the tightest being I've ever
   met when it comes to money, and, living at the Bazaar |
   at Deva, that's saying something! If Guido had really :
  lost a potential customer, we'd be hearing about it for a i
  long time.                                           I
   "Ease up a minute, partner," I said more to stall for
  time than anything else. "I just got here, remember?
   Could you fill me in on a few of the details?"
   Aahz favored Guido with one more dark stare.        I
   "There's not all that much to tell," he said. "I was in
  the middle of breakfast..."
  "He was drinking another meal," Guido translated
  scornfully.
  "... when mush-f or-brains here bellows up that there
   are some customers waiting downstairs in reception. I
   called back that I'd be down in a few, then finished my
  meal."
  "He kept them waiting at least half an hour. You
  can't expect customers to...."
  "Guido, could you hold the editorial asides for one
   round? Please?" I interceded before Aahz could go for
   him. "I'm still trying to get a rough idea of what hap-
   pened, remember? Okay, Aahz. You were saying?"
   Aahz took a deep breath, then resumed his account.
   "Anyway, when I got downstairs, the customers were
   nowhere to be seen. You'd think your man here would
   be able to stall them or at least have the sense to call for
   reinforcements if they started getting twitchy."
  MYTH-ING PERSONS
  "C'mon, Aahz. Guido is supposed to be a body-
   guard, not a receptionist. If some customers got tired of
   waiting for you to show up and left, I don't see where
   you can dodge the blame by shifting it to...."
  "Wait a minute. Boss. You're missing the point.
   They didn't leave!"
  "Come again?"
  "I left 'em there in the reception room, and the next
   thing I know Mr. Mouth here is hollerin' at me for los-
   ing customers. They never came out! Now, like you say,
   I'm supposed to be a bodyguard. By my figuring we've
   got some extra people wandering the premises, and all
   this slob wants to do is yell about whose fault it is."
  "I know whose fault it is," Aahz said with a glare.
   "There are only two ways out of that reception room,
   and they didn't come past me!"
  "Well they didn't come past me!" Guido countered.
  I started to get a very cold feeling in my stomach.
  "Aahz, "I said softly.
  "If you think I don't know when...."
  "AAHZ!"
  That brought him up short. He turned to me with an
   angry retort on his lips, then he saw my expression.
  "What is it, Skeeve? You look as if...."
  "There are more than two ways out of that room."
  We stared at each other in stunned silence for a few
   moments, then we both sprinted for the reception room,
   leaving Guido to trail along behind.
  The room we had selected for our reception area was
   one of the largest in the place, and the only large room
   with easy access from the front door. It was furnished in
   a style lavish enough to impress even those customers
   spoiled by the wonders of the Bazaar who were expect-
   ing to see the home office of a successful magician.
   There was only one problem with it, and that was the
   

   

   

   

   10

  focus of our attention as we dashed in.
  The only decoration that we had kept from the previ-
   ous owners was an ornate tapestry hanging on the north
   wall. Usually I'm faster than Aahz, but this time he beat
   me to the hanging, sweeping it aside with his arm to re-
   veal a heavy door behind it.
   Our worst fears were realized.
   The door was unlocked and standing ajar.
   

   




Chapter Two:



   

   "Success often hinges on choosing a
   reliable partner."
  —REMUS
  "WHAT'S that?" Guido demanded, taking advantage of
   our stunned silence.
  "It's a door," I said.
  "An open door, to be specific," Aahz supplied.
  "I can see that for myself!" the bodyguard roared. "I
   meant what is it doing here?"
  "It would look pretty silly standing alone in the mid-
   dle of the street now, wouldn't it?" Aahz shot back.
  Guido purpled. As I've said, these two have a positive
   talent for getting under each other's skins.
  "Now look, all I'm askin'...."
  "Guido, could you just hang on for a few minutes
   until we decide what to do next? Then we'll explain, I
   promise."
  My mind was racing over the problem, and having
   Aahz and Guido going at each other did nothing for my
   concentration.
  "I think the first thing we should do, partner," Aahz
  11
   

   

   

   

   12 Robert Asprin
  said thoughtfully, "is to get the door closed so that we
   won't be... interrupted while we work this out."
  Rather than answer, I reached out a cautious toe and
   pushed the door shut. Aahz quickly slipped two of the
   bolts in place to secure it.
  That done, we leaned against the door and looked at
   each other in silence.
  "Well? What do you think?" I asked at last.
  "I'm in favor of sealing it up again and forgetting the
   whole thing."
  "Think it's safe to do that?"
  "Don't know, really. Not enough information."
  We both turned slowly to level thoughtful stares at
   Guido.
  "Say, uh, Guido, could you tell us a little more about
   those customers who came in this morning?"
  "Nothing doin'." Guido crossed his arms. "You're
   the guys who insist on 'information for information.'
   Right? Well, I'm not telling you anything more until
   somebody tells me about that door. I mean, I'm sup-
   posed to be your bodyguard and nobody bothers to tell
   me there's another way into this place?"
  Aahz bared his teeth and started forward, but I
   caught him by the shoulder.
  "He's right, partner. If we want his help, we owe him
   an explanation."
  We locked eyes again for a moment, then he shrugged
   and retreated.
  "Actually, Guido, the explanation is very sim-
   ple. ..."
  "That'll be a first," the bodyguard grumbled.
  In a bound, Aahz was across the room and had Guido
   by the shirt front.
  "You wanted an explanation? Then SHUT UP AND
   LET HIM EXPLAIN!"
  MYTH-ING PERSONS           13
  Now Guido is no lightweight, and he's never been
   short in the courage department. Still, there's nothing
   quite like Aahz when he's really mad.
  "0—Okay! Sorry! Go ahead. Boss. I'm listening."
   Aahz released his grip and returned to his place by the
  door, winking at me covertly as he went.
   "What happened is this," I said, hiding a smile.
  "Aahz and I found that door when we first moved in
  here. We didn't like the looks of it, so we decided to
  leave it alone. That's all."
  "That's all!? A back door that even you admit looks
   dangerous and all you do is ignore it? And if that wasn't
   bad enough, you don't even bother to tell your body-
   guards about it? Of all the lamebrained, half...."
  Aahz cleared his throat noisily, and Guido regained
   control of himself... rapidly.
  "Aahh... what I mean to say is ... oh well. That's
   all behind us now. Could you give me a little more in-
   formation now that the subject's out in the open?
   What's on the other side of that door, anyway?"
   "We don't know," I admitted.
   "YOU DON'T KNOW?" Guido shrieked.
   "What we do know," Aahz interrupted hastily, "is
   what isn't on the other side. What isn't there is any di-
   mension we know about."
  Guido blinked, then shook his head. "I don't get it.
   Could you run that past me again ... real slow?"
  "Let me try," I said. "Look, Guido, you already
   know about dimensions, right? How we're living in the
   dimension Deva, which is an entirely different world
   than our own home dimension of Klah? Well, the
   people here, the Deveels, are masters of dimension
   travel to a point where they build their houses across the
   dimension barriers. That's how come this place is bigger
   on the inside than it is on the outside. The door is in
   

   

   

   

   14             Robert Asprin
  Deva, but the rest of the house is in another dimension.
   That means if we go through that door, the back door
   that we've just shown you, we'd be in another world ...
   one we know nothing about. That's why we were willing
   to leave it sealed up rather than stick our noses out into
  a completely unknown situation."
  "I still think you should have checked it out," the
  bodyguard insisted stubbornly.
  "Think again," Aahz supplied. "You've only seen
  two dimensions. Skeeve here has visited a dozen. I've
   been to over a hundred myself. The Deveels you see here
   at the Bazaar, on the other hand, know over a thousand
  different dimensions."
  "So?"
   "So we think they gave us this place because it opens
  into a dimension that they don't want... 'don't want'
   as in 'scared to death of. Now, you've seen what a
   Deveel will brave to turn a profit. Do you want to go ex-
   ploring in a world that's too mean for them to face?"
  "I see what you mean."
  "Besides." Aahz finished triumphantly, "take an-
   other look at that door. It's got more locks and bolts
  than three ordinary bank vaults."
  "Somebody opened it," Guido said pointedly.
   That took some of the wind out of Aahz's sails.
  Despite himself, he shot a nervous glance at the door.
   "Well... a good thief with a lockpick working from
  this side...."
  "Some of these locks weren't picked, Aahz."
  I had been taking advantage of their discussion to do
   a little snooping, and now held up one of my discoveries
   for their inspection. It was a padlock with the metal
   shackle snapped off. There were several of them scat-
   tered about, as if someone had gotten impatient with the
  MYTH-ING PERSONS           15
  lockpick and simply torn the rest of them apart with his
   hands.
  Guido pursed his lips in a silent whistle. "Man, that's
   strong. What kind of person could do that?"
  "That's what we've been trying to get you to tell us,"
   Aahz said nastily. "Now, if you don't mind, what were
   those customers like?"
  "Three of them... two men and a woman... fairly
   young-looking, but nothing special. Klahds by the look
   of 'em. Come to think of it, they did seem a bit nervous,
   but I thought it was just because they were coming to see
   a magician."
  "Well, now they're on the other side of the door."
   Aahz scooped up one of the undamaged locks and
   snapped it into place. "I don't think they can pick
   locks, or break them if they can't reach 'em. They're
   there, which is their problem, self-inflicted I might add,
   and we're here. End of puzzle. End of problem."
  "Do you really think so, Aahz?"
  "Trust me."
  Somehow that phrase struck a familiar chord in my
   memory, and the echoes weren't pleasant. I was about
   to raise this point with Aahz when Nunzio poked his
   head in the door.
  "Hey, Boss. You got visitors."
  "See?" my partner exclaimed, beaming. "I told you
   things could only get better! It's not even noon and
   we've got more customers."
  "Actually," Nunzio clarified, "it's a delegation of
   Deveels. I think it's the landlord."
  "The landlord?" Aahz echoed hollowly.
  "See how much better things have gotten?" I said
   with a disgusted smirk. "And it's not even noon."
  "Shall I run 'em off, Boss?" Guido suggested.
   

   

   

   

   16              Robert Asprin
  "I think you'd better see *em," Nunzio advised.
   "They seem kind'a upset. Something about us harbor-
   ing fugitives."
  Aahz and I locked gazes in silence, which was only
  natural as there was nothing more to be said. With a
   vague wave that bordered on a nervous tick, I motioned
  for Nunzio to show the visitors in.
  As expected, it was the same delegation of four from
   the Devan Chamber of Commerce who had originally
   hired us to work for the Bazaar, headed by our old ad-
   versary, Hay-ner. Last time we dealt with him, we had
   him over a barrel and used the advantage mercilessly.
   While he had agreed to our terms, I always suspected it
   had hurt his Devan pride to cut such a generous deal and
   that he had been waiting ever since to pay us back. From
   the smile on his face as he entered our reception room, it
   appeared he felt his chance had finally come.
  "Aahh, Master Skeeve," he said. "How good of you
   to see us so promptly without an appointment. I know
   how busy you are, so I'll come right to the point. I
   believe there are certain individuals in residence here
   that our organization is most anxious to speak with. If
   you would be so kind as to summon them, we won't
  trouble you further."
  "Wait a minute, Hay-ner," Aahz put in before I
  could respond. "What makes you think the people
  you're looking for are here?"
  "Because they were seen entering your tent less than
  an hour ago and haven't come out yet," said the largest
  of Hay-ner's back-up team.
  I noticed that unlike Hay-ner, he wasn't smiling. In
  fact, he looked down-right angry.
  "He must mean the ones who came in earlier," Nun-
   zio suggested helpfully. "You know. Boss, the two guys
  with the broad."

  Aahz rolled his eyes in helpless frustration, and for
   once I was inclined to agree with him.
  "Umm, Nunzio," I said, staring at the ceiling, "why
   don't you and Guido wait outside while we take care of
   this?"
  The two bodyguards trooped outside in silence,
   though I noticed that Guido glared at his cousin with
   such disdain that I suspected a stern dressing-down
   would take place even before I could get to him myself.
   The Mob is no more tolerant than magicians of staff
   members who say more than they should in front of the
   opposition.
  "Now that we've established that we all know who
   we're talking about and that they're here," Hay-ner
   said, rubbing his hands together, "call them out and
   we'll finish this once and for all."
  "Not so fast," I interrupted. "First of all, neither of
   us have laid eyes on those folks you're looking for,
   because, second of all, they aren't here. They took it on
   the lam out the back door before we could meet them."
  "Somehow, I don't expect you to take our word for
   it," Aahz added. "So feel free to search the place."
  The Deveel's smile broadened, and I was conscious of
   cold sweat breaking out on my brow.
  "That won't be necessary. You see, whether I believe
   you or not is of little consequence. Even if we searched,
   I'm sure you would be better at hiding things than we
   would be at finding them. All that really matters is that
   we've established that they did come in here, and that
   makes them .your responsibility."
  I wasn't sure exactly what was going on here, but I
   was sure that I was liking it less and less with each pass-
   ing moment.
  "Wait a minute, Hay-ner," I began. "What do you
   mean 'We're responsible'? Responsible for what?"
   

   

   

   

   18              Robert Asprin                 ;
  "Why, for the fugitives, of course. Don't you remem- |
   ber? When we agreed to let you use this place rent-free,
   part of the deal was that if anyone of this household
   broke any of the Bazaar rules, and either disappeared
   off to another dimension or. otherwise refused to face ;
  the charges, that you would personally take responsibil-
   ity for their actions. It's a standard clause in any Bazaar
  lease."
  "Aahz," I said testily, "you cut the deal. Was there a
  clause like that in it?"                                 |
  "There was," he admitted. "But I was thinking of
   Tananda and Chumley at the time... and we'll stand
   behind them anytime. Massha, too. It never occurred to
   me that they'd try to claim that anyone who walked
   through our door was a member of our household. I
   don't see how they can hope to prove...."
  "We don't have to prove that they're in your house-
   hold," Hay-ner smiled. "You have to prove they
  aren't."                                        I
   "That's crazy," Aahz exploded. "How can we |
  prove...."                                      I
  "Can it, Aahz. We can't prove it. That's the point. |
   All right, Hay-ner. You've got us. Now what exactly
   have these characters done that we're responsible for
   and what are our options? I thought one of the big sales
   points of the Bazaar was that there weren't any rules
  here."
  "There aren't many," the Deveel said, "but the few
   that do exist are strictly enforced. The specific rule your
   friends broke involves fraud."
   He quickly held up a hand to suppress my retort.
   "I know what you're going to say. Fraud sounds like
   a silly charge with all the hard bargaining that goes on
   here at the Bazaar, but to us it's a serious matter. While
   we pride ourselves in driving a hard bargain, once the
  MYTH-ING PERSONS           19
  deal is made you get the goods you were promised.
   Sometimes there are specific details omitted in describ-
   ing the goods, but anything actually said is true. That is
   our reputation and the continued success of the Bazaar
   depends on that reputation being scrupulously main-
   tained. If a trader or merchant sells something claiming
   it to be magical and it turns out to have no powers at all,
   that's fraud ... and if the perpetrators are allowed to go
   unpunished, it could mean the end of the Bazaar as we
   know it."
  "Actually," I said drily, "all I was going to do was
   protest you billing them as our friends, but I'll let it go.
   What you haven't mentioned is our options."
  Hay-ner shrugged. "There are only three, really. You
   can pay back the money they took falsely plus a twenty-
   five percent fine, accept permanent banishment from
   the Bazaar, or you can try to convince your fr—aahh, I
   mean the fugitives to return to the Bazaar to settle mat-
   ters themselves."
  "I see... Very well. You've had your say. Now
   please leave so my partner and I can discuss our position
   on the matter."
  Aahz took care of seeing them out while I plunged
   into thought as to what we should do. When he re-
   turned, we both sat in silence for the better part of an
   hour before either of us spoke.
  "Well," I said at last, "what do you think?"
  "Banishment from the Bazaar is out!" Aahz snarled.
   "Not only would it destroy our reputations, I'm not
   about to get run out of the Bazaar and our home over
   something as idiotic as this!"
  "Agreed," I said grimly. "Even though it occurs to
   me that Hay-ner is bluffing on that option. He wants us
   to stick around the Bazaar as much as we want to stay.
   He was the one who hired us in the first place, remem-
  Robert Asprin
  20
  ber? I think he's expecting us to ante up and pay the
   money. That way he gets back some of the squeeze he so
   grudgingly parted with. Somehow the idea of giving in
   to that kind of pressure really galls me."
   Aahz nodded. "Me too."
   There followed several more minutes of silence.
   "Okay," Aahz said finally, "who's going to say it?"
   "We're going to have to go after them." I sighed.
   "Half right," Aahz corrected. "I'm going to have to
   go after them. Partner or not, we're talking about hit-
   ting a totally new dimension here, and it's too danger-
   ous for someone at your level of magical skill."
  "My level? How about you? You don't have any
   powers at all. If it's too dangerous for me, what's sup-
   posed to keep you safe?"
   "Experience," he said loftily. "I'm used to doing
  this, and you aren't. End of argument."
  " 'End of argument' nothing! Just how do you pro-
   pose to leave me behind if I don't agree?"
  "That's easy," Aahz grinned. "See who's standing in
  the corner?"
   I turned to look where he was pointing, and that's the
  last thing I remembered for a long time.
   

   




Chapter Three:



   

   "Reliable information is a must for suc-
   cessful planning."
  —C. COLUMBUS
  "HEY! Hot stuff! Wake up!! You okay?"
  If I led a different kind of life, those words would
   have been uttered by a voluptuous vision of female
   loveliness. As it was, they were exclaimed by Massha.
  This was one of the first things that penetrated the
   fogginess of my mind as I struggled to regain con-
   sciousness. I'm never at my best first thing in the morn-
   ing, even when I wake up leisurely of my own accord.
   Having wakefulness forced upon me by someone else
   only guarantees that my mood will be less than pleasant.
  However groggy I might be feeling, though, there was
   no mistaking the fact that it was Massha shaking me
   awake. Even through unfocused eyes, her form was
   unmistakable. Imagine, if you will, the largest, fattest
   woman you've ever met. Now expand that image by
   fifty percent in all directions, top it off with garish
   orange hair, and false eyelashes and purple lipstick, and
   adorn it with a wheelbarrow load of gaudy jewelry. See
  21

  22
  what I mean? I could recognize Massha a mile away on
   a dark night... blindfolded.
  "Of course I'm okay, apprentice'." I snarled. "Don't
   you have any lessons you're supposed to be practicing
   or something?"
  "Are you sure? she pressed mercilessly.
  "Yes, I'm sure. Why do you ask? Can't a fellow take
   a little nap without being badgered about it?"
  "It's just that you don't usually take naps in the
   middle of the reception room floor."
  That got my attention, and I forced my eyes into
   focus. She was right! For some reason I was sprawled
   out on the floor. Now what could have possessed me
  to....
   Then it all came back! Aahz! The expedition into the
  new dimension!
  I sat bolt upright... and regretted it immediately. A
   blinding headache assaulted me with icepick intensity,
   and my stomach flipped over and landed on its back
   with all the grace of a lump of overcooked oatmeal.
  Massha caught me by the shoulder as I started to list.
  "Steady there, High Roller. Looks like your idea of
   'okay' and mine are a little out of synch."
  Ignoring her, I felt the back of my head cautiously
   and discovered a large, tender lump behind my ear. If I
   had had any doubts as to what had happened, they were
  gone now.
  "That bloody Pervert!" I said, flinching at the new
   wave of pain brought on by the sound of my own voice.
   "He must have knocked me out and gone in alone!"
  "You mean Aahz? Dark, green, and scaly himself? I
   don't get it. Why would your own partner sucker-punch
  you?"
  "So he could go through the door without me. I made;
  MYTH-ING PERSONS
  23
  it very clear that I didn't want to be left behind on this
   caper."
  "Door? What door?" Massha said with a frown. "I
   know you two have your secrets, Boss, but I think you'd
   better fill me in on a few more details as to exactly
   what's going on around here."
  As briefly as I could, I brought her up to date on the
   day's events, including the explanation as to why Aahz
   and I had never said anything about the house's mys-
   terious back door. Being a seasoned dimension traveler
   herself, she grasped the concept of an unlisted dimen-
   sion and its potential dangers much more rapidly than
   Guide and Nunzio.
  "What I don't understand is even if he didn't want
   you along, why didn't he take someone else as a back-
   up?"
  "Like who?" I said with a wry grimace. "We've
   already established that you're my apprentice and he
   doesn't give you orders without clearing them through
   me. He's never been impressed with Guido and Nunzio.
   Tananda and Chumley are off on their own contracts
   and aren't due back for several days. Even Gus is taking
   a well-earned vacation with Berfert. Besides, he knows
   good and well that if he started building a team and
   excluded me, there'd be some serious problems before
  the dust settled. I wouldn't take something like that
   lying down!"
  "Don't look now, but you just did," my apprentice
   pointed out dryly, "though I have to admit he sort of
   forced it on you."
  With that, she slid a hand under each of my armpits
   and picked me up, setting me gently on my feet.
  "Well, now what? I supposed you're going to go
   charging after him with blood in your eye. Mind if I tag
  24
  Robert Asprin MYTH-ING PERSONS 25
  along? Or are you bound and determined to be as stupid
   as he is?"
  As a matter of fact, that was exactly what I had been
   planning to do. The undisguised sarcasm in her voice
   combined with the unsettling wobbliness of my legs,
   however, led me to reconsider.
  "No," I said carefully. "One of us blundering
   around out there is enough ... or one too many, de-
   pending on how you count it. While I still think I should
   have gone along, Aahz has dealt this hand, so it's up to
   him to play it out. It's up to me to mind the store until
   he gets back."
  Massha cocked an eyebrow at me.
  "That makes sense," she said, "though I'll admit I'm
   a little surprised to hear you say it."
  "I'm a responsible businessman now." I shrugged.
   "I can't afford to go off half-cocked like a rash kid any-
   more. Besides, I have every confidence in my partner's
   ability to handle things."
  Those were brave words, and I meant them. Two days
   later, however, this particular 'responsible business-
   man' was ready to go off fully cocked. Guido and Nun-
   zio ceased to complain about my sneaking off alone...
   mostly because I didn't go out at all! In fact, I spent
   most of my waking hours and all of my sleeping hours
   (though I'll admit I didn't sleep much) in the reception
   room on the off-chance that I could greet Aahz on his
   triumphant return.
  Unfortunately, my vigil went unrewarded.
  I did my best to hide my concern, but I needn't have
   bothered. As the hours marched on, my staff's worries
   grew until most of my time was spent telling them, "No,
   he isn't back yet. When he gets here, I'll let you know."
   Even Guido, who never really got along with Aahz,
  took to stopping by at least once an hour for a no-prog-
   ress report.
  Finally, as a salve for my own nerves, I called every-
   one into the reception room for a staff meeting.
  "What I want to know is how long are we just going
   to sit around before we admit that something's gone
   wrong?" Guido muttered for the fifth time.
  "How long do you figure it takes to find a fugitive in
   a strange dimension?" I shot back. "How long would it
   take you to find them if they were on Klah, Guido?
   We've got to give him some time."
  "How much time?" he countered. "It's already been
   two days...."
  "Tananda and Chumley will be back any time now,"
   Massha interrupted. "Do you think they'll just sit
   around on their hands when they find out that Aahz is
   out there all alone?"
  "I thought you were the one who thought that going
   after him was a stupid idea?"
  "I still do. Now do you want to know what I think of
   the idea of doing nothingi"
  Before I could answer, a soft knock sounded at the
   door ... the back door!
  "See!" I crowed triumphantly. "I told you he would
   be back!"
  "That doesn't sound like his knock," Guido ob-
   served suspiciously.
  "And why should he knock?" Massha added. "The
   door hasn't been locked since he left."
  In my own relief and enthusiasm, their remarks went
   unnoticed. In a flash I was at the door, wrenching it
   open while voicing the greeting I had been rehearsing
   for two days.
  "It's about time, part... ner."
   

   

   

   

   26
  MYTH-ING PERSONS           27
  Robert Asprin
  It wasn't Aahz.
  In fact, the being outside the door didn't look any-
   thing at all like Aahz. What was doubly surprising,
   though, was that I recognized her!
  We had never really met... not to exchange names,
   but shortly after meeting Aahz I had been strung up by
   an angry mob while impersonating her, and I had seen
   her in the crowd when I successfully "interviewed" for
   the job of court magician at Possletum.
  What I had never had a chance to observe first-hand
   was her radiant complexion framed by waves of sun-
   gold hair, or the easy grace with which she carried her-
   self, or the....
  "It's the Great Skeeve, right? Behind the open
  mouth?"
  Her voice was so musical it took me a few moments to
   zero in on what she had said and realize that she was ex-
   pecting an answer.
  "Aahh ... yes. I mean, at your service,"
  "Glad to finally meet you face-to-face," she said
   briskly, glancing at Guido and Massha nervously. "I've
   been looking for an excuse for a while, and I guess this
   is it. Got some news for you... about your appren-
   tice."
  I was still having problems focusing on what she was
   saying. Not only was her voice mesmerizing, she was
   easily the loveliest woman I had ever met... well, girl
   actually. She couldn't have been much older than me.
   What's more, she seemed to like me. That is, she kept
   smiling hesitantly and her deep blue eyes never left
   mine. Now, I had gotten respect from my colleagues
   and from beings at the Bazaar who knew my reputation,
   but never from anyone who looked like ....
   Then her words sank in.
   "My apprentice?"
  I stole an involuntary glance at Massha before I real-
   ized the misunderstanding.
  "Oh, you mean Aahz. He's not my apprentice any
   more. He's my partner. Please come in. We were just
   talking about him."
  I stood to one side of the door and invited her in with
   a grand sweeping gesture. I'd never tried it before, but I
   had seen it used a couple of times while I was working
   the court at Possletum, and it had impressed me.
  "Umm—Boss? Could I talk to you for a minute?"
  "Later, Guido."
  I repeated the gesture, and the girl responded with a
   quick smile that lit up the room.
  "Thanks for the invite," she said, "but I'll have to
   take a rain check. I really can't stay. In fact, I shouldn't
   be here at all. I just thought that someone should let you
   know that your friend... Aahz is it? Anyway, your
   friend is in jail."
  That brought me back to earth in a hurry.
  "Aahz? In jail? For what?"
  "Murder."
  "MURDER!" I shrieked, dropping all attempts to be
   urbane. "But Aahz wouldn't.. .."
  "Don't shout at me! Oh, I knew I shouldn't have
   come. Look, I know he didn't do it. That's why I had to
   let you know what was going on. If you don't do some-
   thing, they're going to execute him... and they know
   how to execute demons over here."
  I spun around to face the others.
  "Massha! Go get your jewelry case. Guido, Nunzio!
   Gear up. We're going to pay a little call on our neigh-
   bors."
  I tried to keep my voice calm and level, but somehow
   the words came out a bit more intense than I had in-
   tended.
   

   

   

   

   28
  Robert Asprin MYTH-ING PERSONS 29
  "Not so fast. Boss," Guido said. "There's something
   you oughta know first."
  "Later. I want you to...."
  "NOW, Boss. It's important!"
  "WHAT IS IT!"
  Needless to say, I was not eager to enter into any pro-
   longed conversations just now.
  "She's one of'em."
  "I beg your pardon?"
  "The three that went out through the back door. The
   ones your partner is chasing. She's the broad."
  Thunderstruck, I turned to the girl for confirmation,
   only to find the doorway was empty. My mysterious
   visitor had disappeared as suddenly as she had arrived.
  "This could be a trap, you know," Massha said
   thoughtfully.
  "She's right." Guido nodded. "Take it from some-
   one who's been on the lam himself. When you're run-
   ning from the law and there are only a couple of people
   who can find you, it gets real tempting to eliminate that
   link. We've only got her word that your partner's in
  trouble."
  "It wouldn't take a mental giant to figure out that
   you and Aahz are the most likely hunters for the Deveels
   to hire. After all, they knew whose house they were cut-
   ting through for their getaway," Massha added.
   Guido rose to his feet and started pacing.
   "Right," he said. "Now suppose they've got Aahz.
   Can you think of a better way to bag the other half of
   the pair than by feeding you a line about your partner
   being in trouble so you'll come charging into whatever
   trap they've laid out? The whole set-up stinks, Boss. I
   don't know about strange dimensions, but I do know
   about criminals. As soon as you step through that door,
   you're gonna be a sitting duck."
  "Are you quite through?"
  Even to my ears my voice sounded icy, but for a
   change I didn't care.
  Guido and Massha exchanged glances, then nodded
   silently.
  "Very well. You may be right, and I appreciate your
   concern for my well-being. HOWEVER ..."
  My voice sank to a deadly hiss.
  "... what if you're wrong? What if our fugitive is
   telling the truth? You've all been on my case about not
   doing anything to help Aahz. Do you really think I'm
   just going to sit here while my partner AND friend
   burns for a crime he didn't commit ... on the off-
   chance that getting involved might be dangerous to
   me?"
  With great effort I forced my tones back to normal.
  "In ten minutes I'm going through that door after
   Aahz... and if I'm walking into a trap, it had better be
   a good one. Now do any of you want to come with me,
   or am I going it alone?"
   

   

   

   

   




Chapter Four:



   

   "It's useless to try to plan for the unex-
   pected ... by definition!"
  —A. HITCHCOCK
  ACTUALLY, it was more like an hour before we were
   really ready to go, though for me it seemed like a lot
   longer. Still, even I had to admit that not taking the
   proper preparations for this venture would not only be
   foolish, it would be downright suicidal!
  It was decided that Nunzio would stay behind so there
   would be someone at our base to let Tananda and
   Chumley know what was going on when they returned.
   Needless to say, he was less than thrilled by the assign-
   ment.
  "But I'm supposed to be your bodyguard!" he ar-
   gued. "How'm I supposed to guard you if I'm sittin'
   back here while you're on the front lines?"
  "By being sure our support troops get the informa-
   tion they need to follow us," I said.
  As much as I disliked having to argue with Nunzio, I
   would rather dig in my heels against half a dozen Mob-
   type bodyguards than have to explain to Tananda and
  30
  MYTH-ING PERSONS           31
  Chumley why they weren't included in this rescue mis-
   sion.
  "We could leave a note."
  "No."
  "We could...."
  "NO! I want you here. Is that plain enough?"
  The bodyguard heaved a heavy sigh. "Okay, Boss.
   I'll hang in here until they show up. Then the three of us
   will...."
  "No!" I said again. "Then Tananda and Chumley
   will come in after us. You're going to stay here."
  "But Boss...."
  "Because if Hay-ner and his crew show up again,
   someone has to be here to let them know we're on the
   job and that we haven't just taken off for the tall
   timber. Assuming for the moment that we're going to
   make it back, we need our exit route, and you're going
   to be here making sure it stays open. All we need is for
   our hosts to move in a new tenant while we're gone...
   say, someone who decides to brick up this door while
   we're on the other side."
  Nunzio thought this through in silence.
  "What if you don't come back?" he asked finally.
  "We'll burn that bridge when we come to it," I
   sighed. "But remember, we aren't that easy to kill. At
   least one of us will probably make it back."
  Fortunately, my mind was wrenched away from that
   unpleasant train of thought by the arrival of Guido.
  "Ready to go. Boss."
  Despite the desperateness of the situation and the
   haunting time pressures, I found myself gaping at him.
  "What's that?" I managed at last.
  Guido was decked out in a long dark coat and wear-
   ing a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses.
  "These? These are my work clothes," he said
  32 Robert Asprin
  proudly. "They're functional as well as decorative."
  "They're what?"
  "What I mean is, not only do people find 'em in-
   timidating, the trench coat has all these little pockets in-
   side, see? That's where I carry my hardware."
  "But...."
  "Hi, Hot Stuff. Nice outfit, Guido."
  "Thanks! I was just telling the Boss here about it."
  Massha was dressed ... or should I say undressed in
   her work clothes. A brief vest struggled to cover even
   part of her massive torso, while an even briefer bottom
   was on the verge of surrendering its battle completely.
  "Ummm ....assha?" I said carefully. "I've always
   meant to ask. Why don't you... ummm... wear
   more?"
  "I like to dress cool when we're going into a hot situa-
   tion," she winked. "You see, when things speed up, I
   get a little nervous... and the only thing worse than
   havin' a fat broad around is havin' a sweaty fat broad
   around."
  "I think it's a sexy outfit," Guido chimed in. "Re-
   minds me of the stuff my old man's moll used to wear."
  "Well thanks. Dark and Deadly. I'd say your old
   man had good taste ... but I never tasted him."
  I studied them thoughtfully as they shared a laugh
   over Massha's joke. Any hope of a quiet infiltration of
   this unknown dimension was rapidly disintegrating.
   Either Guido or Massha alone was eye-catching, but
   together they were about as inconspicuous as a circus
   parade and an army maneuver sharing the same road.
   Then it occurred to me that, not knowing what things
   were like where we were heading, they might fit in and /
   would stand out. It was a frightening thought. If every-
   body there looked like this....
  I forced the thought from my mind. No use scaring
  MYTH-ING PERSONS           33
  myself any more than I had to before there was in-
   formation to back it up. What was important was that
   my two assistants were scared. They were trying hard
   not to show it, but in doing so, each was dropping into
   old patterns, slipping behind old character masks.
   Guido was playing his "tough gangster" bit to the hilt,
   while Massha was once more assuming her favorite
   "vamp" character with a vengeance. The bottom line,
   though, was that, scared or not, they were willing to
   back my move or die trying. It would have been touch-
   ing, if it weren't for the fact that it meant they were
   counting on me for leadership. That meant I had to stay
   calm and confident... no matter how scared I felt my-
   self. It only occurred to me as an afterthought that, in
   many ways, leadership was the mask / was learning to
   slip behind when things got tight. It made me wonder
   briefly if anyone ever really knew what they were doing
   or felt truly confident, or if life was simply a mass game
   of role-playing.
  "Okay. Are we ready?" I asked, shrugging off my
   wandering thoughts. "Massha? Got your jewelry?"
  "Wearing most of it, and the rest is right here," she
   said, patting the pouch on her belt.
  While I will occasionally make snide mental com-
   ments about my apprentice's jewelry, it serves a dual
   purpose. Massha's baubles are in reality a rather exten-
   sive collection of magical gimmicks she has accumulated
   over the years. How extensive? Well, before she signed
   on as my apprentice to learn real magic, she was holding
   down a steady job as the magician for the city-state of
   Ta-hoe on the dimension of Jahk solely on the strength
   of her collected mechanical "powers." While I agreed
   with Aahz that real magic was preferable to mechanical
   in that it was less likely to malfunction (a lesson learned
   from first-hand experience) I sure didn't mind having

  her arsenal along for back-up.
  "You know that tracking ring? The one you used to
   find the king? Any chance there's an extra tucked away
   in your pouch?"
  "Only have the one," she said, waggling the ap-
   propriate finger.
  I cursed mentally, then made the first of what I feared
   would be many unpleasant decisions on this venture.
  "Give it to Nunzio. Tananda and Chumley will need
   it to find us."
  "But if we leave it behind, how are we going to find
   your partner?"
  "We'll have to figure out something, but we can't
   afford to divide our forces. Otherwise, even if we get
   Aahz, we could still end up wandering around out there
   trying to find the other half of the rescue team."
  "If you say so. Hot Stuff," she grimaced, handing
   over the ring, "but I hope you know what you're
   doing."
  "So do I, Massha, so do I. Okay, gang, let's see what
   our backyard is really like!"
  From the outside, our place looked a lot more impres-
   sive than the side that showed in the Bazaar. It really did
   look like a castle ... a rather ominous one at that,
   squatting alone on a hilltop. I really didn't study it too
   close, though, beyond being able to recognize it again
   for our trip out. As might be expected, my main atten-
   tion was focused on the new dimension itself.
  "Kinda dark, ain't it."
  Guide's comment was more statement than question,
   and he was right.
  Wherever we were, the lighting left a lot to be desired.
   At first I thought it was night, which puzzled me, as so
   far in my travels all dimensions seemed to be on the
  same sun-up and sun-down schedule. Then my eyes
   adjusted to the gloom and I realized the sky was simply
   heavily overcast... to a point where next to no light at
   all penetrated, giving a night-like illusion to the day.
  Aside from that, from what I could see, this new land
   seemed pretty much like any of the others I had visited:
  Trees, underbrush, and a road leading to or from the
   castle, depending on which way you were facing. I think
   it was Tananda who was fond of saying "If you've seen
   one dimension, you've seen them all." Chumley, her
   brother, argued that the reason for the geologic similari-
   ties was that all the dimensions we traveled were differ-
   ent realities off the same base. This always struck me as
   being a bit redundant... "They're all alike because
   they're the same? C'mon Chumley!", but his rebuttals
   always left me feeling like I'd been listening to someone
   doing readings in another language, so of late I've been
   tending to avoid the discussions.
  "Well, Hot Stuff, what do we do now?"
  For a change, I had an answer for this infuriating
   question.
  "This road has to go somewhere. Just the fact that it
   exists indicates we aren't alone in this dimension."
  "I thought we already knew that," Guido said under
   his breath. "That's why we're here."
  I gave him my best dark glare.
  "I believe there was some debate as to whether or not
   we were being lied to about Aahz being held prisoner. If
   there's a road here, it's a cinch that neither my partner
   nor the ones he was chasing built it. That means we have
   native types to deal with . .. possibly hostile."
  "Right," Massha put in quickly. "Put a sock in it,
   Guido. I want to hear our plan of action, and I don't
   like being kept waiting by hecklers."
  The bodyguard frowned, but kept his silence.
   

   

   

   

   36 Robert Asprin
  "Okay. Now, what we've got to do is follow this road
   and find out where it goes. Hug the side of the road and
   be ready to disappear if you hear anybody coming. We
   don't know what the locals look like, and until I have a
   model to work from, it's pointless for me to try to dis-
   guise us."
  With those general marching orders, we made our
   way through the dark along the road, moving quietly to
   avoid tipping our hand to anyone ahead of us. In a short
   time we came up to our first decision point. The road we
   were on ended abruptly when it met another, much
   larger thoroughfare. My assistants looked at me
   expectantly. With a shrug I made the arbitrary decision
   and led them off to the right down this new course. As
   we went, I reflected with some annoyance that even
   though both Massha and Guido knew that I was as new
   to this terrain as they were, it somehow fell to me to
   choose the path.
  My thoughts were interrupted by the sound of voices
   ahead, coming our way. The others heard it too, and
   without word or signal we melted into the underbrush.
   Squatting down, I peered through the gloom toward the
   road, anxious to catch my first glimpse of the native life
   forms.
  I didn't have long to wait. Two figures appeared, a
   young couple by the look of them, talking and laughing
   merrily as they went. They looked pretty normal to me,
   which was a distinct relief, considering the forms I had
   had to imitate in some of the other dimensions. They
   were humanoid enough to pass for Klahds... or Jahks,
   actually, as they were a bit pale. Their dress was not dis-
   similar from my own, though a bit more colorful. Ab-
   sorbing all this in a glance, I decided to make my first
   try for information. I mean, after all my fears, they
   were so familiar it was almost a letdown, so why not
  MYTH-ING PERSONS           37
  bull ahead? Compared with some of the beings I've had
   to deal with in the past, this looked like a piece of cake.
  Signaling the others to stay put, I stepped out onto
   the road behind my target couple.
  "Excuse me!" I called "I'm new to this area and in
   need of a little assistance. Could you direct me to the
   nearest town?"
  Translation pendants were standard equipment for
   dimension travel, and as I was wearing one now, I had
   no fear of not being understood.
  The couple turned to face me, and I was immediately
   struck by their eyes. The "whites" of their eyes glowed
   a dark red, sending chills down my spine. It occurred to
   me that I might have studied the locals a bit longer
   before I tried to pass myself off as a native. It also
   occurred to me that I had already committed myself to
   this course of action and would have to bluff my way
   through it regardless. Finally, it occurred to me that I
   was a suicidal idiot and that I hoped Massha and Guido
   were readying their back-up weapons to save me from
   my own impatience.
  Strangely enough, the couple didn't seem to notice
   anything unusual about my appearance.
  "The nearest town? That would be Blut. It's not far,
   we just came from there. It's got a pretty wild night life,
   if you're into that kind of thing."
  There was something about his mouth that nagged at
   the edges of my mind. Unfortunately, I couldn't look at
   it directly without breaking eye contact, so, buoyed by
   my apparent acceptance, I pushed ahead with the con-
   versation.
  "Actually, I'm not too big on night life. I'm trying to
   run down an old friend of mine I've lost touch with. Is
   there a post office or a police station in Blut I could ask
   at?"
  38 Robert Asprin
  "Better than that," the man laughed. "The one you
   want to talk to is the Dispatcher. He keeps tabs on
   everybody. The third warehouse on your left as you
   enter town. He's converted the whole second floor into
   an office. If he can't help you, nobody can."
  As vital as the information was, I only paid it partial
   attention. When the man laughed, I had gotten a better
   look at his mouth. His teeth were....
  "Look at his teeth!" the girl gasped, speaking for the
   first time.
  "My teeth?" I blinked, realizing with a start that she
   was staring at me with undisguised astonishment.
  Her companion, in the meantime, had paled notice-
   ably and was backing away on unsteady legs.
  "You ... you're ... Where did you come from?"
  Trying my best to maintain a normal manner until I
   had figured out what was going on, I moved forward to
   keep our earlier conversational distance.
  "The castle on the hill back there. I was just...."
  "THE CASTLE!?!"
  In a flash the couple turned and sprinted away from
   me down the road.
  "Monster!! Help!! MONSTER!!!"
  I actually spun and looked down the road behind me,
   trying to spot the object of their terror. Looking at the
   empty road, however, it slowly began to sink in. They
   were afraid of me\ Monster?
  Of all the reactions I had tried to anticipate for our
   reception in this new land, I had never in my wildest
   imaginings expected this.
  Me? A monster?
  "I think we've got problems. High Roller," Massha
   said as she and Guido emerged from the brush at my
   side.
  MYTH-ING PERSONS           39
  "I'll say. Unless I'm reading the signs all wrong,
   they're afraid of me."
  She heaved a great sigh and shook her head.
  "That's not what I'm talking about. Did you see their
   teeth?"
  "I saw his," I said."The canines were long and
   pointed. Pretty weird, huh?"
  "Not all that weird, Hot Stuff. Think about it. My
   bet is that you were just talking to a couple of vam-
   pires!"

Chapter Five:



   

   "To survive, one must be able to adapt to
   changing situations."
  —TYRANNOSAURUS REX
  "VAMPIRES," I said carefully.
  "Sure. It all fits." Massha nodded. "The pale skin,
   the sharp fangs, the red eyeliner, the way they turned
   into bats...."
  "Turned into bats?"
  "You missed it. Boss," Guido supplied. "You were
   lookin' behind you when they did it. Wildest thing I ever
   saw. One second they was runnin' for their lives, and
   the next they're flutterin' up into the dark. Are all the
   other dimensions like this?"
  "Vampires...."
  Actually, my shock wasn't all that great. Realizing
   the things Aahz and I had run into cruising the so-called
   "known and safe" dimensions, I had expected some-
   thing a bit out of the ordinary in this one. If anything, I
   was a bit relieved. The second shoe had been dropped
   ... and it really wasn't all that bad! That is, it could
   have been worse. (If hanging around with Aahz had
  40
  taught me anything, it was that things could always be
   worse!) The repetitive nature of my conversational bril-
   liance was merely a clever ploy to cover my mental ef-
   forts to both digest this new bit of information and
   decide what to do with it.
  "Vampires are rare in any dimension," my appren-
   tice replied, stepping into the void to answer Guide's
   question. "What's more, they're pretty much feared
   universally. What I can't figure out is why those two
   were so scared of Skeeve here."
  "Then again," I said thoughtfully, "there's the ques-
   tion of whether or not we can safely assume the whole
   dimension is populated with beings like the two we just
   met. I know it's a long shot, but we might have run into
   the only two vampires in the place."
  "I dunno. High Roller. They acted pretty much at
   home here, and they sure didn't think you'd find any-
   thing unusual about their appearance. My guess is that
   they're the norm and we're the exceptions around
   here."
  "Whatever," I said, reaching a decision at last,
   "they're the only two examples we have to work with so
   far, so that's what we'll base our actions on until proven
   different."
  "So what do we do against a bunch of vampires?"
  As a bodyguard, Guido seemed a bit uneasy about
   our assessment of the situation.
  "Relax," I smiled. "The first order of business is to
   turn on the old reliable disguise spell. Just a few quick
   touch-ups and they won't be able to tell us apart from
   the natives. We could walk through a town of vampires
   and they'd never spot us."
  With that, I closed my eyes and went to work. Like I
   told the staff, this was going to be easy. Maintain
   everyone's normal appearance except for paler skin,
   

   

   

   

   42
  MYTH-ING PERSONS           43
  Robert Asprin
  longer canines, and a little artful reddening of the eyes,
   and the job was done.
  "Okay," I said, opening my eyes again. "What's
   next?"
  "I don't like to quote you back at yourself. Hot
   Stuff," Massha drawled, "but didn't you say something
   about disguises being the first thing before we went any
   further?"
  "Of course. That's why I just. .. wait a minute. Are
   you trying to say we still have the same appearance as
   before I cast the spell?"
  One of the problems with casting a disguise spell is
   that as the caster, I can never see the effects. That is, I
   see people as they really are whether the spell is on or
   not. I had gotten so used to relying on the effects of this
   particular spell that it had never occurred to me that it
   might not work.
  Massha and Guido were looking at each other with no
   small degree of concern.
  "ymmm ... maybe you forgot."
  "Try again."
  "That's right! This time remember to...."
  "Hold it, you two," I ordered in my most com-
   manding tone. "From your reactions, I perceive that the
   answer to my questions is 'yes.' That is, that the spell
   didn't work. Now just ease up a second and let me
   think. Okay?"
  For a change they listened to me and lapsed into a
   respectful silence. I might have taken a moment to savor
   the triumph if I wasn't so worried about the problem.
  The disguise spell was one of the first spells I had
   learned, and until now was one of my best and most
   reliable tools. If it wasn't working, something was
   seriously wrong. Now I knew that stepping through the
   door hadn't lessened my knowledge of that particular
  spell, so that meant that if something was haywire, it
   would have to be in the....
  "Hey, Hot Stuff! Check the force lines!"
  Apparently my apprentice and I had reached the con-
   clusion simultaneously. A quick magical scan of the sky
   overhead and the surrounding terrain confirmed my
   worst fears. At first I thought there were no force lines
   at all. Then I realized that they were there, but so faint
   that it took nearly all of my reserve power just to detect
   them.
  "What's all this about force lines?" Guido de-
   manded.
  Massha heaved an impatient sigh.
  "If you're going to run with this crowd. Dark and
   Deadly, you'd best start learning a little about the magic
   biz ... or at least the vocabulary. Force lines are invis-
   ible streams of energy that flow through the ground and
   the air. They're the source of power we tap into when
   we do our bibbity-bobbity-boo schtick. That means that
   in a land like this one, where the force lines are either
   non-existent or very weak...."
  ". .. you can't do squat," the bodyguard finished for
   her. "Hey, Boss! If what she says is true, how come
   those two you just met could still do that bat-trick?"
  "By being very, very good in the magic department.
   To do so much with so little means they don't miss a
   trick... pardon the pun ... in tapping and using force
   lines. In short, they're a lot better than either Massha or
   me at the magic game."
  "That makes sense." Massha nodded. "In any di-
   mension I've been in that had vampires, they were some
   of the strongest magic-slingers around. If this is what
   they have to train on, I can see why they run hog-wild
   when they hit a dimension where the force lines are both
   plentiful and powerful."

  I rubbed my forehead, trying desperately to think and
   to forestall the headache I felt coming on. Right on
   schedule, things were getting worse!
  "I don't suppose you have anything in your jewelry
   collection that can handle disguises, do you?"
  Despite our predicament, Massha gave a low laugh.
  "Think about it. High Roller. If I had anything that
   could do disguises, would I walk around looking like
   this?"
  "So we get to take on a world of hot-shot magic types
   with our own cover fire on low ammo," Guido sum-
   marized.
  "Okay. So it'll be a little tougher than I thought at
   first. Just remember my partner has been getting along
   pretty well these last few years without any powers at
   all."
  "Your partner is currently sitting in the hoosegow for
   murder," Guido said pointedly. "That's why we're here
   in the first place. Remember?"
  "Besides," I continued, ignoring his comment (that's
   another skill I've learned from Aahz), "it's never been
   our intention 'to take on the whole world.' All we want
   to do is perform a quick hit and run. Grab Aahz and get
   back out with as little contact with the natives as pos-
   sible. All this means is that we've got to be a little more
   careful. That's all."
  "What about running down the trio we started out to
   retrieve?"
  I thought briefly about the blonde who had warned us
   of Aahz's predicament.
  "That's part of being more careful," I announced
   solemnly. "If ... I mean, when we get Aahz out of jail,
   we'll head for home and count ourselves as lucky. So we
   ... pay off the Deveels. It's a ... cheap price to ... pay
   for...."
  MYTH-ING PERSONS           45
  I realized the staff was looking at me a little askance.
   I also realized that my words had been gradually slow-
   ing to a painful broken delivery as I reached the part
   about paying off the Deveels.
  I cleared my throat and tried again.
  "Ummm, let's just say we'll reappraise the situation
   once we've reached Aahz. Okay?"
  The troops still looked a little dubious, so I thought it
   would be best if I pushed on to the next subject.
  "As to the opposition, let's pool our knowledge of
   vampires so we have an idea of what we're up against.
   Now, we know they can shapechange into bats or
   dogs...."
  "... or just into a cloud of mist," Massha supplied.
  "They drink blood,'' Guido said grimly.
  "They don't like bright light, or crosses...."
  "... and they can be killed by a stake through their
   heart or...."
  "They drink blood."
  "Enough with the drinking blood! Okay, Guido?"
  I was starting to get more than a little annoyed with
   my bodyguard's endless pessimism. I mean, none of us
   was particularly pleased by the way things were going,
   but there was nothing to be gained by dwelling on the
   negatives.
  "Sorry, Boss. I guess looking on the dark side of
   things gets to be a habit in my business."
  "Garlic!" Massha exclaimed suddenly.
  "What's that?"
  "I said 'garlic'," she repeated. "Vampires don't like
   garlic!"
  "That's right! How about it, Guido? Do you have
   any garlic along?"
  The bodyguard actually looked embarrassed.
  "Can't stand the stuff," he admitted "The other
  46 Robert Asprin
  boys in the Mob used to razz me about it, but it makes
   me break out in a rash."
  Terrific. We probably had the only Mob member in
   existence who was allergic to garlic. Another brilliant
   idea shot to hell.
  "Well," I said, heaving a sigh, "now we know what
   we're up against."
  "Ummm... say. Hot Stuff?" Massha said softly.
   "All kidding aside. Aren't we a little overmatched on
   this one? I mean, Dark and Deadly here can hold up his
   end on the physical protection side, but I'm not sure my
   jewelry collection is going to be enough to cover us mag-
   ically."
  "I appreciate the vote of confidence," Guido smiled
   sadly, "but I'm not sure my hardware is going to do us a
   lick of good against vampires. With the Boss out of ac-
   tion on the magic side...."
  "Don't count me out so fast. My magic may not be at
   full power, but I can still pull off a trick or two if things
   really get rough."
  Massha frowned. "But the force lines...."
  "There's one little item I've omitted from your
   lessons so far, apprentice," I said with a smug little
   grin. "It hasn't really been necessary what with the
   energy so plentiful on Deva ... as a matter of fact, I've
   kind of gotten out of the habit myself. Anyway, what it
   boils down to is that you don't always tap into a force
   line to work magic. You can store the energy internally
   like a battery so that it's there when you need it. While
   we've been talking, I've been charging up, so I can pro-
   vide a bit of magical cover as needed. Now, I won't be
   able to do anything prolonged like a constant disguise
   spell, and what I've got I'll want to use carefully
   because it'll take a while to recharge after each use, but
   we won't be relying on your jewelry completely."
  MYTH-ING PERSONS           47
  I had expected a certain amount of excitement from
   the staff when they found out I wasn't totally helpless.
   Instead, they looked uncomfortable. They exchanged
   glances, then looked at the sky, then at the ground.
  "Ummm... does this mean we're going on?" Guido
   said at last.
  "That's right," I said, lips tight. "In fact, I probably
   would have gone on even if my powers were completely
   gone. Somewhere out there my partner's in trouble, and
   I'm not going to back away from at least trying to help
   him. I'd do the same if it was one of you, but we're talk-
   ing about Aahz here. He's saved my skin more times
   than I care to remember. I can't just...."
  I caught myself and brought my voice back under
   control.
  "Look," I said, starting again. "I'll admit we never
   expected this vampire thing when we started out, and
   the limited magic handicap is enough to give anyone
   pause. If either or both of you want to head back, you
   can do it without hard feelings or guilt trips. Really. The
   only reason I'm pushing on is that I know me. Whatever
   is up ahead, it can't be any worse than what I would put
   myself through if I left Aahz alone to die without trying
   my best to bail him out. But that's me. If you want out,
   go ahead."
  "Don't get your back up. Hot Stuff," Massha chided
   gently. "I'm still not sure how much help I'm going to
   be, but I'll tag along. I'd probably have the same prob-
   lem if anything happened to you and I wasn't there, that
   you'd have if anything happened to Aahz. I am your ap-
   prentice, you know."
  "Bodyguarding ain't much, but it's all I know,"
   Guido said glumly. "I'm supposed to be guardin' that
   body of yours, so where it goes, I go. I'm just not wild
   about the odds, know what I mean?"
  48 Robert Asprin
  "Then it's settled," I said firmly. "All right. As I see
   it, our next stop is Blut."
  "Blut," Massha echoed carefully.
  "That's right. I want to look up this Dispatcher
   character and see what he has to say. I mean, a town is a
   town, and we've all visited strange towns before. What
   we really need now is information, and the nearest
   source seems to be Blut."
  "The Dispatcher," Massha said without enthusi-
   asm."
  "Blut," Guido repeated with even less joyful an-
   ticipation.
  It occurred to me that while my assistants were bound
   and determined to stay with me on this caper, if I
   wanted wholehearted support, I'd better look for it
   from the natives... a prospect I didn't put much hope
   in at all.
   

   




Chapter Six:



   

   "An agent is a vampire with a tele-
   phone!"
  —ANY EDITOR
  REMEMBER how I said that if you've seen one town,
   you've seen 'em all? Well, forget it. Even though I've
   visited a lot of dimensions and seen a lot of towns, I had
   to admit that Blut looked a little strange.
  Everything seemed to be done to death in basic black.
   (Perhaps "done to death" is an unfortunate turn of a
   phrase. Whatever.) Mind you, when I say everything, I
   mean everything. Cobblestones, walls, roof tiles, every-
   thing had the same uninspired color scheme. Maybe by
   itself the black overtones wouldn't have seemed too
   ominous, if it weren't for the architectural decorations
   that seemed to abound everywhere you looked. Stone
   dragons and snakes adorned every roof peak and ledge,
   along with the inescapable gargoyles and, of course,
   bats. I don't mean "bats" here, I mean "BATS"!!! Big
   bats, little bats, bats with their wings half open and
   others with their wings spread wide... BATS!!! The
   only thing they all seemed to have in common (besides

  being black) was mouths full of needle-sharp teeth...
   an image which did nothing to further the confidence of
   my already nervous party. I myself felt the tension in-
   creasing as we strode down the street under the noses of
   those fierce adornments. One almost expected the stone
   figures to come to life and swoop down on us for a pint
   or two of dinner.
  "Cheerful sort of place, isn't it?" Massha asked, eye-
   ing the rooftops,
  "I don't like to complain, Boss," Guido put in, lyings
   blatantly, "but I've been in friendlier-looking grave-;
  yards."                                             |
  "Will you both keep your mouths shut!" I snarled,
   speaking as best I could through tightly pressed lips.
   "Remember our disguises."                        J
  I had indeed turned on my disguise spell as we entered
   town, but in an effort to conserve magical energy, I had
   only turned our eyes red. If any of the others on the
   street, and there were lots of them, happened to spot
   our non-vampirish teeth, the balloon would go up once
   and for all. Then again, maybe not. We still hadn't;
  figured out why the couple we met on the road had been
   so afraid of me, but I wasn't about to bank the success
   of our mission on anything as flimsy as a hope that the |
   whole town would run at the sight of our undisguised
   features.
  Fortunately, I didn't have to do any magical tinkering'
   with our wardrobe. If anything, we were a little drab
   compared to most of the vampires on the street. Though
   most of them appeared rather young, barely older than
   me, they came in all shapes and sizes, and were decked
   out in some of the most colorful and outrageous garb it
   has ever been my misfortune to encounter as they;
  shouted to each other or wove their way in and out of
   taverns along the street.
  It was night now, the clouds having cleared enough to
   show a star-studded night sky, and true to their billing,
   vampires seemed to love the night life.
  "If everybody here is vampires," Guido said, ignor-
   ing my warning, "how do they find anybody to bite for
   blood?"
  "As far as I can tell," Massha answered, also choos-
   ing to overlook the gag order, "they buy it by the bot-
   tle."
  She pointed to a small group of vampires sitting on a
   low wall merrily passing a bottle of red liquid back and
   forth among themselves. Despite our knowledge of the
   area, I had subconsciously assumed they were drinking
   wine. Confronted by the inescapable logic that the stuff
   they were drinking was typed, not aged, my stomach did
   a fast roll and dip to the right.
  "If you two are through sightseeing," I hissed, "let's
   try to find this Dispatcher character before someone in-
   vites us to join them for a drink."
  With that, I led off my slightly subdued assistants,
   nodding and waving at the merrymaking vampires as we
   went. Actually, the goings on looked like a lot of fun,
   and I might have been tempted to join in, if it weren't
   for the urgency of our quest....nd, of course, the fact
   that they were vampires.
  Following the instructions I had gleaned from the
   couple on the road before their panicky flight, we found
   the Dispatcher's place with no problem. Leaving Guido
   outside as a lookout, Massha and I braved the stairs and
   entered the Dispatcher's office.
  As strange as Blut had appeared, it hadn't prepared
   me for the room we stepped into.
  There were hundreds of glass pictures lining the walls,
   pictures which depicted moving, living things much like
   looking into a rack of fishbowls. What was more, the
   

   

   

   

   52 Robert Asprin
  images being displayed were of incredible violence and
   unspeakable acts being performed on seemingly helpless
   victims. The overall effect was neither relaxing nor
   pleasant... definitely not something I'd want on the
   wall at home.
  I was so entranced by the pictures, I almost missed the
   Dispatcher himself until he rose from his desk. Perhaps
   "rose" is the wrong description. What he actually did
   was hop down to the floor from his chair which was
   high to begin with, but made higher by the addition of a
   pillow to the seat.
  He strode forward, beaming widely, with his hand ex-
   tended for a handshake.
  "Hi there Vilhelm's the name Your problem is my
   problem Don't sit down Standing problems I solve for
   free Sitting problems I charge for Reasonable rates Just
   a minor percentage off the top What can I do for you?"
  That was sort of all one sentence in that he didn't
   pause for breath. He did, however, seize my hand,
   pump it twice, then repeated the same procedure with
   Massha, then grabbed my hand again ... all before he
   stopped talking.
  All in all, it was a little overpowering. I had a flash
   impression of a short, stocky character with plump rosy
   cheeks and a bad case of the fidgets. I had deliberately
   tried not to speculate on what the Dispatcher would
   look like, but a cherub vampire still caught me a little
   off-guard.
  "I... ummm... how did you know I have a prob-
   lem?"
  That earned me an extra squeeze of the hand and a
   wink.
  "Nobody comes in here unless they've got a prob-
   lem," he said, finally slowing down his speech a bit. "I
   mean, I could always use a bit of help, but does anyone
  MYTH-ING PERSONS           5B
  leap forward to lend a hand? Fat chance. Seems like the
   only time I see another face in the flesh is when it means
   more work for me. Prove me wrong... please! Tell me
   you came in here to take over for an hour or so to let me
   duck out for a bite to drink."
  "Well, actually, we've got a problem and we were
   told....,"
  "See! What did I tell you? All right. What have you
   got? A standing or a sitting problem? Standing prob-
   lems I handle for...."
  He was off again. In a desperate effort to keep our
   visit short, I interrupted his pitch.
  "We're looking for a friend who...."
  "Say no more! A friend! Just a second!"
  With that he vaulted back into his chair, grabbed the
   top off a strange-looking appliance on his desk, diddled
   with it briefly, then started talking into it.
  "Yea Darwin? Vilhelm. I need ... sure...."
  Leaning back in his chair, he tucked the gadget under
   one side of his head and grabbed another.
  "This is Vilhelm, Is Kay around? ... Well, put her on
   when she's done...."
  The second gadget slid in under the same ear as the
   first and he reached for yet another.
  "I know I shouldn't ask this," I murmured to
   Massha, "but what's he doing?"
  "Those are telephones," she whispered back as a
   fourth instrument came into play. "You talk into one
   end of it and whoever's at the other end can hear you
   and talk back. It beats running all over town to find an
   answer."
  By this time, the little vampire had so many instru-
   ments hung from his shoulders and arms he looked like
   he was being attacked by a nest of snakes. He seemed to
   be handling it well, though, talking first into one, then
  54 Robert Asprin
  another, apparently keeping multiple conversations
   going at once like a juggler handles a basket full of
   balls.
  "Gee, that's kind of neat!" I exclaimed. "Do you
   think we could get some of these for our place at the
   Bazaar?"
  "Believe me, they're more trouble than they're
   worth," Massha said. "In nothing flat you find you're
   spending all your time on the phone talking to people
   and not accomplishing anything. Besides, ever since
   they broke up the corporation...."
  "I think I've got it!" Vilhelm announced, jumping
   down to floor-level again. "I've got one friend for you
   definite, but to be honest with you he's only so-so. I've
   got call-backs coming on two others, so let's see what
   they're like before you commit on the definite. Okay?"
  "Ummm ... I think there's some kind of mistake
   here," I said desperately, trying to stop the madness
   before it progressed any further. "I'm not trying to find
   a new friend. I'm trying to locate a friend I already have
   who may be here in town.''
  He blinked several times as this news sank in. He
   started to turn back to his phones in an involuntary mo-
   tion, then waved a hand at them in disgusted dismissal.
  "Heck with it," he said with a sigh. "If they can
   come up with anything, I can always fob 'em off on
   someone else for a profit. Now then, let's try this again.
   You're looking for someone specific. Are they a townie
   or a transient? It would help if you gave me a little
   something to go on, you know."
  He seemed a little annoyed, and I would have liked to
   do or say something to cheer him up. Before I could
   think of anything, however, my apprentice decided to
   join the conversation.
  "This is quite a layout you've got, Fast Worker.
  MYTH-ING PERSONS           55
  Mind if I ask exactly what it is you do?"
  As always, Massha's "people sense" proved to be
   better than mine. The little vampire brightened notice-
   ably at the compliment, and his chest puffed out as he
   launched into his narration.
  "Well, the job was originally billed as Dispatcher...
   you know, as in Dispatcher of Nightmares. But anyway,
   like any job, it turned out to involve a lot of things that
   aren't on the job description. Now it's sort of a com-
   bination of dispatcher, travel agent, lost and found, and
   missing persons bureau."
  "Nightmares?" I questioned, unable to contain my-
   self.
  "Sure. Anything that comes out of Limbo, be it
   dreams or the real thing, comes through here. Where're
   you from that you didn't know that?"
  Obviously, I wasn't wild about continuing on the sub-
   ject of our place of origin.
  "Ahhh, can you really help us find our friend? He's
   new in town, like us."
  "That's right. You're looking for someone. Sorry. I
   get a little carried away sometimes when I talk about my
   work. New in town, hmmm? Shouldn't be that hard to
   locate. We don't get that many visitors."
  "He might be in jail," Massha blurted out before I
   realized what she was going to say.
  "In jail?" The vampire frowned. "The only outsider
   in jail right now is. ... Say! Now I recognize you! The
   eyes threw me for a minute. You're Skeeve, aren't
   you?"
  "Screen 97B!" he declared proudly, gesturing
   vaguely over his shoulder. "There's someone a dozen
   dimensions over from here, runs a hot dog stand, who
   features you in his most frequent nightmares. You, a
   dragon, and a Pervert. Am I correct in assuming that
  56 Robert Asprin
  the current resident in our fair jail is none other than
   your sidekick Aahz?"
  "To be correct, that's Pervect, not Pervert... but ex-
   cept for that you're right. That's my partner you've got
   locked up there, and we aim to get him out."
  I was probably talking too much, but being recog-
   nized in a dimension I'd never heard of had thrown me
   off balance. Then again, the Dispatcher didn't seem all
   that hostile at the discovery. More curious than any-
   thing else.
  "Well, well. Skeeve himself. I never expected to meet
   you in person. Sometime you must tell me what you did
   to that poor fellow to rate the number-one slot on his hit
   parade of nightmares."
  "What about Aahz?'' I said impatiently.
  "You know he's up for murder, don't you?"
  "Heard it. Don't believe it. He's a lot of things, but a
   murderer isn't one of them."
  "There's a fair amount of evidence." Vilhelm
   shrugged. "But tell me. What's with the vampire get-
   up. You're no more a vampire than I'm a Klahd."
  "It's a long story. Let's just say it seemed to be the
   local uniform."
  "Let's not," the dispatcher grinned. "Pull up a chair
   ... free of charge, of course. I've got time and lots of
   questions about the other dimensions. Maybe we can
   trade a little information while you're here."
   

   




Chapter Seven:



   

   "I don't see anything thrilling about it!""
  —M. JACKSON
  "I really don't see how you can drink that stuff," I de-
   clared, eyeing Vilhelm's goblet of blood.
  "Funny," he smiled in return, "I was about to say
   the same thing. I mean, you know what W. C. Fields
   said about water!"
  "No. What?"
  "Now let me get this straight," Guido interrupted
   before I could get any answer. "You're sayin' you vam-
   pire guys don't really drink blood from people?"
  "Oh, a few do," the Dispatcher said with a shrug.
   "But it's an acquired taste, like steak tartare. Some say
   it's a gourmet dish, but I could never stand the stuff
   myself. I'll stick with the inexpensive domestic varieties
   any night."
  We were all sprawled around the Dispatcher's office
   at this point, sipping our respective drinks and getting
   into a pretty good rap session. We had pulled Guido in
   off door watch and I had dropped our disguises so my
  57
   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   58 Robert Asprin MYTH-ING PERSONS 59
  energy reserve wasn't being drained.
  The Dispatcher had played with his phones, calling
   from one to the other. Then he put them all down and
   announced that he had them on "hold," a curious ex-
   pression since it was the first time in half an hour he
   hadn't been holding one.
  Vilhelm himself was turning out to be a priceless
   source of information, and, as promised, had a seem-
   ingly insatiable curiosity about otherworldly things.
  "Then how do you account for all the vampire leg-
   ends around the other dimensions," Massha said skepti-
   cally.
  The Dispatcher made a face.
  "First of all, you've got to realize who you're dealing
   with. Most of the ones who do extensive touring outside
   of Limbo are 'old money' types. We're talking about
   the idle rich ... and that usually equates to bored thrill-
   seekers. Working stiffs like me can't afford to take that
   kind of time away from our jobs. Heck, I can hardly
   manage to get my two weeks each year. Anyway, there
   are a lot more of us around the dimensions than you
   might realize. It's just that the level-headed ones are
   content to maintain a low profile and blend with the
   natives. They content themselves with the blood of do-
   mestic livestock, much the way we do here at home. It's
   the others that cause the problems. Like any group of
   tourists, there's always a few who feel that just because
   they're in another world or city, the rules don't apply
   ... and that includes common manners and good taste.
   They're the ones who stir up trouble by getting the lo-
   cals up in arms about 'bloodsucking monsters.' If it
   makes you feel any better, you human types have a
   pretty bad rep yourselves here in Limbo."
  That caught my attention.
  "Could you elaborate on that last point, Vilhelm?
  What problem could the locals have with us?"
  The Dispatcher laughed.
  "The same one you humans have with us vampires.
   While humans aren't the leading cause of death in vam-
   pires any more than vampires are a leading cause of
   death in humans, it's certainly one of the more publi-
   cized and sensational ways to go."
  "Is that why the first locals we met took off like bats
   out of hell... if you'll pardon the expression?" Massha
   asked.
  "You've got it. I think you'll find that the citizens of
   Blut will react the same way to you that you would if
   you ran into a vampire in your home dimension."
  "I don't notice you bein' particularly scared of us,"
   Guido said suspiciously.
  "One of the few advantages of this job. After a few
   years of. monitoring the other dimensions, you get pretty
   blase about demons. As far as I can tell, most of 'em are
   no worse than some of the folks we've got around
   here."
  This was all very interesting, but I was getting a little
   fidgety about our mission.
  "Since you know we aren't all evil or on a permanent
   vampire hunt, what can you tell us about the mess Aahz
   is in? Can you give us any help there?"
  "I dunno," the Dispatcher said, rubbing his jaw
   thoughtfully. "Until I found out who he was, I was
   ready to believe he was guilty as sin. There's an awful
   lot of evidence against him."
  "Such as?" I pressed.
  "Well, he was caught with a stake and mallet in his
   hand, and there are two eyewitnesses who say they saw
   him kill one of our citizens and scatter his dust to the
   winds."
  "Wait a minute. You mean you ain't got no corpus

  Robert Asprin
  delecti?" Guido said, straightening in his chair. "Sorry
   to interrupt. Boss, but you're playin* in my alley now.
   This is somethin' I know a little about. You can't go on
   trial for murder without a corpse, know what I mean?"
  "Maybe where you come from," Vilhelm corrected,
   "but things get a little different when you're dealing
   with vampires. If we had a body, or even just the pile of
   dust, we could revive him in no time flat. As it is, the
   problem is when there's no body... when a vampire's
   been reduced to dust and the dust scattered. That's
   when it's impossible to pull 'em back into a functional
  mode."
  "But if there isn't a body, how do you know the vic-
   tim is dead at all? " I asked.
  "There's the rub," Vilhelm agreed. "But in this case,
  there's a matter of two eyewitnesses."
  "Two of 'em, eh?" Massha murmured thoughtfully.
   "Would you happen to have descriptions of these two
  peepers?"
  "Saw 'em myself. They were both off-worlders like
   yourselves. One was a young girl, the blonde and inno-
   cent type. The other was a pretty sleazy-looking guy. It
   was her who sold us on the story, really. I don't think
   anyone would have believed him if he said that were-
  wolves were furry."
  My heart sank. I had wanted very badly to believe the
   girl who had warned us of Aahz's danger was somehow
   an innocent bystander in the proceedings. Now it looked
  as if....
  "Do the descriptions sound familiar, Hot Stuff? Still
  think Guido and I were being paranoid when we said
   this might be a set-up? Sounds like they framed your
   partner, then came back after you to complete the set."
   I avoided her eyes, staring hard at the wall monitors.
  "There might be another explanation, you know."
  My apprentice gave out a bark of laughter.
  "If there is, I'm dying to hear it. Face it, High Roller,
   any way you look at it the situation stinks. If they
   cooked up a frame that tight on Green and Scaly on
   such short notice, I'm dying to see what kind of a trap
   they've got waiting for you now that they've had time to
   get ready before inviting you to step in."
  It occurred to me that I had never been that mouthy
   when I was an apprentice. It also occurred to me that
   now I understood why Aahz had gotten so angry on the
   rare occasions when I had voiced an opinion ... and the
   rarer times when I was right.
  "I think I missed a lap in this conversation some-
   where." Vilhelm frowned. "I take it you know the wit-
   nesses?"
  Massha proceeded to bring the Dispatcher up to date,
   with Guido growling counterpoint to the theme. For
   once I was glad to let them do the talking. It gave me a
   chance to collect my scattered thoughts and try to for-
   mulate a plan. When they finished, I still had a long way
   to go on both counts.
  "I must admit, viewed from the light of this new in-
   formation, the whole thing does sound a little suspi-
   cious," the vampire said thoughtfully.
  "A little suspicious!" Massha snorted. "It's phonier
   than a smiling Deveel!"
  "Tell ya what," Guido began, "just give us a few
   minutes alone with these witnesses of yours and we'll
   shake the truth out of'em."
  "I'm afraid that will be a little difficult," the Dis-
   patcher said, eyeing the ceiling. "You see, they haven't
   been around for a while. Disappeared right after the
   trial."
   

   

   

   

   62 Robert Asprin
  "The trial!?" I snapped, abandoning my efforts to
   collect my wits. "You mean the trial's already been
   held?"
  The vampire nodded.
  "That's right. Needless to say, your friend was found
   guilty."
  "Why do I get the feeling he didn't get a suspended
   sentence for a first offense?" Guido growled under his
   breath.
  "As a matter of fact, he's been slated for execution at
   the end of the week," Vilhelm admitted.
  That got me out of my seat and pacing.
  "We've got to do something," I said needlessly.
   "How about it, Vilhelm? Can you help us out at all?
   Any chance of getting the verdict reversed or at least a
   stay of execution?"
  "I'm afraid not. Character witnesses alone wouldn't
   change anything, and as for new evidence, it would only
   be your word against the existing witnesses... and
   you've already admitted the defendant is a friend of
   yours. Mind you, / believe you, but there are those who
   would suspect you'd say anything or fabricate any kind
   of tale tosave your partner."
  "But can you personally give us a hand?"
  "No, I can't," the vampire said, turning away. "You
   all seem like real nice folks, and your friend is probably
   the salt of the earth, but I have to live here and deal with
   these people for a long time. If I sided with outsiders
   against the town legal system, my whole career would
   go down the drain whether I was right or not. It's not
   pretty and I don't like it, but that's the way things are."
  "We could fix it so you like it a lot less!" Guido said
   darkly, reaching into his coat.
  "Stop it, Guido," I ordered. "Let's not forget the
   help Vilhelm's already given us. It's a lot more than we
   

   

   

   

   MYTH-ING PERSONS           63
  expected to get when we first came into this dimension,
   so don't go making enemies out of the only friend we*ve
   got locally. Okay?"
  The bodyguard sank back into his chair, muttering
   something I was just as glad I didn't hear, but his hand
   came out of his coat empty and stayed in sight.
  "So what do we do now. Hot Stuff?" Massha sighed.
  "The only thing I can think of is to try to locate those
   witnesses before the execution date," I said. "What I
   can't figure is how to go about looking without getting
   half the town down on our necks."
  "What we really need is a bloodhound," Guido
   grumbled.
  "Say, that's not a bad idea!" Vilhelm exclaimed,
   coming to life. "Maybe I can help you after all!"
  "You got a bloodhound?" the bodyguard said, rais-
   ing his eyebrows.
  "Even better," the vampire declared. "I don't know
   why I didn't think of it before. The ones you need to get
   in touch with are the Woof Writers."
  I studied him-carefully to see if this were some kind of
   joke.
  "The Woof Writers?" I repeated at last.
  "Well, that's what we in Blut call them behind their
   backs. Actually, they're a husband-wife team of were-
   wolves who are on a big crusade to raise sympathy for
   humans."
  "Werewolves," I said carefully.
  "Sure. We got all kinds here in Limbo. Anyway, if
   anyone in this dimension will be willing to stick their
   necks out for you, they're the ones. They do their own
   thing and don't really give a hang what any of the other
   locals think about it. Besides, werewolves are second to
   none when it comes to sniffing out a trail."
  "Werewolves."
   

   

   

   

   64 Robert Asprin
  Vilhelmcocked his head at me curiously.
  "Am I imagining things, Skeeve, or didn't you just
   say that?"
  "What's more," Massha smiled sweetly, "he'll prob-
   ably say it again. It bears repeating."
  "Werewolves," I said again, just to support my ap-
   prentice.
  "Boss," Guido began, "I don't want to say this, but
   nobody said anything about werewolves when we...."
  "Good," I interrupted brusquely. "You don't want
   to say it, and I don't want to hear it. Now that we're in
   agreement, let's just pass on it and...."
  "But Boss! We can't team up with werewolves."
  "Guido, we just went over this. We're in a tight spot
   and in a strange dimension. We can't afford to be
   choosy about our allies."
  "You don't understand. Boss. I'm allergic to 'em!"
  I sank down into a chair and hid my face in my hands.
  "I thought you were allergic to garlic," I said through
   my fingers.
  "That. too," the bodyguard said. "But mostly I'm
   allergic to furry things like kitties or fur coats or...."
  "... or werewolves," Massha finished for him.
   "Frankly, Dark and Deadly, one starts to wonder how
   you've been able to function effectively all these years."
  "Hey, it doesn't come up all that often, know what I
   mean?" Guido argued defensively. "How many times
   have .you been attacked by somethin' furry?"
  "Not as often as I'd like!" Massha leered.
  "Enough, you two," I ordered, raising my head.
   "Guido, have you ever actually been near a werewolf?"
  "Well, no. But...."
  "Then until we know for sure, we'll assume you're
   not allergic to them. Okay? Vilhelm, exactly where do
   we find these Woof Writers of yours?"
   

   




Chapter Eight:



   

   "First, let's decide who's leading and
   who's following."
  —F. ASTAIRE
  "BOSS, just where the hell is Pahkipsee?"
  I found myself wondering if all bodyguards spent
   most of their time complaining, or if I had just gotten
   lucky.
  "Look, Guido. You were there and heard the same
   instructions I did. If Vilhelm was right, it should be just
   up the road here a couple more miles."
  "... 'a rather dead bedroom community, fit only for
   those not up to the fast-lane life-style of the big city,' "
   Massha quoted in a close imitation of the vampire's
   voice.
  Guido snickered rudely.
  "Why do I get the feeling you didn't particularly
   warm to Vilhelm, Massha?" I suppressed a grin of my
   own.
  "Maybe it's because he's the only guy we've met she
   hasn't made a pass at?" Guido suggested.
  Massha favored him with an extended tongue and
  65
   

   

   

   

   66 Robert Asprin
  crossed eyes before answering.
  "Oh, Vilhelm's okay," she said. "Kinda cute, too
   ... at least the top of his head was. And he did admit
   that in general vampires were more partial to cities and
   parties while werewolves preferred the back-to-nature
   atmosphere of rural living. I just didn't like the crack,
   that's all. I grew up on a farm, you know. Country
   breakfasts have a lot to do with my current panoramic
   physique. Besides, something inside says you shouldn't
   trust a smiling vampire. ... or at least you shouldn't
   trust him too far."
  I had been about to mention the fact that I had grown
   up on a farm, too, but withheld the information. Obvi-
   ously, farm food hadn't particularly affected my phy-
   sique, and I didn't want to rob my apprentice of her
   excuse.
  "If he had wanted to do us harm, all he would have
   had to do was blow the whistle on us while we were still
   in town," I pointed out. "Let's just take things at face
   value and assume he was really being as nice as he
   seemed ... for all our peace of minds."
  I wished I was as confident as I sounded. We were a
   long way out in the boondocks, and if Vilhelm had
   wanted to send us off on a wild goose chase, he couldn't
   have picked a better direction to start us off in.
  "Yeah, well I'd feel a lot better if we weren't being
   followed," Guido grumbled.
  I stopped in my tracks. So did Massha ... in her
   tracks, that is. The bodyguard managed to stumble into
   us before bringing his own forward progress to a halt.
  "What is it, Boss? Something wrong?"
  "For a minute there, I thought I heard you say that
   we were being followed."
  "Yeah. Since we left the Dispatcher's. Why does. ..
   you mean you didn't know?"
  MYTH-ING PERSONS           67
  I resisted an impulse to throttle him.
  "No, Guido. I didn't know. You see, my bodyguard
   didn't tell me. He was too busy complaining about the
   road conditions to have time to mention anything as
   trivial as someone following us."
  Guido took a few shaky steps backward.
  "Hey! C'mon, Boss. Don't be like that. I thought
   you knew! Honest. Whoever's back there isn't doin'
   such a hot job of hiding the fact that they're dogging
   our trail. Any idiot could've spotted ... I mean...."
  "Keep going, Dark and Deadly," Massha urged.
   "You're digging yourself in further with every word, in
   case you hadn't noticed."
  With great effort I brought myself back under con-
   trol.
  "Whatever," I said. "I don't suppose you have any
   idea who it is?"
  "Naw. There's only one of 'em. Unless...."
  His voice trailed off into silence and he looked sud-
   denly worried.
  "Out with it, Guido. Unless what?"
  "Well, sometimes when you're getting really tricky
   about tailing someone, you put one real clumsy punk
   out front so's they can be spotted while you keep your
   real ace-hitter hidden. I hadn't stopped to think of that
   before. This turkey behind us could be a decoy, know
   what I mean?"
  "I thought you used decoys for ducks, not turkeys,"
   Massha scowled.
  "Well, if that's what's happening, then we're sitting
   ducks, if it makes you feel any better."
  "Could both of you just be quiet for a few minutes
   and let me think?" I said, suddenly impatient with their
   banter.
  "Well, maybe it isn't so bad," Guido said in a doubt-
  68
  MYTH-ING PERSONS           69
  Robert Asprin
  ful voice. "I'm pretty sure I would have spotted the
   back-up team if there was one."
  "Oh sure," Massha sneered. "Coming out of a town
   full of vampires that can change themselves into mist
   whenever they want. Of course you'd spot them."
  "Hey. The Boss here can chew on me if he wants, but
   I don't have to take that from you. You didn't even spot
   the turkey, remember?"
  "The only turkey I can see is... ."
  "Enough!" I ordered, having arrived at a decision
   despite their lack of cooperation. "We have to find out
   for sure who's behind us and what they want. This is as
   good a place as any, so I suggest we all retire into the
   bushes and wait for our shadow to catch up with us. ...
   No, Massha. I'll be over here with Guido. You take the
  other side of the road."
  That portion of my plan had less to do with military
   strategy than with an effort on my part to preserve what
   little was left of my nerves. I figured the only way to
   shut the two of them up was to separate them.
  "I'm sorry, Boss," Guido whispered as we crouched
   side by side in the brush. "I keep forgettin' that you
   aren't as into crime as the boys I usually run with."
  Well, I had been half right. Massha on the other side
   of the road was being quiet, but as long as he had some-
   one to talk to, Guido was going to keep on expressing
   his thoughts and opinions. I was starting to understand
   why Don Bruce insisted on doing all the talking when
   the bodyguards were around. Encouraging employees to
   speak up as equals definitely had its drawbacks.
  "Will you keep your voice down?" I tried once more.
   "This is supposed to be an ambush."
  "Don't worry about that. Boss. It'll be a while be-
   fore they catch up, and when they do, I'll hear 'em be-
   fore. ..."
  "Isthatyou.Skeeve?"
  The voice came from the darkness just up the road.
  I gave Guido my darkest glare, and he rewarded it
   with an apologetic shrug that didn't look particularly
   sincere to me.
  Then it dawned on me where I had heard that voice
   before.
  "Right here," I said, rising from my crouch and step-
   ping onto the road. "We've been waiting for you. I
   think it's about time we had a little chat."
  Aside from covering my embarrassment over having
   been discovered, that had to be my best understatement
   in quite a while. The last time I had seen this particular
   person, she was warning me about Aahz's imprison-
   ment.
  "Good." She stepped forward to meet me. "That's
   why I've been following you. I was hoping we
   could...."
  Her words stopped abruptly as Guido and Massha
   rose from the bushes and moved to join us.
  "Well, look who's here," Massha said, flashing one
   of her less pleasant smiles.
  "If it isn't the little bird who sang to the vampires,"
   Guido leered, matching my apprentice's threatening
   tone.
  The girl favored them with a withering glance, then
   faced me again.
  "I was hoping we could talk alone. I've got a lot to
   say and not much time to say it. It would go faster if we
   weren't interrupted."
  "Not a chance, Sweetheart," Guido snarled. "I'm
   not goin' to let the Boss out of my sight with you
   around."
  "... besides which, I've got a few things to tell you
   myself," Massha added, "like what I think of folks who
   

   

   

   

   70
  Robert Asprin MYTH-ING PERSONS 71
  think frames look better on people than on paintings."
  The girl's eyes never left mine. For all her bravado, I
   thought I could detect in their depths an appeal for help.
  "Please," she said softly.
  I fought a brief skirmish in my mind, and, as usual,
   common sense lost.
  "All right."
  "WHAT! C'mon, Boss. You can't let her get you
   alone! If her pals are around...."
  "Hot Stuff, if I have to sit on you. you aren't going
  to...."
  "Look!" I said, wrenching my eyes away from the
   girl to confront my mutinous staff. "We'll only go a
   few steps down the road there, in plain sight. If any-
   thing happens you'll be able to pitch in before it gets
   serious."
  "But...."
  "... and you certainly can't think she's going to
   jump me. I mean, it's a cinch she isn't carrying any con-
   cealed weapons."
  That was a fact. She had changed outfits since the last
   time I saw her, probably to fit in more with the exotic
   garb favored by the party-loving vampires. She was
   wearing what I've heard referred to as a "tank top"
   which left her midsection and navel delightfully ex-
   posed, and the open-sided skirt (if you can call two flaps
   of cloth that) showed her legs up past her hips. If she
   had a weapon with her, she had swallowed it. Either
   that, or....
  I dragged my thoughts back to the argument.
  "The fact of the matter is that she isn't going to talk
   in front of a crowd. Now, am I going to get a chance to
   hear another viewpoint about what's going on, or are
   we going to keep groping around for information with
   Aahz's life hanging in the balance?"
  My staff fell silent and exchanged glances, each wait-
   ing for the other to risk the next blast.
  "Well, okay," Massha agreed at last. "But watch
   yourself, Hot Stuff. Remember, poison can come in
   pretty bottles."
  So, under the ever-watchful glares of my assistants, I
   retired a few steps down the road for my first words
   alone with....
  "Say, what is your name, anyway?"
  "Hmmm? Oh. I'm Luanna. Say, thanks for backing
   me up. That's a pretty mean-looking crew you hang
   around with. I had heard you had a following, but I
   hadn't realized how nasty they were."
  "Oh, they're okay once you get to know them. If you
   worked with them on a day-to-day basis, you'd find out
   that they... heck, none of us are really as dangerous or
   effective as the publicity hype cuts us out to be."
  I was suddenly aware of her eyes on me. Her expres-
   sion was strange ... sort of a bitter half-smile.
  "I've always heard that really powerful people tended
   to understate what they can do, that they don't have to
   brag. I never really believed it until now."
  I really didn't know what to say to that. I mean, my
   reputation had gotten big enough that I was starting to
   get used to being recognized and talked about at the
   Bazaar, but what she was displaying was neither fear
   nor envy. Among my own set of friends, admiration or
   praise was always carefully hidden within our own
   brand of rough humor or teasing. Faced with the undi-
   luted form of the same thing, I was at a loss as to how to
   respond.
  "Ummm, what was it you wanted to talk to me
   about?"
  Her expression fell and she dropped her eyes.
  "This is so embarrassing. Please be patient with me,
   

   

   

   

   72              Robert Asprin
  MYTH-ING PERSONS
  73
  Skeeve ... is it all right if I call you Skeeve? I haven't
   had much experience with saying 'I'm sorry'... heck, I
   haven't had much experience with people at all. Just
   partners and pigeons. Now that I'm here, I really don't
   know what to say."
  "Why don't we start at the beginning?" I wanted to
   ease her discomfort. "Did you really swindle the
   Deveels back at the Bazaar?"
  Luanna nodded slowly without raising her eyes.
  "That's what we do. Matt and me. That and running,
   even though I think sometimes we're better at running
   than working scams. Maybe if we were better at conning
   people, we wouldn't get so much practice at running."
  Her words thudded at me like a padded hammer. I
   had wanted very badly to hear that she was innocent and
   that it had all been a mistake. I mean, she was so pretty,
   so sweet, I would have bet my life that she was innocent,
   yet here she was openly admitting her guilt to me.
  "But why?" I managed at last. "I mean, how did you
   get involved in swindling people to begin with?"
  Her soft shoulders rose and fell in a helpless shrug.
  "I don't know. It seemed like a good idea when Matt
   first explained it to me. I was dying to get away from the
   farm, but I didn't know how to do anything but farm-
   work for a living... until Matt explained to me how
   easy it was to get money away from people by playing
   on their greed. 'Promise them something for nothing,'
   he said, 'or for so little that they think they're swindling
   you.' When he put it that way, it didn't seem so bad. It
   was more a matter of being smart enough to trick people
   who thought they were taking advantage of you."
  "... by selling them magical items that weren't." I
   finished for her. "Tell me, why didn't you just go into
   the magic trade for real?"
  Her head came up, and I caught a quick flash of fire
   in her sad blue eyes.
  "We didn't know any magic, so we had to fake it.
   You probably can't understand that, since you're the
   real McCoy. I knew that the first time I saw you at Pos-
   sletum. We were going to try to fake our way into the
   Court Magician spot until you showed up and flashed a
   bit of real magic at the crown. Even Matt had to admit
   that we were outclassed, and we kind of faded back be-
   fore anyone asked us to show what we could do. I think
   it was then that I...."
  She broke off, giving me a startled, guilty look as if
   she had been about to say something she shouldn't.
  "Go on," I urged, my curiosity piqued.
  "It's nothing, really," she said hastily. "Now it's
   your turn. Since I've told you my story, maybe you
   won't mind me asking how you got started as a magi-
   cian."
  That set me back a bit. Like her, I had been raised on
   a farm. I had run away, though, planning to seek my
   fortune as a master thief, and it was only my chance
   meeting with my old teacher Garkin and eventually
   Aahz that had diverted my career goals toward magic.
   In hindsight, my motives were not discernibly better
   than hers, but I didn't want to admit it just now. I kind
   of liked the way she looked at me while laboring under
   the illusion that I was someone noble and special.
  "That's too long a tale to go into just now," I said
   brusquely. "There are still a few more answers I'd like
   from you. How come you used our place as a getaway
   route f rom Deva?"
  "Oh, that was Vic's idea. We teamed up with him just
   before we started working our con at the Bazaar. When
   it looked like the scam was starting to turn sour, he said
   

   

   

   

   74 Robert Asprin MYTH-ING PERSONS 75
  he knew a way-off dimension that no one would be
   watching. Matt and I didn't even know it was your place
   until your doorman asked if we were there to see you.
   Matt was so scared about having to tangle with you that
   he wanted to forget the whole thing and find another
   way out, but Vic showed us the door and it looked so
   easy we just went along with him."
  "Of course, it never occurred to you that we'd get
   stuck with the job of trying to bring you back."
  "You better believe it occurred to us. I mean, we
   didn't think you'd have to do it. We expected you'd be
   mad at us for getting you involved and come after us
   yourself. Vic kept saying that we shouldn't worry, that
   if you found us here in Limbo he could fix it so you
   wouldn't be able to take us back. I didn't know he was
   thinking about setting up a frame until he sprang it on
   your partner."
  I tried to let this console me, but it didn't work.
  "I notice that once you found out that Aahz was
   being framed, you still went along with it."
  "Well... I didn't want to, but Vic kept saying that if
   you two were as good as everyone said, that your
   partner could get out of jail by himself. We figured that
   he'd escape before the execution, but with the whole
   dimension hunting him as a fugitive that he'd be too
   busy running for home to bother about catching us."
  I was starting to get real anxious to meet this guy Vic.
   It also occurred to me that of all the potential problems
   our growing reputation could bring down on us, this
   was one we had never expected.
  "And you believed him?"
  Luanna made a face, then shrugged.
  "Well... you're supposed to be able to do some
   pretty incredible things, and I don't want you to think I
   don't believe in your abilities, but I was worried enough
  that I sneaked back to let you know what was going on
   .. .just in case."
  It was almost funny that she was apologizing for giv-
   ing us the warning. Almost, but not quite. My mind
   kept running over what might have happened if she had
   believed in me completely.
  "I guess my only other question is who is this citizen
   that Aahz is supposed to have killed?"
  "Didn't anybody tell you?" she blinked. "It's Vic.
   He's from this dimension... you know, a vampire.
   Anyway, he's hiding out until the whole thing's resolved
   one way or another. I don't think even Matt knows
   where he is. Vampires are normally suspicious, and
   after I sneaked out the first time, he's even gotten cagey
   around us. He just drops in from time to time to see
   how we're doing."
  Now I knew I wanted to meet friend Vic. If I was
   lucky, I'd meet him before Aahz did.
  "Well, I do appreciate you filling me in on the prob-
   lem. Now, if you'll just come back to Blut with us and
   explain things to the authorities, my gratitude will be
   complete."
  Luanna started as if I had stuck her with a pin.
  "Hold on a minute! Who said anything about going
   to the authorities? I can't do that! That would be dou-
   blecrossing my partners. I don't want to see you or your
   friends get hurt, but I can't sacrifice my own to save
   them."
  An honest crook is both incongruous and infuriating.
   Aahz had often pointed this out to me when some point
   in my ethic kept me from going along with one of his
   schemes, and now I was starting to understand what he
   was talking about.
  "But then why are you here?"
  "I wanted to warn you. Vic has been thinking that
   

   

   

   

   76 Robert Asprin MYTH-ING PERSONS 77
  you might come into Limbo after your partner, and he's
   setting up some kind of trap if you did. If he was right,
   I thought you should know that you're walking into
   trouble. I figured that if you came, you'd look up the
   Dispatcher, so I waited there and followed you when
   you showed up. I just wanted to warn you is all. That
   and...."
  She dropped her eyes again and lowered her voice
   until I could hardly hear her.
  "... I wanted to see you again. I know it's silly,
   but...."
  As flattering as it was, this time I was unimpressed.
  "Yeah, sure." I interrupted. "You're so interested in
   me you're willing to let my partner sit on a murder rap
   just so you can watch me go through my paces."
  "I already explained about that," she said fiercely,
   stepping forward to lay a hand on my arm.
  I stared at it pointedly until she removed it.
  "Well," she said in a small voice. "I can see that
   there's nothing more I can say. But, Skeeve? Promise
   me that you won't follow me when I leave? You or your
   friends? I took a big risk finding you. Please don't make
   me regret it."
  I stared at her for a long moment, then looked away
   and nodded.
  "I know you're disappointed in me, Skeeve," came
   her voice, "but I can't go against my partners. Haven't
   "you ever had to do something you didn't want to do to
   support your partner?"
  That hit home ... painfully.
  "Yes, I have," I said, drawing a ragged breath. "I'm
   sorry, Luanna. I'm just Worried about Aahz, that's all.
   Tell you what. Just to show there're no hard feelings,
   can I have a token or something? Something to remem-
   ber you by until I see you again?"
  She hesitated, then pulled a gossamer-thin scarf from
   somewhere inside her outfit. Stepping close, she tucked
   it into my tunic, then rose on her tiptoes and kissed me
   softly.
  "It's nice of you to ask," she said. "Even if I don't
   mean anything to you at all, it's nice of you to ask."
  With that, she turned and sprinted off down the road
   into the darkness.
  I stared after her.
  "You're letting her go!?"
  Suddenly Massha was at my side, flanked by Guido.
  "C'mon, Boss. We gotta catch her. She's your
   partner's ticket off death row. Where's she goin'?"
  "To meet up with her partners in crime," I said.
   "Including a surprisingly lively guy named Vic ...
   surprising since he's the one that Aahz is supposed to
   have killed."
  "So we can catch 'em all together. Nice work, Hot
   Stuff. Okay, let's follow her and...."
  "No!"
  "Why not?"
  "Because I promised her."
  There was a deathly silence as my assistants digested
   this information.
  "So she walks and Green and Scaly dies, is that it?"
  "You're sellin' out your partner for a skirt? That
   musta been some kiss."
  I slowly turned to face them, and, mad as they were,
   they fell silent.
  "Now listen close," I said quietly, "because I'm not
   going to go over it again. If we tried to follow her back
   to their hideout, and she spotted us, she'd lead us on a
   wild goose chase and we'd never catch up with them ...
   and we need that so-called corpse. I don't think her
   testimony alone will swing the verdict."

  "But Boss, if we let her get away...."
   "We'll find them," I said. "Without us dogging her
   footsteps, she'll head right back to her partners."
  "But how will we...."
  In answer, I pulled Luanna's scarf from my tunic.
   "Fortunately, she was kind enough to provide us with
   a means to track her, once we recruit the necessary were-
  wolf."
  Guido gave my back a slap that almost staggered me.
   "Way to go, Boss," he crowed. "You really had me
  goin' for a minute. I thought that chickie had really
  snowed you."
  I looked up to find Massha eyeing me suspiciously.
   "That was quite a kiss. Hot Stuff," she said. "If I
   didn't know better, I'd think that young lady is more
   than a little stuck on you... and you just took
  advantage of it."
   I averted my eyes, and found myself staring down the
  road again.
  "As a wise woman once told me," I said, "sometimes
   you have to do things you don't like to support your
   partner. ... Now, let's go find these Woof Writers."
   

   




Chapter Nine:



   

   "My colleagues and I feel that independ-
   ents like ElfQuest are nothing but sheep in
   wolves' clothing!"
  -S.LEE
  THE Woof Writers turned out to be much more pleas-
   ant than I had dared hope, which was fortunate as my
   werewolf disguises were some of the shakiest I'd ever
   done. Guido was indeed allergic to werewolves as feared
   (he started sneezing a hundred yards from their house)
   and was waiting outside, but even trying to maintain
   two disguises was proving to be a strain on my powers in
   this magic-poor dimension. I attempted to lessen the
   drain by keeping the changes minimal, but only suc-
   ceeded in making them incredibly unconvincing even
   though my assistants assured me they were fine. No
   matter what anyone tells you, believe, me, pointy ears
   alone do not wolf make.
  You might wonder why I bothered with diguises at
   all? Well, frankly, we were getting a little nervous.
   Everyone we had talked to or been referred to in this
   dimension was so nice\ We kept waiting for the other
   shoe to drop. All of our talks and discussions of pos-
  80 Robert Asprin
  sible traps had made us so skittish that we were now
   convinced that there was going to be a double-cross
   somewhere along the way. The only question in our
   minds was when and by whom.
  With that in mind, we decided it would be best to try
   to pass ourselves off as werewolves until we knew for
   sure the Woof Writers were as well-disposed toward
   humans as Vilhelm said they were. The theory was that
   if they weren't, the disguises might give us a chance to
   get out again before our true nature was exposed. The
   only difficulty with that plan was that I had never seen a
   werewolf in my life, so not only was I working with a
   shortage-of energy, I was unsure as to what the final
   result should look like. As it turned out, despite their
   knowledgeable advice, my staff didn't know either.
  While we're answering questions from the audience,
   you might ask, if neither I nor my assistants knew what
   a werewolf looked like, how I knew the disguises were
   inadequate? Simple. I deduced the fact after one look at
   real werewolves. That and the Woof Writers told me so.
   Didn't I tell you they were great folks? Of course, they
   let us sweat for a while before admitting that they knew
   we were poorly disguised humans all along, but I myself
   tend to credit that to their dubious sense of humor. It's
   Massha who insists it was blatant sadism. Of course, she
   was the one who had to eat a bone before they acknowl-
   edged the joke.
  Anyway, I was talking about the Woof Writers. It
   was interesting in that I had never had much opportu-
   nity to watch a husband-wife team in action before (my
   parents don't count). The closest thing to the phenom-
   enon I had witnessed was the brother-sister team of
   Tananda and Chumley, but they spent most of their
   conversational time trying to "one-down" each other.
  MYTH-ING PERSONS           81
  The Woof Writers, in contrast, seemed to take turns
   playing "crazy partner-sane partner." They never asked
   my opinion, but I felt that she was much better at play-
   ing the crazy than he. He was so good at playing the
   straight that when he did slip into crazy mode. it always
   came as a surprise.
  "Really, dear," Idnew was saying to Massha,
   "wouldn't you like to slip out of that ridiculous disguise
   into something more comfortable? A werewolf with
   only two breasts looks so silly."
  "Idnew," her husband said sternly, "you're making
   our guests uncomfortable. Not everyone feels as easy
   about discussing their bodies as you do."
  "It's the artist in me," she returned, "And besides,
   Drahcir, who was it that set her up to eat a bone?—and
   an old one at that. If you were a little more conscien-
   tious when you did the shopping instead of stocking up
   on junk food...."
  "Oh, don't worry about me. Hairy and Handsome,"
   Massha interceded smoothly, dropping into her vamp
   role. "I've got no problems discussing my body, as long
   as we get equal time to talk about yours. I've always
   liked my men with a lot of facial hair, if you get my
   drift."
  I noticed Idnew's ears flatten for a moment before
   returning to their normal upright position. While it may
   have been nothing more than a nervous twitch, it oc-
   curred to me that if we were going to solicit help from
   these two, it might not be wise to fan any embers of
   jealousy that might be lying about.
  "Tell me," I said hastily, eager to get the subject
   away from Massha's obvious admiration of Drahcir,
   "What got you started campaigning for better relation-
   ships between humans and werewolves?"
  82 Robert Asprin
  "Well, there were many factors involved," Drahcir
   explained, dropping into the lecturer mode I had grown
   to know so well in such a short time. "I think the most
   important thing to keep in mind is that the bad reputa-
   tion humans have is vastly overrated. There is actually
   very little documented evidence to support the legends
   of human misconduct. For the most part, werewolves
   tend to forget that, under the proper conditions, we turn
   into humans. Most of them are afraid or embarrassed
   and hide themselves away until it passes, but Idnew and
   I don't. If anything we generally seize the opportunity
   to go out and about and get the public used to seeing
   harmless humans in their midst. Just between us,
   though, I think Idnew here likes to do it because it
   scares the hell out of folks to be suddenly confronted by
   a human when they aren't expecting it. In case you
   haven't noticed, there's a strong exhibitionist streak in
   my wife. For myself, it's simply a worthy cause that's
   been neglected for far too long."
  "The other factor, which my husband has neglected
   to mention," Idnew put in impishly, "is that there's a
   lot of money in it."
  "There is? "I asked.
  My work with Aahz had trained me to spot profit op-
   portunities where others saw none, but this time the
   specific angle had eluded me.
  "There... umm ... are certain revenues to be
   gleaned from our campaign," Drahcir said uneasily,
   shooting a dark glance at his wife. "T-shirts, bumper
   stickers, lead miniatures, fan club dues, greeting cards,
   and calendars, just to name a few. It's a dirty job, but
   somebody's got to do it. Lest my wife leave you with the
   wrong impression of me, however, let me point out that
   I'm supporting this particular cause because I really
   believe in it. There are lots of ways to make money."
  MYTH-ING PERSONS           83
  "... and he knows them all, don't you dear?" Idnew
   said with a smile.
  "Really?" I interrupted eagerly. "Would you mind
   running over a few? Could I take notes?"
  "Before you get carried away, High Roller," Massha
   warned, "remember why we came here originally."
  "Oh! Right! Thanks, Massha. For a minute there I
   ... Right!"
  It took me a few seconds to rechannel my thoughts.
   While Aahz's training has gotten me out of a lot of tight
   spots and generally improved my standard of living,
   there are some unfortunate side effects.
  Once I got my mind back on the right track, I quickly
   filled the werewolves in on our current problem. I kept
   the details sketchy, both because I was getting tired of
   going back and forth over the same beginning, and to
   keep from having to elaborate on Luanna's part in caus-
   ing our dilemma. Still, the Woof Writers seemed quite
   enthralled by the tale, and listened attentively until I was
   done.
  "Gee, you're really in a spot," Idnew said when I
   finally ground to a halt. "If there's anything we can do
   to help...."
  "We can't," Drahcir told us firmly. "You're behind
   on your deadlines, Idnew, and I've got three more ap-
   pearances this month... not to mention answering the
   mail that's piled up the last two weekends I've been
   gone."
  "Drahcir...." Idnew said, drawing out his name.
  "Don't look at me like that, dear," her husband
   argued before she had even started her case, "and don't
   cock your head, either. Someone's liable to shove a
   gramophone under it. Remember, you're the one who
   keeps pointing out that we have to put more time into
   our work."
  84
  Robert Asprin
  "I was talking about cutting back on your personal
   appearances," Idnew argued. "Besides, this is impor-
   tant."
  "So's meeting our deadlines. I'm as sympathetic to
   their problem as you are, but we can't let the plight of
   one small group of humans interfere with our work on
   the big picture."
  "But you're the one who insists that deadlines aren't
   as important as...."
  She broke off suddenly and semaphored her ears
  toward her husband.
  "Wait a minute. Any time you start talking about
   'big pictures' and 'grand crusades'... is our bank ac-
   count low again?"
  Drahcir averted his eyes and shifted his feet uncom-
   fortably.
  "Well, I was going to tell you, but I was afraid it
   might distract you while you were trying to work. ..."
  "All right. Let's have it," his wife growled, her
   hackles rising slightly. "What is it you've invested our
   money in this time?''
  I was suddenly very uncomfortable. Our little discus-
   sion seemed to be dissolving into a family fight I felt I
   had no business being present for. Apparently Massha
   felt the same thing.
  "Well, if you can't help us, that's that," she said, get-
   ting to her feet. "No problem. A favor's not a favor if
   you have to be argued into it. C'mon, Hot Stuff. We're
   wasting our time and theirs."
  Though in part I agreed with her, desperation
   prompted me to make one last try.
  "Not so fast, Massha. Drahcir is right. Time's
   money. Maybe we could work out some kind of a fee to
   compensate them for their time in helping us. Then it's
   not a favor, it's a business deal. Face it, we really need
  MYTH-ING PERSONS           85
  their help in this. The odds of us finding this Vic char-
   acter on our own are pretty slim."
  Aahz would have fainted dead away if he had heard
   me admitting how much we needed help before the fee
   was set, but that reaction was nothing compared to how
   the Woof Writers took my offer.
  "What did you say?" Drahcir demanded, rising to all
   fours with his ears back.
  "I said that maybe you'd help us if we offered to pay
   you," I repeated, backing away slightly. "I didn't mean
   to insult you...."
  "You can't insult Drahcir with money," his wife
   snapped. "He meant what did you say about Vic?"
  "Didn't I mention him before?" I frowned. "He's
   the vampire that Aahz is supposed to have...."
  There was a sudden loud flapping sound in the rafters
   above our heads, like someone noisily shaking a news-
   paper to scare a cat off a table. It worked . .. not on the
   cat (I don't think the werewolves owned one) but on
   Massha and me. My apprentice hit the floor, covering
   her head with her hands, while I, more used to sudden
   danger and being more svelte and agile, dove beneath
   the coffee table.
  By the time we recovered from our panicky ... excuse
   me, our shrewd defensive maneuvers, there was nothing
   to see except the vague shape of someone with huge
   wings disappearing out the front door.
  "This one's all yours, dear," Drahcir said firmly, his
   posture erect and unmoved despite the sudden activity.
  "Come on, honey," his wife pleaded. "You're so
   much better at explaining things. You're supposed to
   help me out when it comes to talking to people."
  "It's a skill I polished at those personal appearances
   you're so critical of," he retorted stiffly.
  "Would somebody tell me what's going on?" I said
  86 Robert Asprin MYTH-ING PERSONS 87
  in tones much louder than I usually use when I'm a
   guest in someone's home.
  Before I could get an answer, the door burst open
   again utterly destroying what little was left of my nerv-
   ous system.
  "Hey, Boss! Did you s—se—Wha—wa...."
  "Outside, Guido!" I ordered, glad to have someone I
   could shout at without feeling guilty. "Blow your nose
   ... and I'm fine, thanks! Nice of you to ask!"
  By the time my bodyguard had staggered back out-
   side, his face half buried in a handkerchief, I had man-
   aged to regain most of my composure.
  "Sorry for the interruption," I said as nonchalantly
   as I could, "but my colleague does raise an interesting   !
   question .What was that?''
  "Scary?" Massha suggested.
  Apparently she had recovered her composure a little
   better than I had. I closed my eyes and reflected again
   on the relative value of cheeky apprentices.
  "That," Drahcir said loftily, barely in time to keep
   me from my assistant's throat, "was Vic... one of my
   wife's weird artist friends who dropped in unannounced
   for a prolonged stay and, unless I miss my guess, the
   criminal you're looking for who framed your partner."
  "He wasn't really a friend of mine," Idnew put in in
   a small voice. "Just a friend of a friend, really. Weird
   artist types tend to stick together and pass around the
   locations of crash spaces. He was just another charity
   case down on his luck who...."
  "... who is currently winging his way back to his ac-
   complice with the news that we're on their trail," I
   finished with a grimace.
  "Isn't that 'accomplices' as in plural?" Massha asked
   softly.
  I ignored her.
  "Oh, Drahcir," Idnew said, "now we have to help
   them. It's the only way we can make up for having pro-
   vided a hideout for the very person they were trying to
   find."
  "If I might point out," her husband replied, "we've
   barely met these people. We don't really owe them an
   explanation, much less any help. Besides, you still have
   a deadline to meet and...."
  "Drahcir!" Idnew interrupted. "It could get real
   lonely sleeping in the old kennel while I work day and
   night on a deadline, if you catch my meaning."
  "Now, dear," Drahcir said, sidling up to his wife,
   "before you go getting into a snit, hear me out. I've
   been thinking it over and I think there's a way we can
   provide assistance without biting into our own sched-
   ules. I mean, we do have a friend... one who lives a
   little north of here... who's temporarily between as-
   signments and could use the work. I'm sure he'd be will-
   ing to do a little tracking for them at a fraction of the
   fee that we'd charge for the same service."
  He was obviously talking in the veiled references part-
   ners use to communicate or check ideas in front of
   strangers, as his words went completely over my head,
   but drew an immediate reaction from Idnew.
  "Oh, Drahcir!" she exclaimed excitedly, all trace of
   her earlier anger gone. "That's perfect! And he'll just
   love Massha."
  "There's still the question of whether or not we can
   get him here in time," her husband cautioned. "And of
   course I'll want a percentage off the top as a finder's
   fee...."
  "WHAT! "I exclaimed.
  "I agree," Idnew said firmly. "A finder's fee is to-
   tally. ..."
  "No! Before that," I urged. "What did you say
   

   

   

   

   88 Robert Asprin
  about there not being enough time? I thought the execu-
   tion wasn't scheduled until the end of the week!"
  "That's right," Drahcir said. "But the end of the
   week is tomorrow. Your friend is slated to be executed
   at high midnight."
  "C'mon, Massha," I ordered, heading for the door.
   "We're heading back to Blut."
  "What for?" she demanded. "What can we do with-
   out a tracker?"
  "We've tried being nice about this, and it isn't work-
   ing," I responded grimly. "Now we do it the other way.
   You wanted action, apprentice? How do you feel about
   giving me a hand with a little jailbreak?"
   

   




Chapter Ten:



   

   "What's wrong with a little harmless crime
   once in a while?"
  —M. BLAISE
  "BUT I'm telling you, Boss, jailbreak is a bad rap. With
   you operating at only half power in the magic depart-
   ment, there's no tellin' what can go wrong, and
   then...."
  "Before we get all worked up about what can go
   wrong, Guido," I said, trying to salvage something con-
   structive out of the conversation, "could you give me a
   little information on exactly how hard it is to break
   someone out of jail? Or haven't you been involved in
   any jailbreaks, either?"
  "Of course I've been along on some jailbreaks," the
   bodyguard declared, drawing himself up proudly. "I've
   been an accomplice on three jailbreaks. What kind of
   Mob member do you take me for, anyway?"
  With a heroic effort I resisted the temptation to an-
   swer that particular rhetorical question.
  "Okay. So how about a few pointers? This is my first
   jailbreak, and I want it to go right."
  89
  90 Robert Asprin MYTH-ING PERSONS 91
  I was all set to settle in for a fairly lengthy lecture, but
   instead of launching into the subject, Guido looked a bit
   uncomfortable.
  "Umm... actually, Boss, I don't think you'd want
   to use any of the plans I followed. You see, all three of
   'em were busts. None of 'em worked, and in two of the
   capers, the guy we were tryin' to save got killed. That's
   how I know about what a bad rap a jailbreak is, know
   what I mean?"
  "Oh, swell! Just swell! Tell me. Mister bodyguard,
   with your allergies and zero-for-three record at jail-
   break, did you ever do anything for the Mob that
   worked?"
  A gentle hand fell on my shoulder from behind.
  "Hey! Ease up a little. High Roller," Massha said
   softly. "I know you're worried about your partner, but
   don't take it out on Guido ... or me, either, for that
   matter. We may not be much, but we're here and trying
   to help as best we can when we'd both just as soon be
   bac.k at the Bazaar. You're in a bad enough spot with-
   out starting a two-front war by turning on your allies."
  I started to snap at her, but caught myself in time.
   Instead, I drew a long ragged breath and blew it out
   slowly. She was right. My nerves were stretched to the
   breaking point....hich served me right for not follow-
   ing my own advice.
  We were currently holed up at the Dispatcher's, the
   only place I could think of for an in-town base of
   operations, and as soon as we had arrived, I had insisted
   that both Massha and Guido grab a bit of sleep. We had
   been going nonstop ever since stepping through the door
   into Limbo, and I figured that the troops would need all
   the rest they could get before we tried to spring Aahz.
   Of course, once I had convinced them of the necessity of
   racking out, I promptly ignored my own wisdom and
  stayed up thinking for the duration.
  The rationalization I used for this insane action was
   that I wanted some extra time uninterrupted to recharge
   my internal batteries, so whatever minimal magic I had
   at my disposal would be ready for our efforts. In ac-
   tuality, what I did was worry. While I had indeed taken
   part in several criminal activities since teaming up with
   Aahz, they had all been planned by either Aahz or Tan-
   anda. This was my first time to get involved in master-
   minding a caper, and the stakes were high. Not only
   Aahz's but Massha's and Guide's futures were riding on
   my successful debut, and my confidence level was at an
   all-time low. After much pondering, I had decided to
   swallow my pride and lean heavily on Guide's expertise,
   which was why it hit me so hard when I discovered that
   he knew even less about successful jailbreaks than I.
  "Sorry, Guido," I said, trying to restructure my
   thinking. "I guess I'm more tired than I realized. Didn't
   mean to snap at you."
  "Don't worry. Boss," the bodyguard grinned. "I've
   been expectin' it. All the big operators I've worked with
   get a little crabby when the heat's on. If anything, your
   temper gettin' short is the best thing I've seen since we
   started this caper. That's why I've been so jumpy my-
   self. I wasn't sure if you weren't taking the job seri-
   ously, or if you were just too dumb to know the kind of
   odds we were up against. Now that you're acting normal
   for the situation, I feel a lot better about how it's goin'
   to come out in the end."
  Terrific! Now that I was at the end of my rope, our
   eternal pessimist thought things were going great.
  "Okay," I said, rubbing my forehead with one fin-
   ger, "we haven't got much information to go on, and
   what we do know is bad. According to Vilhelm, Aahz is
   being held in the most escape-proof cell they have,
   

   

   

   

   92 Robert Asprin
  which is the top floor of the highest tower in town. If we
   try to take him from the inside, we're going to have to
   fool or fight every guard on the way up and down. To
   me, that means our best bet is to spring him from the
   outside."
  My assistants nodded vigorously, their faces as en-
   thusiastic as if I had just said something startlingly
   original and clever.
  "Now, with my powers at low ebb. I don't think I can
   levitate that far and spring the cell. Massha, do you
   have anything in your jewelry collection that would
   work for rope and climbing hooks?''
  "N—no," she said hesitantly, which surprised me.
   She usually had a complete inventory of her nasty
   pretties on the tip of her tongue.
  "I saw a coil of rope hangin' just inside the door,"
   Guido supplied.
  "I noticed it, too," I acknowledged, "but it isn't
   nearly long enough. We'll just have to use up my power
   getting up to the cell and figure some other way of
   opening the window."
  "Ummm... you don't have to do that. High
   Roller," Massha said with a sigh. "I've got something
   we can use."
  "What's that?"
  "The belt I'm wearing with all my gear hung on it.
   It's a levitation belt. The controls aren't horribly reli-
   able, but it should do to get us to the top of the tower."
  I cocked an eyebrow at my apprentice.
  "Wait a minute, Massha. Why didn't you mention
   this when I asked?"
  She looked away quickly.
  "You didn't ask about a belt. Only about rope and
   climbing hooks."
  MYTH-ING PERSONS           93
  "Since when do I have to ask you specific questions
   ... or any questions, for that matter, to get your in-
   put?"
  "All right," she sighed. "If you really want to know,
   I was hoping we could find a way to do this without
   using the belt."
  "Why?"
  "It embarrasses me."
  "It what?"
  "It embarrasses me. I look silly floating around in the
   air. It's okay for skinny guys like you and Guido, but
   when I try it, I look like a blimp. All I'd need is Good-
   year tattooed on my side to make the picture complete."
  I closed my eyes and tried to remember that I was
   tired and that I shouldn't take it out on my friends. The
   fact that Massha was worried about appearances while I
   was trying to figure out a way to get us all out of this
   alive wasn't really infuriating. It was... flattering!
   That was it! She was so confident of my abilities to get
   us through this crisis that she had time to think about
   appearances! Of course, the possibility of betraying that
   confidence set me off in another round of worrying.
   Wonderful.
  "You okay. Boss?"
  "Hmmm? Yeah. Sure, Guido. Okay. Now Massha
   floats up to the window, which leaves you and me free
   to...."
  "Hold it, Hot Stuff," Massha said, holding up a
   hand. "I think I'd better explain a little more about this
   belt. I bought it in an 'as-is' rummage sale, and the con-
   trols are not all they should be."
  "How so?"
  "Well, the 'up' control works okay, but the 'altitude'
   is shaky so you're never sure how much you can lift or
  94
  MYTH-ING PERSONS           95
  Robert Asprin
  how high it will go. The real problem, though, is the
   'down' control. There's no tapering-off effect, so it's
   either on or off."
  I was never particularly good at technical jargon, but
   flying was something I knew so I could almost follow
   her.
  "Let me see if I've got this right," I said. "When you
   go up, you aren't sure how much power you'll have, and
   when you land. ..."
  "...it ain't gentle," she finished for me. "Basically,
   you fall from whatever height you're at to the ground."
  "I don't know much about this magic stuff," Guido
   commented dryly, "but that doesn't sound so good.
   Why would you use a rig like that, anyway?"
  "I don't ... at least not for flying," Massha said.
   "Remember, I told you I think it makes me look silly?
   All I use it for is a utility belt... you know, like Bat-
   man? I mean, it's kind of pretty, and it isn't easy to find
   belts in my size."
  "Whatever," I said, breaking into their fashion dis-
   cussion. "We're going to use it tonight to get up to the
   cell even if it means rigging some kind of ballast system.
   Now all we need to figure out is how to open the cell
   window and a getaway plan. Guido, it occurs to me that
   we might pick up a few lessons on jailbreaks from your
   experiences even if they were unsuccessful. I mean,
   negative examples can be as instructive as positive ex-
   amples. So tell me, in your opinion what went wrong in
   the plans you followed in the past?"
  The bodyguard's brow furrowed as it took on the
   unaccustomed exercise of thought.
  "I dunno, Boss. It seems that however much planning
   was done, something always came up that we hadn't
   figured on. If I had to hang our failures on any one
   thing, I'd say it was just that... overplanning. I mean,
  after weeks of lectures and practice sessions, you get a
   little overconfident, so when something goes wrong
   you're caught flatfooted, know what I mean?"
  Nervous as we were, that got a laugh from both
   Massha and me.
  "Well, that's one problem we won't have to worry
   about," I said. "Our planning time is always minimal,
   and for this caper we're going to have to put it together
   in a matter of hours."
  "If you take hours, you'll never pull it off," Vilhelm
   said, entering our planning room just in time to hear my
   last comment.
  "What's that supposed to mean?" Massha growled.
  "Say, are you sure you guys are on the level?" the
   vampire said, ignoring my apprentice. "It occurs to me
   that I've only got your word on all this... that Vic is
   still alive and all. If you're taking advantage of my good
   nature to get me involved in something crooked...."
  "He's alive," I assured him. "I've seen him myself
   since we were here last... but you didn't answer the
   question. What was that you were saying about what
   would happen if we took hours to plan the jailbreak?"
  The Dispatcher shrugged.
  "I suppose you guys know what you're doing and I
   should keep my mouth shut, but I was getting a little
   worried. I mean, it's sundown already, and if you're
   going to make your move before the execution, it had
   better be soon."
  "How do you figure that?" I frowned. "The action
   isn't slated until high midnight. I had figured on waiting
   a while until it was dark and things quieted down
   around town a little."
  "Are you kidding?" the vampire said with a start, his
   eyebrows going up to his hairline. "That's when ... oh,
   I get it. You're still thinking in terms of your off-
   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   96 Robert Asprin
  dimension timetables. You've got to ... umm, you
   might want to be sitting down for this, Skeeve."
  "Lay it on me," I said, rubbing my forehead again.
   "What have I overlooked now? Even without the blind-
   fold and the cigarette I'd just as soon take the bad news
   standing up."
  "Well, you've got to remember that you're dealing
   with a city of vampires here. Sundown is the equivalent
   of dawn to us. That's when things start happening, not
   when they start winding down! That means...."
  "... that high midnight is a major traffic time and
   the longer we wait, the more people there will be on the
   street," I said, trying to suppress a groan.
  Once the basic oversight had been pointed out, I
   could do my own extrapolations... with all their hor-
   rible consequences. Trying to fight back my own panic,
   I turned to my assistants.
  "Okay, troops. We're on. Guido, grab that rope you
   saw. We may need it before this is over."
  The bodyguard's eyes widened with astonishment.
  "You mean we're going to start the caper right now?
   But Boss! We haven't planned... ."
  "Hey, Guido," I said, flashing a grin that was almost
   sane. "You were the one who said that overplanning
   was a problem. Well, if you're right, this should be the
   most successful jailbreak ever!"
   

   




Chapter Eleven:



   

   "Nice jail. Looks strong.'
  —H. HOUDINI
  VILHELM was right about one thing. The streets were
   nowhere nearly as crowded as they had been the times
   we navigated their length well after sundown. Only a
   few stray beings wandered here and there, mostly mak-
   ing deliveries or sweeping down the sidewalks in front of
   their shops prior to opening. Except for the lack of
   light, the streets looked just like any town preparing for
   a day's business....hat and the red eyes of the citizens.
  We hugged the light as we picked our way across
   town....
  That's right. I said "hugged the light." I try to only
   make the same mistake a dozen times. In other dimen-
   sions, we would have "hugged the dark" to avoid being
   noticed or recognized. Here, we "hugged the light."
   Don't laugh. It worked.
  Anyway, as we picked our way through the streets of
   Blut, most of my attention was taken up with the task of
   trying to map a good getaway route. Getting Aahz out
  97
  98 Robert Asprin
  of jail I would deal with once we got there. Right now I
   was worried about what we would do once we had him
   out... a major assumption, I know, but I had so little
   optimism that I clung to what there was with all fours.
  The three of us looked enough like vampires in ap-
   pearance to pass casual inspection. There was no way,
   however, that we could pass off my scaly green partner
   as a native without a disguise spell, and I wasn't about
   to bet on having any magical energy left after springing
   Aahz. As such, I was constantly craning my neck to peer
   down sidestreets and alleys, hoping to find a little-
   traveled route by which we could spirit our fugitive col-
   league out of town without bringing the entire populace
   down on our necks. By the time we reached our destina-
   tion, I was pretty sure I could get us back to the Dis-
   patcher's by the route we were following, and positively
   sure that if I tried to take us there by the back routes, I
   would get us totally and helplessly lost.
  "Well, Boss. This is it. Think we can crack it?"
  I don't think Guido really expected an answer. He
   was just talking to break the silence that had fallen over
   us as we stood looking at our target.
  The Municipal Building was an imposing structure,
   with thick stone walls and a corner tower that stretched
   up almost out of sight into the darkness. It didn't look
   like we could put a dent in it with a cannon ... if we had
   a cannon, which we didn't. I was used to the tents of the
   Bazaar or the rather ramshackle building style of Klah.
   While I had been gradually getting over being overawed
   by the construction prevalent here in Blut, this place in-
   timidated me. I'd seen shakier looking mountains!
  "Well, one thing's for certain," I began, almost
   under my breath.
  "What's that?"
  "Staring at it isn't going to make it any weaker."
  MYTH-ING PERSONS           99
  Neither of my assistants laughed at my joke, but then
   again, neither did I.
  Shaking off a feeling of foreboding, I turned to my
   staff.
  "All right, Guido. You stay down here and keep
   watch. Massha? Do you think that belt of yours can lift
   two? It's time I went topside and took a good look at
   this impregnable cell."
  My apprentice licked her lips nervously and shrugged.
  "I don't know, Hot Stuff. I warned you that the con-
   trols on this thing don't work right. It could lift us right
   into orbit for all I know."
  I patted her shoulder in what I hoped was a reassuring
   way.
  "Well, give it a try and we'll find out."
  She nodded, wrapped one arm around my chest, and
   used her other hand to play with the jewels on her belt
   buckle.
  There was a sparkle of light, but beyond that nothing.
  "Not enough juice," she mumbled to herself.
  "So turn it up already," I urged.
   - Even if the vampires tended to avoid light, we were lit
   up like a Christmas tree and bound to attract attention
   if we stayed at ground level much longer.
  "Cross your fingers," she said grimly and touched
   the jewels again.
  The light intensified and we started up fast ... too
   fast.
  "Careful, Boss!" Guido shouted and grabbed my
   legs as they went past him.
  That brought our progress to a halt... well, almost.
   Instead of rocketing up into the night, we were rising
   slowly, almost imperceptibly.
  "That's got it, High Roller!" Massha exclaimed,
   shifting her grip to hang onto me with both arms. "A
  100 Robert Asprin
  little more ballast than I had planned on, though."
  I considered briefly telling Guido to let go, but re-
   jected the thought. If the bodyguard released his grip,
   we'd doubtless resume our previous speed... and while
   a lot of folks at the Bazaar talked about my meteoric
   rise, I'd just as soon keep the phrase figurative. There
   was also the minor detail that we were already at a
   height where it would be dangerous for Guido to try
   dropping back to the street. There was that, and his
   death-grip on my legs.
  "Don't tell me, let me guess," I called down to him.
   "You're acrophobic, too?"
  The view of Blut that was unfolding beneath us was
   truly breathtaking. Truly! My life these days was so
   cluttered with crisis and dangers that a little thing like
   looking down on buildings didn't bother me much, but
   even I was finding it hard to breathe when confronted
   up close with sheer walls adorned with stone creatures.
   Still, until I felt his fingernails biting into my calves, it
   had never occurred to me that such things might upset a
   rough-and-tumble guy like Guido.
  "Naw. I got nothin' against spiders," he replied nerv-
   ously. "It's heights that scare me."
  I let that one go. I was busy studying the tower which
   could be viewed much more clearly from this altitude. If
   anything, it looked stronger than the portion of the
   building that was below us. One feature captured my at-
   tention, though. The top portion of the tower, the part I
   assumed was Aahz's cell, was shaped like a large
   dragon's head. The window I had been expecting was
   actually the creature's mouth, with its teeth serving as
   bars.
  I should have anticipated something like that, realiz-
   ing the abundance of stone animals on every other
   building in town. Still, it came as a bit of a surprise...
  MYTH-ING PERSONS          101
  but a pleasant surprise. I had been trying to figure a way
   to get through iron bars, but stone teeth might be a bit
   easier. Maybe with Aahz working from the inside and us
   working from the outside, we could loosen the mortar
   and....
  I suddenly realized that in a few moments we would
   be level with the cell... and that a few moments after
   that we'd be past it! Unless something was done, and
   done fast, to halt our upward progress, we'd only have
   time for a few quick words with Aahz before parting
   company permanently. With time running out fast, I
   cast about for a solution.
  The wall was too far away to grab onto, and there was
   no way to increase our weight, unless....
  When Aahz first taught me to fly, he explained the
   process as "levitation in reverse." That is, instead of
   using the mind to lift objects, you push against the
   ground and lift yourself. Focusing my reservoir of magi-
   cal energy, I used a small portion to try flying in reverse.
   Instead of pushing up, I pushed down!
  Okay. So I was desperate. In a crisis, I'll try anything,
   however stupid. Fortunately, this stupid idea worked!
  Our upward progress slowed to a halt with me hang-
   ing at eye-level with the cell's dragon mouth.
  Trying not to show my relief, I raised my voice.
  "Hey, Aahz! When are visiting hours?"
  For a moment there was no response, and I had a sud-
   den fear that we were hanging a hundred feet in the air
   outside an empty cell. Then my partner's unmistakable
   countenance appeared in the window.
  "Skeeve?" he said in a skeptical voice. "Skeeve!
   What are you doing out there?"
  "Oh, we were just in the neighborhood and thought
   we'd drop in," I replied in my best nonchalant voice.
   "Heard you were in a bit of trouble and thought we'd
  102
  MYTH-ING PERSONS          103
  Robert Asprin
  better get you out before it got serious."
  "Who's we?" my partner demanded, then he focused
   on my assistants. "Oh no! Those two? Where are Tan-
   anda and Chumley? C'mon, Skeeve. I need a rescue
   team and you bring me a circus act!"
  "It's the best I could do on short notice," I shot
   back, slightly annoyed. "Tananda and Chumley aren't
   back from their own work yet, but I left a message for
   them to catch up with us if they could. Of course, I'm
   not sure how much help they'll be. In case you're
   wondering why I'm being carried by my apprentice in-
   stead of flying free, this particular dimension is excep-
   tionally low on force lines to tap in to. If anything, I
   think I'm pretty lucky that I brought 'these two' along
   instead of ending up with a whole team of for-real magi-
   cians who are too proud to use gimmicks. It's thanks to
   'these two' that I made it this far at all. Now, dtf you
   want our help, or do you want to wait for the next team
   to float past? I mean, you're in no rush, are you?"
  "Now don't get your back up, partner," Aahz said
   soothingly. "You caught me a little off-guard is all. So
   tell me, just how do you figure to get me out of here?"
  That brought me back to earth ... or as close to it as 1
   could get while suspended in mid-air.
  "Umm... actually, Aahz, I was kinda hoping you
   might have a few ideas on the subject. You're usually
   pretty good at coming up with plans to get us out of
   tight spots."
  "What I want to know," Guido snarled, turning
   slightly in the wind, "is how come your partner hasn't
   figured a way out of there all by himself, if he's so all-
   fired smart?"
  I started to rebuke my bodyguard, but slowly his
   words sank in. That was a good question! Aahz was
   strong ... I mean STRONG! By rights he should have
  been able to rip the stone teeth out of the window all by
   himself. What was keeping him here?
  "Oh, I'm having so much fun in here I just couldn't
   bear to leave," Aahz barked back. "I'm in here because
   I can't get out, that's why. What's more, if any of you
   have any ideas about how to get me out, I think now's a
   real good time to share them with the rest of us."
  "Wait a minute, Aahz," I said. "Why can't you get
   out... and how did they catch you in the first place?"
  "I was framed," my partner retorted, but I noticed
   his voice was a bit more subdued.
  "We already know that." Impressed. "What I want to
   know is why you didn't just bust a few heads and sprint
   for home? You've never been particularly respectful of
   local authority before."
  To my surprise, Aahz actually looked embarrassed.
  "I was drugged," he said in a disgusted tone. "They
   put something in my drink, and the next thing I knew I
   had a stake and mallet in my hands and a room full of
   officials. Whatever it was they used, it kept me groggy
   all the way through the trial... I mean I couldn't walk
   straight, much less defend myself coherently, and after
   that I was in/we!"
  "The old Mickey Finn trick!" Massha snorted, rock-
   ing our entire formation. "I'm surprised someone as
   off-worldly as you could get caught by such a corny
   stunt."
  "Yeah. It surprised me, too!" Aahz admitted. "I
   mean, that gag is so old, who would really expect any-
   one to try it at all?"
  "Only if you figured the mark was louder than he was
   smart," Guido sneered.
  "Is that so!" my partner snapped, ready to renew
   their old rivalry. "Well, when I get out of here, you and
   me can...."
   

   

   

   

   104 Robert Asprin
  "Stop it, you two," I ordered. "Right now the
   problem is to get us all out of here before the balloon
   goes up ... no offense, Massha. Now spill, Aahz.
   What's so special about this cell that's keeping you bot-
   tled up?"
  My partner heaved a great sigh.
  "Take another look at it, Skeeve. A close look."
  I did. It still looked the same to me: a tower room in
   the shape of a dragon's head.
  "Yeah. Okay. So?"
  "So remember where we are. This thing was built to
   hold vampire criminals. You know, beings with super-
   human strength that can change into mist?"
  My gaze flew back to the dragon's head.
  "I don't get it," I admitted. "How can any stone cell
   hold beings like that?"
  "That's the point." Aahz winced. "A stone cell
   can't\ This thing is made of living stone. If whoever's
   inside tries to bust out, it swallows them. If they try to
   turn into mist, it inhales them."
  "You mean...."
  "Now you're getting the picture."
  He flashed his toothy grin at me despite his obvious
   depression.
  "The cell is alive!"
  Startled by this revelation, I looked at the tower top
   cell again. As if it had been waiting for the right cue, the
   dragon's head opened its eyes and looked at me.
   

   




Chapter Twelve:



   

   "For the right person, the impossible is
   easy!"
  —DUMBO
  To everyone's surprise, particularly my own, I didn't
   find the revelation about the true nature of Aahz's con-
   finement at all discouraging. If anything, I was doubly
   pleased. Not only did I have an immediate idea for how
   to beat the problem, I had arrived at it before my
   knowledgeable partner... well before, as a matter of
   fact, as he had been pondering his dilemma for days
   whereas I had only just received the information. Of
   course, he was probably not in a position to see the easy
   solution that I could.
  "What are you grinning at?" he demanded. "If
   there's anything funny about this, it eludes me com-
   pletely."
  Unlike my own amiable self, Aahz tends to show his
   worry by getting mad. Come to think of it, he tends to
   express almost any emotion by getting mad. Well, at
   least he's consistent.
  "Tell me," I said, eyeing the dragon's head, "you say
   this thing's alive. How alive is it?"
  105
  106
  Robert Asprin
  MYTH-ING PERSONS
  107
  "What do you mean, 'how alive is it'?" Aahz
   scowled. "It's alive enough to swallow me if it gets it
   into it's head. That's alive enough for me.
  "I mean, can it hear and see?"
  "Who cares?" my partner said, in a dazzling display
   of charm and curiosity that makes him so lovable. "I
   hadn't planned on asking it out for a date."
  I stared thoughtfully at the beast.
  "I was just wondering if it could hear me ... say, if I
   said that I thought it was the ugliest building decoration
   I've seen here in town?"
  The dragon's head rewarded me by narrowing its eyes
   into an evil glare.
  "I think it can hear you, Boss," Guido said, shifting
   his grip nervously. "It doesn't look like it liked that last
   comment."
  "Oh, swell!" Aahz grumbled. "Tell you what, part-
   ner. Why don't you come in here and sit on this thing's
   tongue instead of me before you start getting it all riled
  Up?"
  "I was just checking." I smiled. "To tell the truth, I
   think it's the most incredible thing I've seen since I
   started traveling the dimensions. I just said that other to
   test its reactions."
  The dragon stopped glaring, but it still looked a little
   bit suspicous and wary.
  "Well, find some other reaction to test, okay?" my
   partner snapped. "For some obscure reason, I'm a little
   nervous these days, and every time this thing moves its
   tongue I age a few centuries."
  I ignored his grumbling and shook one of my legs.
  "Hey, Guido! Are you still paying attention down
   there?"
  His grip tightened fiercely.
  "Of course I'm paying attention, you little ... I
  mean, yeah, Boss. There's not much else to do while
   we're hangin'. here, know what I mean? And quit jerk-
   ing your leg around... please?"
  I found his verbal slip rather interesting, but now
   wasn't the time to investigate further.
  "Well, listen up," I said. "Here's what I want you to
   do. I want you to let go with one hand and pass the rope
   up to me. ..."
  "No way, Boss! Have you seen how far down it is?
   I'm not lettin' go no matter what you. ..."
  "... because if you don't," I continued as if he
   hadn't interrupted, "I'm going to start squirming
   around until either you lose your grip with both hands
   or Massha loses her grip on me. Whichever way it goes,
   you'll fall. Get my drift? Now for once could you just
   follow orders without a lot of back-talk? We don't have
   much time to pull this off."
  There was a stricken silence below as Guido absorbed
   my ultimatum and weighed the possibilities.
  "Pull what off?" Aahz demanded. "Why doesn't
   anybody tell me anything? If this master plan of yours is
   riding on that sorry excuse for a bodyguard, you might
   as well give up right now. I've told you all along that he
   was too lily-livered to be any good at. ..."
  "Who's lily-livered?!" Guido shouted. "Look, Big
   Mouth, as soon as we get you out of there, you and me
   are going to settle this once and. ..."
  "First, we've got to get him out, Guido," I inter-
   rupted. "The rope."
  "Right, Boss. One rope coming up. We'll see who's
   lily-livered. The last person who called me that was my
   mom, and by the time I got done with her...."
  Our whole formation began to rock dangerously as he
   fumbled through his coat one-handed in search of the
   rope. For a minute, I was afraid he was mad enough to
   

   

   

   

   Robert Asprin
  108
  let go with both hands to speed his search.
  "Easy there, Guido," I cautioned. "We can.... ."
  "Here it is, Boss!" he said, flipping the rope up so
   violently that it almost whacked me in the face. "I hope
   you can use it to hang the son of a...."
  "Hanging isn't enough!" Aahz taunted. "It takes
   more than a piece of rope to do me in."
  "Yeah. It takes a little girl with blue eyes and a spiked
   drink," my bodyguard sneered back. "If you think I'm
   going to let you live that one down...."
  I forced myself to ignore them. While it was tempting
   to rally to Luanna's defense, there were other more
   pressing matters to attend to.
  Moving as carefully as I could, I looped one end of
   the rope up and around Massha's waist. It took a couple
   of tries and a lot more rope than I would have liked, but
   finally I managed to catch the dangling end and tie it off
  securely.
  "What's with the rope, Hot Stuff?" Massha said
   calmly, the only one of our group who had managed to
   keep her cool through the entire proceedings.
  "Well, with any luck, in a little while we're going to
   be heading down... with Aahz," I explained. "Even
   though I know you're strong, I don't think your hands
   are strong enough to keep a grip on all three of us while
   we make the trip. This is to be sure we don't lose anyone
  after we spring the cell."
  "Speaking of that," Aahz called, "I'm still waiting to
   hear how you're going to get me out of this thing. You
   might even say I'm dying to find out."
  He wasn't the only one. The dragon's head was
   watching my every movement through slitted eyes. I'm
   not sure how much pride it took in its job, but it was ob-
   vious the beast wasn't getting ready to overwhelm us
   with its cooperation.
  MYTH-ING PERSONS          109
  Everything was as ready as I could make it, so I de-
   cided it was time to play my trump card.
  "There's nothing to it, really," I told my partner with
   a smile. "Talk to me."
  It isn't often I catch my old mentor totally by surprise
   ... I get him upset on a fairly regular basis, but total
   surprise was a real rarity. This was one of those golden
   times.
  "Say WHAT?" Aahz exclaimed loudly.
  "Trust me, Aahz," I insisted. "I know what I'm
   doing. Just talk to me. Tell me a story. How did you
   first meet Garkin?"
  "Oh, that," he said, rolling his eyes expressively.
   "Well, we were at the same boring cocktail party, see
   ... you know, one of those dreary affairs where the
   crowd has you pinned against the wall and you get stuck
   talking to whatever the tide washes up against you?
   Anyway, he was trying to impress some little bit of fluff
   with his magic, which really wasn't all that hot in those
   days ... let me tell you, partner, anytime you start get-
   ting depressed with your lack of progress in the magic
   business, remind me to tell you what your old teacher
   Garkin was like when we first met. But, as I was saying,
   out of respect for the craft, I just had to wander over
   and show them what the real stuff looked like... not
   that I had any interest in her myself, mind you...."
  I felt Guido tugging on my pantleg.
  "Say, Boss," he complained. "What is this? I
   thought we were in a hurry."
  "This is what we needed the time for," I whispered
   back.
  "For thisV he grumbled. "But Boss, if we don't get
   started. ..."
  "We're started," I answered. "Now pay attention to
   what he's saying."
  110
  Robert Asprin
  I was afraid our side comments might have distracted
   Aahz, but I needn't have worried. As per normal, once
   my partner got on a verbal roll, he wasn't that easy to
  stop.
  "...so there we were, just the three of us, mind you,
   and remember, our clothes were five floors away at this
  point...."
  "What's going on, Hot Stuff?" Massha hissed from
   her position above me. "I know you've heard this story
   before. Heck, I've heard it four times myself."
  "Keep your eye on the dragon," I advised her. "And
   be ready to act fast."
  I was going through the motions of reacting to Aahz's
   story and fielding the impatient questions of my assis-
   tants as best I could, but my real attention was focused
   on the dragon's head. My strategy was already working.
   Aahz's droning account of past glories was starting to
   take effect.
  The dragon's eyes were definitely starting to glaze.
  "...of course, after all that, I just had to take her
   home with me. It was the least I could do for the poor
   thing under the circumstances."
  Aahz was winding up his story already! I had to keep
   him going just a little bit longer.
  "Was that the party where you met Tananda?" I
   said, deliberately feeding him another cue.
  "Tananda? No. That's another story completely. I
   met her when I was sitting in on a cut-throat game of
   dragon poker over at the Geek's. We had a real pigeon
   on the line, the kind of idiot who would bet a busted
   Corp's a' Corp's into a Unicorn Flush showing,
   you know? Well, I was a little low on funds just then,
  Guido was getting restless again.
   "Boss, how much longer are we gonna...."
  MYTH-ING PERSONS          111
  "Not much longer," I interrupted. "Get hold of the
   rope. We're about to move."
  "... now I was holding Ogres back-to-back ... or
   was it Elves? No, it was Ogres. I remember because
   Tananda had Elves wrapped up. Of course, we didn't
   know that until the end of the hand. Anyway, as soon as
   the Geek opened, I bumped him back limit, and Tan-
   anda ..."
  That did it. I should have known a hand-by-hand,
   bet-by-bet description of dragon poker would do the
   trick.
  Without any warning at all, the dragon yawned...
   long and wide.
  Aahz broke off his narration, a momentous event in
   itself, and blinked his surprise.
  "Quick, Aahz! Jump for it!"
  Bewildered as he was, there was nothing wrong with
   my partner's reflexes. He was out of the dragon's
   mouth in a flash, diving through the air to catch the
   rope below Guido.
  As soon as his hands closed on our lifeline, several
   things happened at the same time.
  With the extra weight on Massha's levitation belt, our
   whole formation started to sink at an alarming rate...
   my apprentice lost her grip on me, giving me minor rope
   burns as I clutched madly for the rope, almost too late
   to follow the advice I had been so freely giving to every-
   one else ... and the dragon closed his mouth.
  I caught one last glimpse of the beast before we sank
   from sight, and I honestly don't think he even knew we
   were gone. His eyelids were at half-mast, and the eyes
   themselves were out of focus from boredom. Aahz's
   stories tended to have that effect on even vaguely-intelli-
   gent beings. I had simply found a practical application
   for the phenomenon.
  Robert Asprin
  112
  "I've gotta change the controls, Hot Stuff!" Massha
   called, alerting me once more to our current situation.
  The ground was rushing up to meet us with frighten-
   ing speed.
  I remembered the faulty controls that held all of us at
  their mercy.
  "No! Wait, Massha! Let me try...."
  Exerting my last ounce of reserve power, I worked at
   levitating our whole crew. Under normal circumstances,
   I could lift three people easily and four or five in a
   pinch. Here in Limbo, using everything I had with
   Massha's belt assisting me, I barely managed to slow
  our descent to a moderate crawl.
  "What happened there, partner?" Aahz called.
   "How did you know that thing was going to yawn?"
  "Call it a lucky guess," I grunted, still concentrating
   on keeping us from crashing. "I'll explain later."
  "Check the landing zone," Guido warned.
  I sneaked a peak.
  We had been at our task longer than I thought. The
   sidewalk below was crowded with vampires strolling
   here and there as Blut's legendary nightlife fired up.
  "I don't think we can bluff our way through this
   one," Aahz said calmly. "Any chance you can steer us
   around the corner into the alley? There doesn't seem to
  be as much of a crowd there."
  Before I could answer, something flashed past us
  from above with a flutter of leather wings.
  "JAILBREAK!" it screamed, banking around the
   corner. "Murderer on the loose! JAILBREAK!"
   

   




Chapter Thirteen:



   

   "I've never seen so damn many Indians."
   —G. A. CUSTER
  THE words of alarm had an interesting effect on the
   crowd below. After a brief glance to see us descending
   into their midst, to a man they turned and ran. In a
   twinkling, the street was empty.
  "What's going on?" I called to Aahz, unable to
   believe our good fortune.
  "Beats me!" my partner shouted back. "I guess none
   of the normal citizenry want to tangle with an escaped
   murderer. Better get us down fast before they figure out
   how badly outnumbered we are."
  I didn't have to be told twice. Our escape had just
   gotten an unexpected blessing, but I wasn't about to
   make book on how long it would last. I cut my magical
   support, and we dropped swiftly toward the pavement.
  "What was that that blew the whistle on us?" Massha
   said, peering up into the darkness where our mysterious
   saboteur had disappeared.
  "I think it was that Vic character," Guido answered
   from below me. "I got a pretty good look at him when
  113
  114 Robert Asprin
  he bolted past me back at the Woof Writers."
  "Really?" I asked, half to myself, twisting around to
   look after the departed villain. "That's one more we
   owe him."
  "Later," Aahz commanded, touching down at last.
   "Right now we've got to get out of here."
  Guido was beside him in a second. I had to drop a
   ways, as with the extra weight removed from the rope,
   we had ceased to sink.
  "C'mon, Massha!" I called. "Cut the power in that
   thing. It's not that far to fall."
  "I'm trying!" she snapped back, fiddling with the
   belt buckle once more. "The flaming thing's malfunc-
   tioning again!"
  The belt setting had changed. Holding the rope, I
   could feel that there was no longer an upward pull.
   Unfortunately, Massha wasn't sinking, either. Instead,
   she hovered in mid-air about fifteen feet up.
  "Hey, Boss! We got company!"
  I followed my bodyguard's gaze. There was a mob
   forming down the street to our left, and it didn't look
   happy. Of course, it was hard to tell for sure, but I had
   the definite impression that their eyes were glowing red-
   der than normal, which I was unable to convince myself
   was a good sign.
  "Maasshhhha!" I nagged, my voice rising uncon-
   trollably as I tugged on the rope.
  "It's jammed!" she whimpered. "Go on, take off,
   Hot Stuff. No sense in all of us getting caught."
  "We can't just leave you here," I argued.
  "We don't have time for a debate," Aahz snarled.
   "Guido! Get up there ahead of us and keep the street
   open. We can't afford to get cut off. Okay, let's go!"
  With that, he snatched the rope out of my hand and
   took off running down the street away from the crowd
   with Guido out front in point position and Massha
  MYTH-ING PERSONS          115
  floating over his head like a gaudy balloon. For once, I
   didn't object to him giving orders to my bodyguard. I
   was too busy sprinting to keep up with the rest of my
   group.
  If the watching mob was having any trouble deciding
   what to do, the sight of us fleeing settled it. With a
   howl, they swarmed down the street in pursuit.
  When I say "with a howl," I'm not speaking figura-
   tively. As they ran, some of the vampires transformed
   into large, fierce-looking dogs, others into bats, pre-
   sumably to gain more speed in the chase. While Aahz
   and I had been chased by mobs before, this was the first
   pack of pursuers who literally bayed at our heels. I must
   say I didn't care much for the experience.
  "Where are we going, Aahz?" I panted.
  "Away from them!" he called back.
  "I mean, eventually," I pressed. "We're heading the
   wrong way to get back to our hideout."
  "We can't hole up until we've shaken our fan club,"
   my partner insisted. "Now shut up and run."
  I had certain doubts about our ability to elude our
   pursuers while towing Massha overhead to mark our
   position, but I followed Aahz's instructions and
   pumped the pavement for all I was worth. For one
   thing, if I pointed out this obvious fact to my partner,
   he might simply let go of the rope and leave my appren-
   tice to fend for herself. Then again, the option to run-
   ning was to stand firm and face the mob. All in all,
   running seemed like a real good idea.
  Guido was surprisingly good at clearing a path for us.
   I had never really seen my bodyguard in action, but with
   his constant carping and allergy problems throughout
   this venture, I was tending to discount his usefulness.
   Not so. The vampires we encountered in our flight had
   not heard the alarm and were unprepared for the whirl-
   wind that burst into their midst. Guido never seemed to
  116 Robert Asprin MYTH-ING PERSONS 117
  break stride as he barreled into victim after victim, but
   whatever he did to them was effective. None of the
   fallen bodies which marked his progress attempted to
   interfere with Aahz or I ... heck, they didn't even
   move.
  "River ahead. Boss!" he called over his shoulder.
  "What's that?" I puffed, realizing for the first time
   how out of shape I had grown during my prosperous
   stay at the Bazaar.
  "A river!" he repeated. "The street we're on is going
   to dead-end into a river in a few blocks. I can see it'from
   here. We're going to have to change direction or we'll
   get pinned against the water."
  I wondered whether it wouldn't be a good idea for us
   to just plunge into the river and put some moving water
   between us and the vampires, as I seemed to recall a
   legend that that was one of the things that could stop
   them. Then it occurred to me that my bodyguard prob-
   ably couldn't swim.
  "Head right!" Aahz shouted. "There! Up that
   alley."
  Guido darted off on the indicated course with my
   partner and I pounding along about fifteen paces
   behind him. We had built up a bit of a lead on our pur-
   suers, though we could still hear their cries and yelps a
   block or so back, and for the first time I started to have
   the hope that we might actually elude them. Now that
   we were out of their line of sight....
  "Lookout. ..."
  There was a sudden cry from above, and Massha
   came crashing to the ground, gaming the dubious
   distinction of being the first person I've ever witnessed
   doing a belly-flop on dry land. I'm sure the ground
   didn't actually shake, but the impact was enough to
   leave that impression. I experienced a quick flash of
   guilt, realizing that my first thought was not for the
  well-being of my apprentice, but rather unbridled relief
   that she hadn't landed on one of us.
  "I think the controls just came unstuck," Aahz said,
   rather unnecessarily to my thinking.
  "Are you all right, Massha?" I said, crouching over
   her.
  "Wha—ha ..." came the forced reply.
  "Of course, she's not all right," Aahz snapped,
   assuming translator duties. "At the very least she's got
   the wind knocked out of her."
  Whatever the exact extent of the damages suffered
   from her fall, my apprentice wasn't even trying to rise. I
   would have liked to give her a few minutes recovery
   time, but already the sounds of our pursuers were draw-
   ing closer.
  "Can you carry her, Aahz?"
  "Not on my best day," my partner admitted, eyeing
   Massha's sizable bulk. "How about you? Have you got
   enough juice left to levitate her?"
  I shook my head violently.
  "Used it all supervising our aerial maneuvers back at
   the jail."
  "Hey. Boss!" Guido hissed, emerging from the
   shadows behind us. "The alley's blocked. This is the
   only way out!"
  And that was that. Even if we got Massha up and
   moving, all it meant was that we'd have to retrace our
   steps right back into the teeth of the mob. We had run
   our race... and were about to lose it rather spectacu-
   larly.
  The others knew it, too.
  "Well, it's been nice working with you, Guido,"
   Aahz said with a sigh. "I know I've gotten on your case
   a couple of times, but you're a good man to have
   around in a pinch. You did some really nice crowd work
   getting us this far. Sorry about that last turn call."
   

   

   

   

   118 Robert Asprin MYTH-ING PERSONS 119
  "No hard feelings," my bodyguard shrugged. "You
   gave it your best shot. This alley would have been my
   choice, too, if I'd been workin' alone. Boss, I warned
   you I was a jinx when it came to jailbreaks. I gotta ad-
   mit, though, for a while there I really thought we were
   goin' to pull this one off."
  "It was a long shot at best." I grinned. "At least you
   can't say that this one suffered from over-planning."
  Aahz clapped a hand on my shoulder.
  "Well, partner?" he said. "Any thoughts on how to
   play this one? Do we try to surrender peacefully, or go
   down swinging?"
  I wasn't sure the crowd would give us a choice. They
   were almost at our alley, and they didn't sound like they
   cared much for talking.
  "NOT THIS WAY! THEY'RE DOUBLING BACK
   TOWARD THE JAIL!"
  This unexpected cry came from the street near the
   mouth of our alley.
  I.couldn't believe it, but apparently the mob did.
   There were curses and shouted orders, but from their
   fast-fading manner it was plain that the crowd had
   turned and was now heading back the way they had
  come.
  "What was that?" Massha managed, her voice re-
   turning at last.
  I motioned her to be silent and cocked an eyebrow at
   Aahz, silently asking the same question.
  He answered with an equally silent shake of the head.
   Neither of us knew for sure what was going on, but
   we both sensed that the timely intervention was neither
   accidental nor a mistake. Someone had deliberately
   pulled the crowd off our backs. Before we celebrated
   our good fortune, we wanted to know who and why.
   A pair of figures appeared at the mouth of the alley.
   "You can come out now," one of them called.
  "Sorry to interfere, but it looked like so much fun we
   just had to play, too."
  I'd know that voice anywhere, even if I didn't
   recognize the figure as well as the unmistakable form of
   her brother.
  "Tananda! Chumley!" I shouted, waving to pinpoint
   our position. "I was wondering when you'd show up."
  The sister-brother team of Trollop and Troll hastened
   to join us. For all their lighthearted banter, I can think
   of few beings I'd rather have on or at my side when
   things get tight.
  "Are you all right?" Tananda asked, stopping to help
   Massha to her feet.
  "Really never had much dignity," my apprentice
   responded, "and what little I did have is shot to hell.
   Except for that I'm fine. I'm starting to see why you Big
   Leaguers are so down on mechanical magic."
  Chumley seized my hand and pumped it vigorously.
  "Now don't be too rough on your little gimmicks,
   ducks," he advised. "That little ring you left us was just
   the ticket we needed to get here in time for the latest in
   our unbroken string of last-minute rescues. Except for
   the typical hash you've made of your end-game, it looks
   like you've done rather well without us. We've got all
   present and accounted for, including Aahz, who seems
   remarkably unscathed after yet one more near-brush
   with disaster. Seems like all that's left is a hasty retreat
   and a slow celebration ... eh, what?"
  "That's about the size of it," I agreed. "It's great
   having the two of you along to ride shotgun on our exit,
   though. Speaking of which, can you find the castle from
   here? I've gotten a little turned around...."
  "Hold it right there!" Aahz broke in. "Before we get
   too wrapped up in congratulating each other, aren't
   there a few minor details being overlooked?"
  The group looked at each other.
   

   

   

   

   120
  Robert Asprin
  "Like what?" Tananda said at last.
  "Like the fact that I'm still wanted for murder, for
   one," my partner glared. "Then again, there's the three
   fugitives we're supposed to be bringing back to Deva
  with us."
  "Oh, come on, Aahz," the Trollop chided, poking
   him playfully in the ribs. "With the reputation you
   already have, what's a little thing like a murder war-
   rant?"
  "I didn't do it," Aahz insisted. "Not only didn't I
   kill this Vic character, nobody did. He's still around
   somewhere laughing down his sleeve at all of us. Now
   while I'll admit my reputation isn't exactly spotless, it
   doesn't include standing still for a bum rap ... or let-
   ting someone get away with making a fool of me!"
  "Of course, saving the money for paying the
   swindlers' debts plus the fines involved has nothing to
   do with it, eh, Aahz?" Chumley said, winking his larger
  eye.
  "Well... that, too," my partner admitted. "Isn't it
   nice that we can take care of both unpleasant tasks at
  the same time?"
  "Maybe we could settle for just catching Vic and let
  the others go," I murmured.
  "How's that again, partner?"
  "Nothing, Aahz," I said with a sigh. "It's just that
   ... nothing. C'mon everybody. If we're going to go
   hunting, it's going to require a bit of planning, and I
   don't think we should do it out here in the open."
   

   




Chapter Fourteen:



   

   "Relax, Julie. Everyone will understand."
   —ROMEO
  FORTUNATELY, Massha's elevated position during our
   flight had given her an excellent view of our surround-
   ings, and we were able to find our way back to the
   Dispatcher's without being discovered by the aroused
   populace. Now that our numbers had increased, how-
   ever, Vilhelm's greeting was noticeably cooler.
  "I'm starting to believe what everybody says," the
   little vampire complained. "Let one demon in, and the
   next thing you know the neighborhood's crawling with
   them. When I decided to talk to you folks instead of
   blowing the whistle on you, I didn't figure on turning
   my office into a meeting place for off-worlders."
  "C'mon, Vilhelm," I said, trying to edge my foot
   into the doorway. "We don't have any place else to go
   in town. There aren't that many of us."
  "We could always just wait out on the street until the
   authorities come by," Aahz suggested. "I don't imagine
   it would take much to convince them that this guy has
   been harboring fugitives."
  121
   

   

   

   

   122              Robert Asprin
  "Can it. Green and Scaly," Massha ordered, puffing
   herself up to twice her normal size. "Vilhelm's been nice
   to us so far. and I won't listen to anyone threaten him,
   even you. Just remember that you'd still be cooling your
   heels in the slammer if it weren't for him. Either he
   helps of his own free will, or we look elsewhere."
   Aahz gave ground before her righteous indignation.
   "Are you going to let your apprentice talk to me that
  way? "he demanded.
  "Only when she's right." I shrugged.
  "I say, Aahz," Chumley intervened. "Could you
   possibly curb your normally vile manners for a few mo-
   ments? We don't really need one more enemy in this di-
   mension, and I, for one, would appreciate the chance to
   extend my thanks to this gentleman before he throws us
  out."
   When he's working, Chumley goes by the name of
  Big Crunch and does a Neanderthal that's the envy of
   half the barbarians at the Bazaar. On his own time,
   however, his polished charm has solved a lot of prob-
   lems for us ... almost as many as Aahz's bluster has
  gotten us into.
  "Oh, come on in," the Dispatcher grumbled. "Enter
  freely and of your own accord and all that. I never could
   turn my back on somebody in trouble. Guess that's why
   I've never traveled the other dimensions myself. They'd
  eat me alive out there."
  "Thanks, Vilhelm," I said, slipping past him into the
  office before he could change his mind. "You'll have
   to forgive my partner. He really isn't always like this.
   Being on death row hasn't done much for his sense of
  humor."
  "I guess I'm a little edgy myself," the vampire ad-
   mitted. "Strange as it sounds, I've been worried about
   you folks... and your motor-mouthed friend who's
   been keeping me company hasn't helped things much."
  MYTH-ING PERSONS          123
  I did a quick nose count of our troop.
  "Wait a minute," I frowned. "Who's been waiting
   for us?"
  Now it was Vilhelm's turn to look surprised.
  "Didn't one of you send out for a werewolf? He said
   he was with you."
  "Aahh! But I am! My friends, they do not know me
   yet, but I shall be their salvation, no?"
  With that, I was overwhelmed by a shaggy rug. Well,
   at least that's what I thought until it came off the floor
   and threw itself into my arms with the enthusiasm of a
   puppy ... a very large puppy.
  "What's that?!." Aahz said, his eyes narrowing dan-
   gerously. "Skeeve, can't I leave you alone for a few
   days without you picking up every stray in any given di-
   mension?"
  "That," in this case, was one of the scroffiest-look-
   ing werewolves I'd ever seen... realizing, of course,
   that until this moment I'd only seen two. He had dark
   bushy eyebrows (if you'll believe that on a werewolf)
   and wore a white stocking cap with a maple leaf on the
   side. His whiskers were carefully groomed into a han-
   dlebar mustache, and what might have been a goatee
   peered from beneath his chin. Actually, viewed piece-
   meal, he was very well-groomed. It's just when taken in
   its entirety that he looked scroffy. Maybe it was the
   leer... .
  "Honest, Aahz," I protested, trying to untangle
   myself. "I've never seen him before in my life!"
  "Oh, but forgive me," the beast said, releasing me so
   suddenly I almost fell. "I am so stupeed, I forget to in-
   troduce. So! I am an artist extraordinaire, but also, I am
   ze finest track-air in ze land. My friends, the Woof
   Writers, they have told me of your pro-blem and I have
   flown like ze wind to aid you. No? I am Pepe Le Garou
   A. and I am at your service."
  124
  MYTH-ING PERSONS          125
  Robert Asprin
  With that, he swept into a low bow with a flourish
   that if I hadn't been so flabbergasted I would have ap-
   plauded. It occurred to me that now I knew why the
   Woof Writers had snickered when they told us they
   knew of someone who could help.
  "Boss," Guido said, his voice muffled by his hand,
   which he was holding over his nose and mouth. "Shall I
  wait outside?"
  Tananda cocked an eyebrow at him.
  "Allergy problems? Here, try some of this. No
   dimension traveler should be without it."
  She produced a small vial and tossed it to my
   bodyguard. "Rub some onto your upper lip just below
  your nose."
  "Gee, thanks," Guido said, following her instruc-
   tions. "What is it?"
  "It's a counter-allergenic paste." She shrugged. "I
  think it has a garlic base."
  "WHAT?" my bodyguard exclaimed, dropping the
  vial.
  Tananda favored him with one of her impish grins.
   "Just kidding. Nunzio was worried about you and
   told us about your allergies ... all of them."
   Her brother swatted her lightly on the rump.
   "Shame on you, little sister," he said, smiling in spite
   of himself. "After you get done apologizing to Guido, I
   suggest you do the same for our host. I think you nearly
   gave him a heart attack with that last little joke."
  This was, of course, just what I needed while stranded
   in a hostile dimension. A nervous vampire, a melo-
   dramatic werewolf, and now my teammates decide it's
   time to play practical jokes on each other.
  "Ummm... tell me, Mr. A.," I said, ignoring my
   other problems and turning to the werewolf. "Do you
  think you can...."
  "No, non," he interrupted. "Eet is simply Pepe, eh?"
  "Pepe A.," I repeated dutifully.
  "Zat's right," he beamed, apparently delighted with
   my ability to learn a simple phrase. "Now, before we
   ... how you say, get down to ze business, would you do
   me ze hon-air of introducing me to your colleagues?"
  "Oh. Sorry. This is my partner, Aahz. He's...."
  "But of course! Ze famous Aahz! I have so long
   wished to meet you."
  If there's anything that can coax Aahz out of a bad
   mood, it's flattery... and Pepe seemed to be an expert
   in that category.
  "You've heard of me?" he blinked. "I mean...
   what exactly have you heard? There have been so many
   adventures over the years."
  "Do you not remem-bair Piere? I was raised from a
   pup on his tales of your fight with Isstvan."
  "Piere? You know Piere?"
  "Do I know him? He is my uncle!"
  "No kidding. Hey, Tananda! Did you hear that?
   Pepe here's Piere's nephew. Wait'11 we tell Gus."
  I retired from the conversation, apparently forgotten
   in the reunion.
  "Say, Skeeve," Vilhelm said, appearing at my side.
   "It looks like this could take a while. Should I break out
   the wine?"
  That got my attention.
  "Wine? You've got wine?"
  "Stocked up on it after your last visit," the vampire
   admitted with a grin. "Figured it might come in handy
   the next time you came through. I may gripe a bit, but
   talking to you and your friends is a lot more fun than
   watching the tubes."
  "Well bring it out... but I get the first glass. Unless
   you've got lots there won't be much left after my part-
   ner there gets his claws on it."
  I turned back to the proceedings just in time to see
   

   

   

   

   126              Robert Asprin
  Pepe kissing my apprentice's hand.
  "Do not be afraid, my little flow-air," he was saying.
   "Here is one who truly appreciates your beauty, as well
   as ... how should I say it, its quantity?"
  "You're kinda cute," Massha giggled. "But I never
   did go in much for inter-species dating, if you get my
  drift."
  I caught Aahz's attention and drew him away from
  the group.
  "Could you take over for a while here, partner?" I
  said. "I've been running nonstop since the start of this
   thing and could use a little time by myself to recharge
  my batteries before we fire up again."
  "No problem," he nodded, laying a hand on my
   shoulder. "I figure we won't be moving before sunup
   ... and Skeeve? I haven't had a chance to say it, but
  thanks for the bail-out."
  "Don't mention it," I grinned weakly. "Tell me you
  wouldn't do the same for me."
  "Don't know," he retorted. "You've never sucker-
   punched me at the beginning of a caper."
  "Now that I still owe you for."
  Just then, Vilhelm appeared with the wine, and Aahz
  hurried away to rejoin the group.
  I managed to snag a goblet and retired to a secluded
   corner while the party went into high gear. Pepe seemed
   to be fitting in well with the rest of the team, if not fu -
   tioning as a combination jester and spark plug, but
   somehow I felt a bit distant. Sipping my wine, I stared
   off into the distance at nothing in particular, letting my
  thoughts wander.
  "What's the trouble, handsome?"
   "Hmmm? Oh. Hi, Tananda. Nothing in particular.
  Just a little tired, that's all."
  "Mind if I join you?" she said, dropping to the floor
   beside me before I could stop her. "So. Are you going
  MYTH-ING PERSONS          127
  to tell me about it? Who is she?"
  I turned my head slowly to look at her directly.
  "I beg your pardon?"
  She kept her eyes averted, idly running one finger
   around the rim of her goblet.
  "Look," she said, "if you don't want to talk about
   it, just say so ... it's really none of my business. Just
   don't try to kid me or yourself that there's nothing
   bothering you. I've known you a long time now, and I
   can usually tell when there's something eating you. My
   best guess right now, if I'm any judge of the phenom-
   enon, is that it's a girl."
  Ever since I'd met Tananda, I'd had a crush on her.
   With her words, though, I suddenly realized how badly
   I wanted someone to talk to. I mean, to Guido and
   Massha I was an authority figure, and I wasn't about to
   open up to Aahz until I was sure he'd take the problem
   seriously and not just laugh, and as for Chumley...
   how do you talk about woman problems with a troll?
  "Okay. You got me," I said, looking back into my
   wine. "It's a girl."
  "I thought so," Tananda smiled. "Where have you
   been keeping her? Tell me, is she beautiful and sen-
   sitive?"
  "All that and more." I nodded, taking another drink
   from my goblet. "She's also on the wrong side."
  "Woops," Tananda said, straightening up. "You'd
   better run that one past me again."
  I filled her in on my encounters with Luanna. I tried
   to keep it unbiased and informative, but even I could
   tell that my tones were less controlled than I would have
   liked.
  Tananda sat in silence for a few moments after I'd
   finished, hugging her legs and with her chin propped up
   on her knees.
  "Well," she said at last, "from what you say, she's
  128
  Robert Asprin
  an accomplice at best. Maybe we can let her go after we
   get them all rounded up."
  "Sure."
   My voice was flat. Both Tananda and I knew that
  once Aahz got on his high horse there was no telling
   how merciful or vicious he would be at any given point.
   "Well, there's always a chance," she insisted. "Aahz
   has always had a soft spot where you're concerned. If
   you intercede for her, and if she's willing to abandon
  her partners. ..."
  "... and, if a table had wings, we could fly it back to
  the Bazaar." I frowned. "No, Tananda. First of all, she
   won't give up her partners just because they're in a
   crunch. That much I know. Besides, if I put that kind of
   pressure on her, to choose between me and them, I'd
   never know for sure if she really wanted me or if she was
   just trying to save her own skin."
   Tananda got to her feet.
  "Don't become so wise that you're stupid, Skeeve,"
   she said softly before she left. "Remember, Luanna's
   already chosen you twice over her partners. Both times
   she's risked her life and their getaway to pass you a
   warning. Maybe all she needs is what you haven't yet
   ' given her—an invitation for a chance at a new life with a
   new partner. Don't be so proud or insecure that you'd
   throw a genuine admirer to the wolves rather than run
   the risk of making a mistake. If you did, I don't think
   I'd like you much... and I don't think you would
  either."
  I pondered Tananda's advice after she'd gone. There
  was one additional complication I hadn't had the nerve
   to mention to her. Whatever Luanna's feelings for me
   were, how would they change when she found out I'd
   used her scarf... her token of affection, to guide a
   pack of hunters to their target?
   

   




Chapter Fifteen:



   

   "Everybody needs a career manager!"
  —LADY MACBETH
  "So where is he?" Aahz grumbled for the hundredth
   time ... in the last five minutes.
  The sun had been up for hours, or at least as up as it
   seemed to get in this dimension. Since my arrival in
   Limbo, I had never seen what I am accustomed to think-
   ing of as full sunlight. Whether the constant heavy over-
   cast condition which seemed to prevail during daylight
   hours was the result of magic or some strange meteor-
   ologic condition I was never sure, but it did nothing to
   alleviate the air of gloom that clung to the town of Blut
   like a shroud.
  The whole team was impatient to get started, but
   Aahz was the only one who indulged himself in express-
   ing his feelings as often ... or as loudly. Of course, it
   might have been simply that he was making so much of
   a fuss that the others were willing to let him provide the
   noise for all of them rather than letting their own efforts
   get constantly upstaged.
  "Just take it easy, partner," I said soothingly, strug-
  129
  130
  Robert Asprin                                   MYTH-ING PERSONS
  131
  gling to keep from snapping at him in my own nervous
   impatience. "There aren't that many all-day stores in
  this dimension."
  "What do you expect, dealing with a bunch of vam-
   pires," he snapped. "I still don't like this idea. Non-
   magical disguises seem unnatural somehow."
  I heaved a quiet sigh inside and leaned back to wait,
   propping my feet up on a chair. This particular quarrel
   was old before Vilhelm had left on his shopping trip,
   and I was tired going over it again and again.
  "Be reasonable, Aahz," Tananda said, taking up the
   slack for me. "You know we can't wander around town
   like this... especially you with half the city looking for
   you. We need disguises, and without a decent power
   source, Skeeve here can't handle disguises for all of us.
   Besides, it's not like we're using mechanical magic. We
   won't be using magic at all."
  "That's what everybody keeps telling me," my part-
   ner growled. "We're just going to alter our appearances
   without using spells. That sounds like mechanical magic
   to me. Do you know what's going to happen to our
   reputations if word of this gets back to the Bazaar? Par-
   ticularly with most of the competition looking for a
   chance to splash a little mud on the Great Skeeve's
   name? Remember, we're already getting complaints
   that our prices are too high, and if this gets out...."
  The light dawned. I could finally see what was eating
   at Aahz. I should have known there was money at the
  bottom of this.
  "But Aahz," I chimed in, "our fees are overpriced.
   I've been saying that for months. I mean, it's not like we
   need the money...."
  ". .. and I've been telling you for months that it's the
   only way to keep the riff-raff from draining away all
   your practice time," he shot back angrily. "Remember,
   your name's supposed to be the Great Skeeve, not the
  Red Cross. You don't do charity."
  Now we were on familiar ground. Unlike the disguise
   thing, this was one argument I never tired of.
  "I'm not talking about charity," I said. "I'm talking
   about a fair fee for services rendered."
  "Fair fee?" my partner laughed, rolling his eyes.
   "You mean like that deal you cut with Watzisname?
   Did he ever tell you about that one, Tananda? We catch
   a silly bird for this Deveel, see, and my partner charges
   him a flat fee. Not a percentage, mind you, a flat fee.
   And how much of a flat fee? A hundred gold pieces? A
   thousand. No. TEN. Ten lousy gold pieces. And half an
   hour later the Deveel sells his 'poor little bird' for over a
   hundred thousand. Nice to know we don't do charity,
   isn't it?"
  "C'mon, Aahz," I argued, writhing inside. "That
   was only five minutes' work. How was I supposed to
   know the silly bird was on the endangered species list?
   Even .you thought it was a good deal until we heard what
   the final sale was. Besides, if I had held out for a per-
   centage and the Deveel had been legit and never sold the
   thing, we wouldn't have even gotten ten gold pieces out
   of it."
  "I never heard the details from your side," Tananda
   said, "but what I picked up on the streets was that
   everybody at the Bazaar was really impressed. Most
   folks think that it's a master-stroke of PR for the hot-
   test magician at the Bazaar to help bring a rarity to the
   public for a mere fraction of his normal fees. It shows
   he's something other than a cold-hearted businessman
   ... that he really cares about people."
  "So what's wrong with being a cold-hearted busi-
   nessman?" Aahz snorted. "How about the other guy?
   Everybody thinks he's a villain, and he's crying all the
   way to the bank. He retired on the profit from that one
   sale alone."

  "Unless Nanny misled me horribly when she taught
   me my numbers," Chumley interrupted, "I figure your
   current bankroll could eat that fellow's profit and still
   have room for lunch. Any reason you're so big on squir-
   reling away so much gold, Aahz? Are you planning on
  retiring?"
  "No, I'm not planning on retiring," my partner
   snapped. "And you're missing the point completely.
   Money isn't the object."
  "It isn't?"
  I think everybody grabbed that line at the same time
   ... even Pepe, who hadn't known Aahz all that long.
  "Of course not. You can always get more gold. What
   can't be replaced is time. We all know Skeeve here has a
   long way to go in the magic department. What the rest
   of you keep forgetting is how short a life span he has to
   play with... maybe a hundred years if he's lucky. All
   I'm trying to do is get him the maximum learning time
   possible... and that means keeping him from using up
   mos,t of his time on nickel-and-dime adventures. Let the
   smalltime operators do those. My partner shouldn't
   have to budge away from his studies unless the assign-
   ment is something really spectacular. Something that
   will advance his reputation and his career."
  There was a long silence while everybody digested
   that one, especially me. Since Aahz had accepted me as
   a full partner instead of an apprentice, I tended to for-
   get his role as my teacher and career manager. Thinking
   back now, I could see he had never really given up the
   work, just gotten sneakier. I wouldn't have believed
  that was possible.
  "How about this particular nickel-and-dime adven-
   ture?" Tananda said, breaking the silence. "You know,
   pulling your tail out of a scrape? Isn't this a little low-
   brow for the kind of legend you're trying to build?"
  The sarcasm in her voice was unmistakable, but it
  didn't phase Aahz in the least.
  "If you'll ask around, you'll find out that I didn't
   want him along on this jaunt at all. In fact, I knocked
   him cold trying to keep him out. A top-flight magician
   shouldn't have to stoop to bill collecting, especially
   when the risk is disproportionately high."
  "Well, it all sounds a little cold-blooded for my taste,
   Aahz," Chumley put in. "If you extend your logic, our
   young friend here is only going to work when the danger
   is astronomically high, and conversely if the advance-
   ment to his career is enough, no risk is too great. That
   sounds to me like a sure-fire way to lose a partner and a
   friend. Like the Geek says, if you keep bucking the
   odds, sooner or later they're going to catch up with
   you."
  My partner spun to confront the troll nose-to-nose.
  "Of course it's going to be dangerous," he snarled.
   "The magic profession isn't for the faint of heart, and
   to hit the top he's going to have to be hair-triggered and
   mean. There's no avoiding that, but I can try to be sure
   he's ready for it. Why do you think I've been so dead-
   set against him having bodyguards? If he starts relying
   on other people to watch out for him, he's going to lose
   the edge himself. That's when he's in danger of walking
   into a swinging door."
  That brought Guido into the fray.
  "Now let me see if I've got this right," my bodyguard
   said. "You don't want me and my cousin Nunzio
   around so that the Boss here can handle all the trouble
   himself? That's crazy talk, know what I mean? Now
   listen to me, 'cause this time I know what I'm sayin'.
   The higher someone gets on the ladder, the more folks
   come huntin' for his head. even if they don't do nothin'
   they got people gunning for them, 'cause they got power
   and respect and there's always somebody who thinks
   they can steal it. Now I've seen some of the Big Guys
   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   134
  Robert Asprin MYTH-ING PERSONS 135
  who try to act just like you're sayin'... they're so
   scared all the time they don't trust nothin' or nobody.
   The only one they can count on is themselves, and
   everybody else is suspect. That includes total strangers,
   their own bodyguards, their friends, and their partners.
   Think about that for a minute."
  He leaned back and surveyed the room, addressing
  his next comments to everyone.
  "People like that don't last long. They don't trust
   nobody, so they got nobody. Ya can't do everything
   alone and sooner or later they're lookin' the wrong way
   or asleep when they should be watchin' and it's all over.
   Now I've done a lot of jobs as a bodyguard, and they
   were just jobs, know what I mean? The Boss here is dif-
   ferent, and I'm not just sayin' that. He's the best man
   I've met in my whole life because he likes people and
   ain't afraid to show it. More important, he ain't afraid
   to risk his neck to help somebody even if it isn 't in his
   best interest. I work double hard for him because I
   don't want to see anything happen to him ... and if that
   means comin' along on weird trips like this, then that's
   the way it is. Anybody that wants to hurt him is gonna
   have to come through me ... and that includes fightin'
   any of you if you want to try to turn him into somethin'
   he isn't and doesn't want to be."
   Massha broke in with a loud clapping of her hands.
   "Bravo, Guido," she said. "I think your problem,
   Green and Scaly, is that your idea of success is out of
   step with everyone else's. We all want to see good things
   happen for Skeeve, here, but we also like him just the
   way he is. We've got enough faith in his good sense to
   back him in whatever move he makes in his develop-
   ment... without trying to frog-march or trick him up a
  specific path."
   Aahz not only gave ground before this onslaught of
  protest, he seemed to shrink in a little on himself.
  "I like him too," he mumbled. "I've known him
   longer than any of you, remember? He's doing fine, but
   he could be so much more. How can he choose a path if
   he can't see it? All I'm trying to do is set him up to be
   bigger than I ... than we could ever think of being
   ourselves. What's wrong with that?"
  Despite my irritation at having my life discussed as if
   I weren't in the room, I was quite touched, by my
   friends' loyal defense of me, and most of all by Aahz.
  "You know, partner," I said softly, "for a minute
   there, you sounded just like my father. He wanted me to
   be the best... or more specifically, to be better than he
   was. My mom always tried to tell me that it was because
   he loved me, but at that time it just sounded like he was
   always being critical. Maybe she was right... I'm more
   inclined to believe it today than I was then, but then
   again, I'm older now. If nothing else, I've had to try to
   tell people I love them when the words just won't come
   . .. and gotten upset with myself when they couldn't see
   it when I tried to show them.
  "Aahz, I appreciate your concern and I want your
   guidance. You're right, there are paths and options I
   can't even comprehend yet. But I also have to choose
   my own way. I want to be better eventually than I am
   today, but not necessarily the best. I think Guide's
   right, there's a big price tag attached to being at the top,
   and I'd want to think long and hard if I wanted to pay it
   ... even if I was convinced I could, which I'm not. I do
   know that if it means giving up the trust I have in you
   and everybody else in this room, I'll settle for being a
   nickel-and-dime operator. That price I'll never pay will-
   ingly."
  Silence started to descend again as each of us re-
   treated into his or her own thoughts, then the werewolf
   bounded into the middle of the assemblage.
  "But what is this, eh?" he demanded. "Surely this
   

   

   

   

   136
  Robert Asprin
  cannot be ze great team of Aahz and Skeeve, ze ones
   who can laugh at any dan-gair? "
  "You know, Pepe," Aahz said warningly, "you've
   got a great future as a stuffed head."
  "My head?" The werewolf blinked. "But she is not
   ... oohh. I see now. You make ze joke, eh? Good. Zat
  is more like it."
  "... and as far as laughing at danger goes," I joined
   in, determined to hold up my end of the legend, "the
   only danger I see here is dying of boredom. Where is
   Vilhelm anyway?"
  "I know you and Aahz are fond of each other,
   Skeeve," Chumley yawned, "but you've got to spend
   more time with other people. You're starting to sound
   like him. Maybe you can tag along the next time I have
   an assignment."
  "Over my dead body," my partner said. "Besides,
   what could he learn from a troll that I couldn't teach
  him myself?"
  "J could teach him not to catch birds for Deveels for
   ten gold pieces," the troll grinned, winking at his sister.
   "That seems to be a part of his education you've ne-
   glected."
  "Izzat so!" my partner bristled. "You're going to
   teach him about price setting? How about the time you
   set your own sister up to steal an elephant without
   bothering to check...."
  . And they were off again. As I listened, I found myself
   reflecting on the fact that while it was nice to know the
   depths of my friends' feelings about me, it was far more
   comfortable when they managed to conceal it under a
   cloak of banter. For the most part, open sincerity is
   harder to take than friendly laughter.
   

   




Chapter Sixteen:



   

   "Don't be fooled by appearances."
  —MALLOY
  THINGS were pretty much back to normal by the time
   Vilhelm returned with our disguises... which was a
   good thing as the process of masking-up proved to be a
   test of everybody's sense of humor.
  Until I had hooked up with Aahz, I had never had oc-
   casion to pretend I was anyone but myself. As such, I
   had no way of knowing how long it took to don a
   physical disguise without resorting to magic. By the time
   we were done, I had a new respect for the skills I had
   learned, not to mention a real longing for a dimension
   ... any dimension with a strong force line to work with.
  Tananda was a major help, her experiences with the
   assassin's guild came into play and she took the lead in
   trying to coach us into our new roles.
  "Guido, straighten up!" she commanded, exaspera-
   tion creeping into her voice. "You walk like a gang-
   ster."
  "I am a gangster!" my bodyguard snarled back.
  137
   

   

   

   

   138 Robert Asprin MYTH-ING PERSONS 139
  "Besides, what's wrong with the way I walk? It got us to
   the jail, didn't it?"
  "Half the town wasn't looking for you then," Ta-
   nanda argued. "Besides, then you could pick your own
   route. We don't know where the opposition's holed up.
   We're going to have to walk through crowds on this
   hunt, and that walk just doesn't make it. Ninety percent
   of costuming is learning to move like the character
   you're trying to portray. Right now you move like
   you're looking for a fight."
  "Try walking like Don Bruce," I suggested. "He's a
  gangster, too."
  That earned me a black look, but my bodyguard tried
   to follow my instructions, rising up on the balls of his
   feet and mincing along.
  "Better," Tananda said, leaving Guido prancing up
   and down the room with a scowl on his face.
  "How are we doing?"
  "Lousy," she confided in me. "This is taking a lot
   longer, than it should. I wish there were more mirrors in
   this place... heck, any mirrors would be nice."
  It hadn't been until we started gearing up that we real-
   ized the Dispatcher had no mirrors at all. He claimed
   they weren't popular or necessary among vampires.
   This left us with the unenviable job of checking each
   others' make-up and costumes, a chore which would
   have been Homeric even if less sensitive egos were in-
   volved.
  "How're my teeth?" Massha demanded, sticking her
   head in front of me and opening her mouth.
  It was like staring into the depths of an underground
  cave.
  "Umm ... the left side is okay, but you're still miss-
   ing a few on the right. Hang on a second and I'll give
   you a hand."
  Teeth were turning out to be a special problem. We
   had hoped to find some of the rubber fangs so prevalent
   in the Bazaar novelty stores to aid in our disguises. Un-
   fortunately, none of the shops in Blut had them. The
   closest thing they had in stock, according to Vilhelm,
   were rubber sets of human teeth designed to fit over
   fangs. The vampire assured us that locally they were
   considered quite frightening. Faced by this unforeseen
   shortage, we were resorting to using tooth-black to
   blacken all our teeth except the canines for a close ap-
   proximation of the vampires we were trying to imitate.
   When we tried it out, it wasn't a bad effect, but the ac-
   tual application was causing countless problems. When
   one tried to apply the stuff on oneself without a mirror,
   it was difficult to get the right teeth, and if one called on
   one's friends for assistance, one rapidly found that said
   friend was soon possessed by an overpowering impulse
   to paint one's tongue black instead of the teeth.
  "I don't like this cloak," Guido announced, grabbing
   my arm. "I want to wear my trench coat."
  "Vampires don't wear trench coats," I said firmly.
   "Besides, the cloak really looks great on you. Makes
   you look ... I don't know, debonair but menacing."
  "Yeah?" he retorted skeptically, craning his neck to
   try to see himself.
  "You think you've got problems?" Massha burst in.
   "Look at what I'm supposed to wear! I'll trade your
   cloak for this rig any day."
  As you might have noticed, the team was having more
   than a little difficulty adapting to their disguises.
   Massha in particular was rebelling against her costume.
  After having been floated over our escape like a bal-
   loon over a parade, we feared that she would be one of
   the most immediately recognizable of our group. As
   such, we not only dyed her garish orange hair, we in-
   

   

   

   

   140
  Robert Asprin
  sisted that her new costume cover as much of her as pos-
   sible. To this end, Vilhelm had found a dress he called a
   "moo-moo," a name which did nothing toward endear-
   ing the garment to my apprentice.
  "I mean, really. High Roller," she said, backing me
  toward a corner. "Isn't it bad enough that half the
   town's seen me as a blimp? Tell me I don't have to be a
  cow now."
  "Honest, Massha," Vilhelm put in. "The style is
  fairly popular here in Blut. A lot of the ladies wear it
   who are ... that is, are a bit...."
  "Fat!?"
  She loomed over the little vampire.
  "Is that the word you're groping for, Short and
  About To Become Extinct?"
  "Let's face it, dear," Tananda said, coming to the
   rescue. "You are carrying a little extra weight there.
   Believe me, if there's one time you can't kid yourself
   about your body, it's when you're donning costumes. If
   anything, that outfit makes you look a little slimmer."
  "Don't try to kid a kidder, sweetie," Massha sighed.
   "But you're right about the costuming thing. This thing
   is so drab, though. First I'm a blimp, and now I'm an
  army tent."
  "Now that I'll agree with," Tananda nodded. "Trust
  a man to find a drab mu-mu. Tell you what. There's a
   scarf I was going to use for a belt, but maybe you could
  wear it around your neck."
  I was afraid that last crack would touch off another
   explosion, but Massha took it as a helpful suggestion
   and the two of them went off in search of other possible
  adornments.
  "Got a minute, partner?"
   From the tone of Aahz's voice, I knew the moment I
  had been dreading had arrived.
  MYTH-ING PERSONS          141
  Chumley didn't have to worry about a disguise at all,
   as trolls were not uncommon in this dimension. Ta-
   nanda also insisted that she looked enough like a vam-
   pire to pass with only minimal modifications. I hadn't
   seen any vampires withgreen hair, but she claimed that
   she had, so, as always, I yielded to her greater ex-
   perience in these matters. I was also on the "minimal
   disguise" list, everyone agreeing that no one in Blut had
   gotten enough of a look at me to fix the image in their
   mind. While I wasn't wild about being so unmemorable,
   I went along with it ... especially when I saw what
   Guido and Massha were going through. The problems
   with those two notables have already been mentioned:
  troublesome, but not insurmountable. Then there was
   Aahz....
  "Is there something wrong?" I asked innocently.
  "You bet your dragon there's something wrong!" my
   partner snarled. "And don't try to play innocent with
   me! It didn't work when you were my apprentice, and it
   sure isn't going to work now."
  Aahz's disguise had presented us with some knotty
   problems. Not only was he the most wanted member of
   our party, he was also easily the most distinctive. After
   the trial and his time in jail, it was doubtful that there
   was a single citizen of Blut who wouldn't recognize him
   on sight. I mean, there just aren't that many scaly green
   demons wandering around any dimension... except
   possibly his home dimension of Perv. It was therefore
   decided... almost unanimously... that not only
   would we change my partner's color with make-up, but
   that it would also be necessary to change his sex.
  "Does this, perchance, have something to do with
   your disguise?" I inquired, trying to keep a straight
  face.
   "Yes, it has something to do with my disguise," he
  142
  Robert Asprin
  mimicked, "and, so help me, partner or no, if you let
   that smile get away, I'll punch your lights out. Under-
   stand?"
   With a great effort I sucked my cheeks in and bit my
  lower lip.
   "Seriously, though," he said, almost pleading, "a
  joke's a joke, but you don't really expect me to go out in
   public looking like this, do you?"
  In addition to the aforementioned make-up, Aahz's
   disguise required a dress and a wig. Because of the size
   of his head (a problem Vilhelm had wisely down-played
   as much as possible) the selection of wigs available had
   been understandably small. In fact, the only available in
   his size was a number called "Lady Go-GoDiva," which
   involved a high blonde beehive style offset by a long
   ponytail that hung down to his knees. Actually, the
   ponytail turned out to be a blessing in disguise, as the
   dark blue dress Vilhelm had selected for my partner
   turned out to have an exceptionally low neckline, and
   the hair draped over his shoulder helped hide the prob-
   lem we had had finding ample or suitable material to
  stuff his bosom with.
  "As my wise old mentor once told me when I was
  faced with a similar dilemma," I said sagely, "what
   does it matter what people think of you? They aren't
   supposed to know it's you, anyway. That's the whole
  idea of a disguise."
  "But this get-up is humiliating!"
  "My words precisely when someone else I could name
   deemed it necessary for me to dress up as a girl, remem-
   ber?"
  "You're enjoying this, aren't you?" Aahz glowered,
  peering at me suspiciously.
  "Well, there are a couple of other options," I ad-
   mitted.
  MYTH-ING PERSONS          143
  "That's more like it!" he grinned, reaching for his
   wig.
  "You could stay behind. ..."
  His hand stopped just short of its mission.
  "... or we could forget the whole thing and pay the
   fine ourselves."
  The hand retreated as my partner's shoulders sagged
   in defeat. I felt no joy at the victory. If anything, I had
   been half hoping he would be embarrassed enough to
   take me up on my suggestion of abandoning the project.
   I should have known better. When there's money in-
   volved, it takes more than embarrassment to throw
   Aahz off the scent....hether the embarrassment is his
   own or someone else's.
  "All right, everybody,"- I called, hiding my disap-
   pointment. "Are we ready to go?"
  "Remember your sunglasses!" Tananda added.
  That was the final touch to our disguises. To hide our
   non-red eyes, each of us donned a pair of sunglasses.
   Surveying the final result, I had to admit that aside from
   Tananda and Chumley, we didn't look like us. Exactly
   what we did look like I wouldn't venture to say, but we
   sure didn't look like usi
  "Okay," Aahz chimed in, his discomfort apparently
   behind him. "Does everyone have their marching
   orders? Vilhelm? Are you sure you can track us on that
   thing?"
  "No problem," the little vampire nodded. "When
   things get slow around here I use this rig to do a little
   window peeking right here in town. Covering the streets
   is even easier."
  "Remember," I told him, "watch for our signal.
   When we catch up with this Vic character, we're going
   to want you to get some responsible local witnesses there
   chop-chop."
  144
  Robert Asprin
  "Well now," Aahz grinned evilly, "you don't have to
   be too quick about it. I wouldn't mind having a little
   time alone with him before we turn him over to the
  authorities."
  My heart sank a little. Aahz sounded determined to
   exact a bit of vengeance out of this hunt, and I wasn't at
   all sure he would restrict himself to Vic when it came
   time to express his ire.
  I think Tananda noticed my concern.
  "Ease up a little, Aahz," she said casually. "I don't
   mind helping you out of a tight spot, but count me out
   when it comes to excessive force for the sake of venge-
   ance. It lacks class."
  "Since when did you worry about excessive vio-
   lence?" Aahz growled, then shrugged his acceptance.
   "Okay. But maybe we'll get lucky. Maybe he'll resist ar-
   rest."
  I was still worried, but realized that that was about
  the most restraint I would get out of my partner.
  ."Now that that's settled," I said, producing Lu-
   anna's scarf, "Pepe, take a whiff of this."
  "Enchanting," he smiled, nuzzling the piece of cloth.
   "A young lady, no? Eef ze body is as good as ze aroma,
   I will follow her to the end of ze world whether you ac-
   company me or not."
  I resisted an impulse to wrap the scarf around his
  neck and pull.
  "All right, everybody," I said, retrieving the scarf
   and tucking it back into my tunic in what I hoped was a
   casual manner. "Let's go catch us a renegade vampire."
   

   




Chapter Seventeen:



   

   "The trail's got to be 'round here some-
   where!"
  —D. BOONE
  IT was only a few hours short of sunset as we set out on
   our quest, a nagging reminder of exactly how long our
   efforts at physical disguise had taken. We had agreed to
   avoid following Pepe as a group so as not to attract at-
   tention. Instead, we moved singly or in groups of two,
   using both sides of the street and deliberately walking at
   different paces. The faster walkers averaged their prog-
   ress with the slower by occasionally stopping to look
   into shop windows, thereby keeping our group together
   without actually appearing to. Tananda pointed out
   that not only would this procedure lessen our chances of
   being noticed, but also that it would maximize our
   chances for at least some of the group's escape if one of
   us should be discovered ... a truly comforting thought.
  Even though Luanna had claimed to have been
   watching for us at the Dispatcher's, it had been so long
   ago I fully expected her scent would have long since
   dissipated or at least been masked by the passage of
  145
   

   

   

   

   146
  MYTH-ING PERSONS          147
  Robert Asprin
  numerous others. As such, I was moderately surprised
   when the werewolf signaled almost immediately that he
   had found the trail and headed off with a determined
   air. Either her scent was stronger than I had thought, or
   I bad grossly underestimated Pepe's tracking ability.
  The trail wound up and down the cobblestoned
   streets, and we followed as quickly as we could without
   abandoning our pretense of being casual strollers who
   did not know each other. For a while, our group made
   up the majority of the beings visible, causing me to
   doubt the effectiveness of our ruse, but soon the vam-
   pires began to emerge to indulge their taste for the
   nightlife and we became much less obvious.
  I was paired up with Chumley, but the troll was
   strangely quiet as we made our way along. At first I
   thought he was simply concentrating on keeping the
   werewolf in sight, but as time wore on, I found the
   silence somehow unnerving. I had always respected
   Chumley as being one of the saner, leveler heads among
   our motley assemblage, and I was starting to have an
   uneasy impression that he was not wholeheartedly be-
   hind this venture.
  "Is there something bothering you, Chumley?" I
  asked at last.
  "Hmmm? Oh. Not really, Skeeve. I was just think-
   ing."
  "About that?"
  The troll let out a small sigh.
  "I was just contemplating our adversary, this Vic
   fellow. You know, from what's been said, he's quite
   resourceful in a devious sort of way."
  That took me a little aback. So far I had considered
   our vampire foe to be everything from an annoyance to
   a nemesis. The idea of studying his methods had never
   entered my mind.
  "What leads you to that conclusion?"
  The troll pursed his lips as he organized his thoughts.
  "Consider what he's accomplished so far. The entire
   time we've known of him, he's been on the run... first
   from the Deveels, and then from Aahz, who's no slouch
   'Sti^wnn.ing people once he sets his mind to it. Now,
   assuming for the moment that Vic is actually the brains
   of the group, he was quick enough to take advantage of
   being left alone in your waiting room to escape out the
   back door. He couldn't have planned that in advance,
   even knowing about the door. He probably had some
   other plan in mind, and formulated this new course of
   action on the spot."
  We paused for a moment to let a small group of vam-
   pires cross the intersection in front of us.
  "Now, that would have sufficed for an escape in most
   instances, but they happened to pick an exit route that
   left you and Aahz responsible, which set your partner
   on their trail," Chumley continued. "With nothing to
   go on but your reputations. Vic not only correctly
   deduced that he would be followed, but he also man-
   aged to spot Aahz's weakness and exploit it to frame
   him and make it stick... again, not the easiest task,
   particularly realizing it involved convincing and coach-
   ing his two accomplices in their roles."
  All of this was doing nothing for my peace of mind. I
   was having enough difficulty forcing myself to believe
   that we were really hunting a vampire, the sort of crea-
   ture 1 normally avoid at all costs, without having to deal
   with the possibility that he was shrewd and resourceful
   as well. Still, I had learned that ignoring unpleasant
   elements of a caper was perhaps the worst way to pre-
   pare for them.
  "Keep going," I urged.
  "Well," the troll sighed, "when you stumbled on his
   

   

   

   

   148
  Robert Asprin
  hiding place at the Woof Writers, he didn't panic. He
   waited to hear as much of your plans as possible, all the
   while taking advantage of the opportunity to assess you
   first-hand, then timed his escape so as to catch you all
  flat-footed."
   I digested this distasteful addition to the rapidly
  growing data file. "Do you really think he was sizing me
  up?"
  "There's no doubt in my mind. Not only was he
  gauging your skills and determination, he was successful
   enough at second-guessing you, based on the results of
   his studies, to be waiting to sound the alarm when you
   busted Aahz out of jail. ... a particularly bold move
   when one realizes that he was running the risk of being
   recognized, which would have blown his frame-up of
  your partner."
  "Bold or desperate," I said thoughtfully. "That's
   probably why he waited until we had actually sprung
   Aahz and were on the way down before he blew the
   whistle. If we had gotten away unscathed, then the
   frame would be useless, so at that point he really wasn't
  risking anything."
  "Have it your way," the troll shrugged. "The final
  analysis remains that we have one tough nut to crack.
   One can only wonder what he will do when we catch up
  with him this time."
  "If he's performing up to par, it could be rough on
  us."
  Chumley shot me a sidelong glance.
  "Actually, I was thinking it could be rough on your
   lady fair ... if he has managed to observe the feelings
  you have for her."
  I started to protest, then the impact of his theory hit
  me and my embarrassment gave way to concern.
  "Is it really that apparent? Do you think he could
  MYTH-ING PERSONS          149
  spot it? If so, he might already have done something to
   Luanna for having contacted us."
  "It stands out all over you to anyone who knows
   you," Chumley said, shaking his head. "As for some-
   one watching you for the first time ... I just don't
   know. He'd be more likely to deduce it from the in-
   formation you had... such as his name. That kind of
   data had to come from somewhere, though there's an
   outside chance that with your current reputation he'll
   assume that you gleaned it by some magical source."
  I barely heard him. My mind was focused on the
   possibility that Luanna might be hurt, and that I might
   indirectly have been the cause. A black well of guilt was
   rising up to swallow me, when I felt a hand on my
   shoulder.
  "Don't tune out now, Skeeve," Chumley was saying,
   shaking me slightly. "First of all, we're going to need
   you shortly. Secondly, even if Vic's figured out that
   you're in love with her, I don't think he'll have hurt her.
   If anything, he'll save her for a trump card to use
   against us."
  I drew a deep ragged breath.
  "... and he'll be just the bastard to do it, too," I
   said. "I don't know what I'll be able to do, for us or for
   her, but I'll be ready to try. Thanks, Chumley."
  The troll was studying me closely.
  "Actually, I wasn't thinking that he was such a
   blighter," he said. "More like a clever, resourceful per-
   son who's gotten in over his head and is trying his best
   to ad-lib his way out. Frankly, Skeeve old boy, in many
   ways he reminds me of you. You might think about that
   when attempting to appraise his likely courses of action
   and how to counter them."
  I tried again to weigh what he was saying, but all I
   could think about was what the consequences of this
  150
  Robert Asprin
  hunt could mean to Luanna. It was difficult enough for
   me to accept that we would have to force Luanna and
   her cohorts to answer to the authorities for their in-
   discretions, but the thought of placing her in physical
  danger was unbearable.
  I looked around for Aahz, fully intending to put an
   end to this hunt once and for all. To my surprise, the
   rest of the group was assembled on the corner ahead,
   and my partner was beckoning us to join them.
   "What's going on?" I asked, almost to myself.
   "Just off-hand," Chumley replied, "I'd say we've
  reached our destination."
   A cold wave of fear washed over me, and I hurried to
  the rendezvous with Chumley close behind.
  "We're in luck," Aahz announced as I arrived.
   "Guido here says he saw Vic entering the building just
   as we got here. It's my guess they're all inside right
  now."
  "Aahz, I—I want us to quit right now," I blurted,
  painfully aware of how weak it sounded.
  "Oh?" my partner said, cocking an eyebrow at me.
  . "Any particular reason?"
  I licked my lips, feeling the eyes of the whole group
  on me.
  "Only one. I'm in love with one of the fugitives...
  the girl."
  "Yeah. Now tell me something I didn't know," Aahz
  smirked, winking at me.
  "You knew?"
  "All of us knew. In fact, we were just discussing it.
   Remember, we all know you... and me probably best
   of all. It's already been pretty much decided to let your
   love-light go. Think of it as a present from us to you.
  The other two are ours."
   Five minutes ago, that would have made me deliri-
   

   

   MYTH-ING PERSONS          151
  ously happy. Now, it only seemed to complicate things.
  "But Chumley was just saying that there's a chance
   they might hurt her if they find out she helped us," I ex-
   plained desperately. "Can't we just let them all go?"
  "Not a chance, partner," Aahz said firmly. "In addi-
   tion to our original reasons, you've just mentioned the
   new one. Your girlfriend could be in trouble, and the
   only way to be sure she's safe is to remove her partners
   .. .Fast."
  "Believe him, Skeeve," Tananda urged. "It may not
   be nice, but it's the best way."
  "Really, Boss," Guido said quietly. "Unless we fin-
   ish this thing here and now, you're never goin' to know
   if she's safe, know what I mean?"
  That almost made sense, but I was still worried. "I
   don't know, Aahz. ..."
  "Well I do," my partner snapped. "And the longer
   we stand down here, the more chance there is that
   they'll either get away or set up a trap. If you're uncer-
   tain, stay down here ... in fact, that's not a bad idea.
   Massha, you stay down here with him in case they try to
   bolt out this way. While you're waiting, watch for the
   witnesses that Vilhelm's supposed to be sending along.
   Tananda, you and Chumley and Guido come along with
   me. This is a job for experienced hard-cases. Pepe, we
   appreciate your help, but this isn't really your fight."
  "But of course." The werewolf grinned. "Besides, I
   am a lo-var, not a figh-tar. I will wait here to see the
   finale, eh?"
  "But Aahz.. .."
  "Really, partner, you'll be more help down here. This
   isn't your kind of fight, and we need someone to deal
   with the witnesses. You're good at that kind of thing."
  "I was going to ask if you had given the signal to
   Vilhelm."
  152              Robert Asprin
  "S'ignal?" Aahz blinked. "How's this for a signal?!"
  With that, he tore off his wig and threw it on the
   ground, followed closely by his dress.
  "Think he'll get the message? Besides, no way am I
   going to try to fight in that get-up."
  "Now you're talkin'!" Guido crowed.
  In a flash he had discarded his cloak and was pulling
   on his now-familiar trench coat.
  "Where did that come from?" I demanded.
  "Had it with me all the time," the bodyguard said
   smugly. "It would have been like leaving an old friend
  behind."
  "Well, if you and your old friend are ready," Ta-
  nanda murmured, "we'd better get started.
  "Itching for action?" Aahz grinned.
  "No. More like eager to get off the street," she said.
   "Since you boys have shown your true colors, we're
  starting to draw a crowd."
  Sure enough, the vampires on the street had ceased
   whatever they had been doing before and were gathering
   in knots, whispering together and pointing at our group.
  "Umm... we'd better finish this fast," Aahz said,
   shooting a nervous glance around. "All right, gang.
  Let's go for the gusto!"
  "Go for the what?" I asked, but they were already on
  their way into the building.
  I noticed they were all moving faster than normal. I
   also noticed that Massha, Pepe, and I were the only
   ones left on the street... and now the crowd was point-
   ing at us!
   

   




Chapter Eighteen:



   

   "I didn't come all this way to sit out the
   fight!"
  —R. BALBOA
  "WHAT'S going on?"
  I looked around to find that one of the vampires had
   detached himself from his group of friends and was ad-
   dressing me directly.
  "Beats me," Massha interceded. "A bunch of off-
   worlder types just took off into that building with blood
   in their eyes. I'm waiting to see what happens next."
  "Far out," the vampire breathed, peering toward the
   structure. "I haven't seen that many off-worlders in one
   place except in the flickers. Wasn't one of them that
   escaped murderer, Aahz?"
  I really didn't want this character to join our little
   group. While our disguises seemed to be holding up
   under casual inspection, I was pretty sure that pro-
   longed close scrutiny would reveal not only the non-
   local nature of Massha and myself, but also the fact that
   we were trying to hide it.
  "You may be right," I said, playing a hunch. "If so,
  153
  Robert Asprin
  154
  it's a good thing you happened along. We're going to
   need all the help we can get."
  "Help? Help for what?"
  "Why to catch the murderer, of course. We can't let
   him get away again. I figure it's our duty to stop him
   ourselves or at least slow him up until the authorities ar-
   rive."
  "We? You mean the three of you? You're going to
  try to stop a murderer all by yourselves?"
  "Four of us now that you're here."
  The vampire started backing away.
  "Ummm... actually I've got to get back to my
   friends. We're on our way to a party. Sorry I can't help,
   but I'll spread the word that you're looking for vol-
   unteers, okay?"
  "Hey, thanks," I called as if I believed him. "We'll
  be right here."
  By the time I had finished speaking, he had disap-
   peared into the crowd. Mission accomplished.
  "Nicely done, my friend," Pepe murmured. "He
   does not, how you say, want to get involved, no?"
  "That's right," I said, my eyes "on the building again.
   "And to tell you the truth, I'm not too wild about the
   idea either. What do you think, Massha? It's awfully
  quiet in there."
  "I'll say," my apprentice agreed. "I'm just trying to
   figure out if that's a good or a bad sign. Another ten
   minutes and I'm heading in there to check it out my-
   self."
  I nodded my consent, even though I doubted she saw
   it. We both had our eyes glued to the building, mem-
   orizing its every detail.
  It was a four-story structure ... or it would be if it
   weren't for the curved peak that jutted out from the
   roof fully half-again as high as the main building. It
  MYTH-ING PERSONS          155
  looked as if the builder had suddenly added the adorn-
   ment in a last-minute attempt to have his work stand as
   tall or taller than its neighbors. From the number of
   windows in the main structure, I guessed it was an
   apartment building or a hotel or something. In short, it
   looked like it had a lot of little rooms. I found myself
   wondering exactly how our strike force was supposed to
   locate their target without kicking in every door in the
   place ... a possibility I wouldn't put past Aahz.
  I was about to express this fear to Massha when a
   loud crash sounded from within.
  "What was that?" I demanded of no one in par-
   ticular.
  "Sounded like a loud crash," my apprentice supplied
   helpfully.
  I forced myself to remember 'that no one out here
   knew any more about what was going on inside than I
   did.
  After the crash, everything was quiet once more. I
   tried to tell myself that the noise might have nothing at
   all to do with the strike force, but I didn't believe it for a
   minute. The crowd was talking excitedly to each other
   and straining to see the various windows. They seemed
   quite confident that something else would happen soon,
   much more than I, but then again, maybe as city dwel-
   lers they were more accustomed to such vigils than I.
   Suddenly, Tananda appeared in the doorway.
   "Did they come out this way?" she called.
   "No one's been in or out since you went in," I re-
   sponded.
  She swore and started to re-enter the building.
   "What happened?" I shouted desperately.
   "We nailed one of them, but Vic got away. He's loose
   in the building somewhere, and he's got the girl with
   him."
  156 Robert Asprin
  MYTH-ING PERSONS
  157
  With that, she disappeared before I could make any
   further inquiries.
  Terrific.
  "Exciting, eh?" Pepe said. "I tell you, I could watch
   such a chase for hours."
  "Well, I can't," I snapped. "I've had it with sitting
   on the sidelines. Massha? I'm going in there. Want to
   come?"
  "I dunno. Hot Stuff. I'd like to, but somebody
   should be here to plug this escape route."
  "Fine. You wait here, and I'll...."
  I turned to enter the building and bumped headlong
   intoVilhelm.
  "What are you doing here?" I demanded, not really
   caring.
  The Dispatcher shook his head slightly to clear it.
   Being smaller, he had gotten the worse ofour collision.
  "I'm here with the witnesses, remember? I was sup-
   posed to bring them."
  , "You were supposed to send them. Oh well, where
   are they?"
  "Right here," he said, gesturing to a sullen group of
   vampires standing behind him. "This is Kirby, and
   Paul, and Richard, and Adele, and Scott... some of
   the most respected citizens in town. Convince them and
   you're home free."
  Looking at the group, I suddenly realized how Aahz
   had ended up on death row. If the jury had been any-
   thing like these specimens, they would have hung their
   own mothers for jaywalking. While I didn't relish the
   thought of trying to convince them of anything, I found
   myself being very glad I didn't have to deal with them
   on a regular basis.
  "Okay. So we're here," the one identified as Kirby
   growled. "Just what is it we're supposed to be wit-
   

   

   nessing? If this is one of your cockamamie deals, Vil-
   helm...."
  I interrupted simply by taking my sunglasses off and
   opening my eyes wide, displaying their whites. The bad
   reputation of humans in this dimension was sufficient to
   capture their undivided attention.
  "Perhaps you recall a certain murder trial that took
   place not too long ago?" I said, trying to work the
   toothblack off with my tongue. "Well, the convicted
   murderer who escaped is my partner, and right now he's
   inside that building. He and a few of our friends are
   about to show you one surprisingly lively corpse...
   specifically the fellow that my partner is supposed to
   have killed. I trust that will be sufficient to convince you
   of his innocence?"
  While the vampires were taken aback by my presence
   in their midst, they recovered quickly. Like I said, they
   were real hard cases and didn't stay impressed very
   long.
  "So how much time is this going to take?" Kirby said
   impatiently. "I'm giving up my sleep for this, and I
   don't get much of it."
  That was a good question, so, not having an answer, I
   stalled.
  "You sleep nights? I thought...."
  "I'm a day owl," the vampire waved. "It's easier to
   get my work done when the phone isn't ringing every
   five minutes... which usually means waiting until
   everyone else is asleep. But we're getting off the subject.
   The bottom line is that my time is valuable, and the
   same holds true for my colleagues. If you think we're
   going to just stand around here until...."
  There was a sudden outcry from the crowd, and we all
   looked to find them talking excitedly and pointing up at
   the roof.
   

   

   

   

   158
  Robert Asprin
  A figure had emerged, fighting to pick his way across
   the steeply sloped surface while dragging a struggling
   girl by one arm.
  Vic!
  This was the first time I had gotten a clear look at my
   foe, and I was moderately surprised. He was younger
   than I had expected, barely older than myself, and in-
   stead of a menacing cloak, he was sporting a white
   turtleneck and sunglasses. It suddenly occurred to me
   that if sunglasses enabled me to pass for a vampire, that
   they would also let a vampire pass undetected among
  humans.
   The vampire suddenly stopped as his path was barred
  by Tananda, who appeared as if by magic over the
   edge of the roof. He turned to retrace his steps, only to
   find that the trio of Aahz, Guido, and Chumley had
   emerged behind him, cutting off his retreat.
  "I believe, gentlemen and lady, that up there is the
   elusive body that started this whole thing," I heard
   myself saying. "If you can spare a few more moments, I
   think my colleagues will have him in custody so that you
   might interrogate him at your leisure."
  "Don't be too sure of that. High Roller," Massha
   cautioned. "Look!"
  His chosen routes of escape cut off. Vic was now
   scrabbling up the roof peak itself, Luanna hanging in
   his grip. While I had to admire his strength, I was a. a
   loss to understand what he was trying to accomplish
   with the manuever. It was obvious that he had been ex-
   posed, so why didn't he just give it up?
  The answer became apparent in the next few mo-
   ments. Reaching the apex of the roof, the vampire
   underwent a chilling metamorphosis. Before the strike
   force could reach him, he hunched forward and huge
  MYTH-ING PERSONS
  159
  batwings began to grow and spread from his back. His
   plans gone awry, he was getting ready to escape.
  In immediate response to his efforts, Tananda and
   Guido both produced projectile weapons and shouted
   something to him. Though the distance was too great to
   make out the words clearly, it was obvious to me that
   they were threatening to shoot him down if he tried to
   take to the air.
  "We may have a murder case yet," Kirby murmured,
   squinting to watch the rooftop drama unfold.
  "Murder?" I exclaimed, turning on him. "How can
   you call it murder if they're only trying to keep from
   escaping your justice? "
  "That wasn't what I meant," the vampire said, never
   taking his eyes from the action. "Check it out."
  I looked ... and my heart stood still.
  Aahz had been trying to ease up the roof peak closer
   to Vic and his hostage. Vic must have seen him, because
   he was now holding Luanna out over the drop as he
   pointed an angry finger at my partner. The threat was
   unmistakable.
  "You know, eet is people like zat who give ze vam-
   pires a bad name, eh?" Pepe said, nudging me.
  I ignored him, lost in my own anxiety and frustration
   at the stalemated situation. A noticeably harder jab
   from Massha broke my reverie, however.
  "Hey, Hot Stuff. Do you see what I see?"
  I tore my gaze away from the confrontation and shot
   a glance her way. She was standing motionless, her
   brow furrowed with concentration and her eyes closed.
  It took me a few moments to realize what she was
   doing, then I followed suit, scarcely daring to hope.
  There it was! A force line! A big, strong, beautiful,
   glorious force line.
  160 Robert Asprin
  I had gotten so used to not having any magical energy
   at my disposal in this dimension that I hadn't even
   bothered to check!
  I opened myself to the energy, relished it for a fleet
   moment, then rechanneled it.
  "Excuse me," I said with a smile, handing my sun-
   glasses to Kirby. "It's about time I took a hand in this
   directly."
  With that, I reached out with my mind, pushed off
   against the ground, and soared upward, setting a course
   for the cornered vampire on the roof.
   

   




Chapter Nineteen:



   

   "All right, pilgrim. This is between you and
   me!"
  —A. HAMILTON
  I had hoped to make my approach unobserved, but as I
   flew upward, the crowd below let out a roar that drew
   the attention of the combatants on the roof. Terrific!
   When I wanted unobtrusive, I got notoriety.
  Reaching a height level with that of the vampire, I
   hovered at a discreet distance.
  "Put away the nasties," I called to Tananda and
   Guido. "He's not getting away by air."
  They looked a bit rebellious, but followed the order.
  "What's with the Peter Pan bit, partner?" Aahz
   shouted. "Are you feeling your Cheerioats, or did you
   finally find a force line?"
  "Both." I waved back, then turned my attention to
   Vic.
  Though his eyes were obscured by his sunglasses, I
   could feel his hateful glare burning into me to the bone.
   "Why don't you just call it quits?" I said in what I
  161
   

   

   

   

   162 Robert Asprin MYTH-ING PERSONS 163
  hoped was a calm, soothing tone. "It's over. We've got
   you outflanked."
  For a moment he seemed to waiver with indecision.
   Then, without warning, he threw Luanna at Aahz.
  "Why can't you all just leave me alone!" he
   screamed, and dove off the roof.
  Aahz somehow managed to snag the girl's hurtling
   form, though in the process he lost his balance and
   tumbled backward down the roof peak, cushioning the
   impact with his own body.
  I hesitated, torn between the impulse to check on
   Luanna's welfare and the desire to pursue Vic.
  "Go get him!" my partner called. "We're fine!"
  That was all the encouragement I needed. Wheeling
   to my right, I plunged after the fleeing vampire,
  What followed was one of the more interesting ex-
   periences of my limited magical career. As I mentioned
   before, my form of flying magically isn't really flying
   ... it's controlled levitation of oneself. This made en-
   thusiastic pursuit a real challenge to my abilities. To
   counterbalance the problem, however, Vic couldn't
   really fly either'... at least he never seemed to flap his
   wings. Instead, he appeared content to soar and bank
   and catch an occasional updraft. This forced him to
   continually circle and double back through roughly the
   same area time and time again. This suited me fine, as I
   didn't want to wander too far away from my energizing
   force line now that I had found it. The idea of running
   out of power while suspended fifty feet in the air did not
   appeal to me at all.
  Anyway, our aerial duel rapidly became a curious
   matching of styles with Vic's swooping and circling in
   his efforts to escape and my vertical and horizontal
   maneuverings to try to intercept him. Needless to say,
   the conflict was not resolved quickly. As soon as I
  would time a move that came close enough to an in-
   terception to justify attempting it again. Vic would
   realize his danger and alter his pattern, leaving me to try
   to puzzle out his new course.
  The crowd loved it.
  They whooped and hollered, their words of en-
   couragement alternately loud and faint as we changed
   altitude. It was impossible to tell which of us they were
   cheering for, though for a while I thought it was me,
   considering the approval they had expressed when I first
   took off to join the battle. Then I noticed that the crowd
   was considerably larger than it had been when I entered
   the fray, and I realized that many of them had not been
   around to witness the beginning of the conflict. To
   them, it probably appeared that a monster from another
   dimension was chasing one of their fellow beings
   through the sky.
  That thought was disquieting enough that I spared
   some of my attention to scan the surrounding rooftops
   on the off-chance that a local sniper might be preparing
   to help his fellow countryman. It turned out to be the
   wisest decision I had made.
  As I was looking over my shoulder, I plowed full
   force into Vic, who had doubled back on his own path.
   The feint would have probably worked if I had seen it,
   but as it was we collided at maximum speed, the impact
   momentarily stunning us both. I managed to grab a
   double handful of the vampire's turtleneck as we fell
   about ten feet before I adjusted my levitation strength
   to support us both.
  "What's the matter with you!" I demanded, trying to
   shake him, which succeeded only in moving us both
   back and forth in the air. "Running away won't help."
  Then I realized he was crying.
  Somehow, this struck me as immensely unfair. I

  mean, how are you supposed to stay mad at a villain
   that cries? Okay. So I'm a soft tough. But the crying
   really did make a difference.
  "I can't fight you all!" he sobbed, tears streaming
   down his cheeks. "Maybe if I knew some magic I could
   take one of you with me ... but at least you're going to
   have to work for your kill!"
  With that he tore loose from my grasp and swooped
   away.
  His words stunned me so much I almost let him es-
   cape. Fortunately, I had the presence of mind to call out
   to him.
  "Hey, dummy! Nobody's trying to kill you!"
  "Yeah, sure," he shouted back. "You're up here just
   for the fun of it."
  He was starting to bank toward the street, and I knew
   I'd only have time for one more try.
  "Look! Will you stop running if I quit chasing you? I
   think there's a major misunderstanding here."
  He glanced back over his shoulder and saw that I was
   still where I was when we collided. Altering his course
   slightly, he flared his wings and landed on a carved gar-
   goyle ornament jutting out from the side of the build-
   ing.
  "Why should you want to talk?" he called, wiping his
   face with one hand. "I thought nothing I could say
   would change your mind."
  "You'd be surprised," I shouted back. "Say, do you
   mind if I land on that ledge near you? I feel pretty silly
   just hanging here."
  He glanced at the indicated ledge, and I could see his
   wings flex nervously.
  "C'mon," I urged. "I'll be further away from you
   there than I was when we started this chase back on the
  roof. You'll still have a clean shot at getting away if I try
   anything."
  He hesitated, then nodded his consent.
  Moving slowly so as not to alarm him, I maneuvered
   my way to my new perch. Truth to tell, I was glad to get
   something solid under my feet again. Even using magic,
   flying can take a lot out of you, and I was relieved to get
   a chance to rest. Now that I was closer, I could see that
   Vic was breathing heavily himself. Apparently his form
   of flying was no picnic either.
  "All right," I said in a much more conversational
   tone. "Let's take this thing from the top. Who says
   we're trying to kill you?"
  "Matt does," the vampire responded. "He's the one
   who filled me in on you and your pet demon. To be
   honest with you, I had never even heard of you until
   Matt explained whose home we had stumbled into."
  "Matt?" I frowned.
  Then I remembered. Of course. The third member of
   the fugitive party. Luanna's old con artist partner who
   nobody had been paying attention to at all. A germ of
   an idea began to form in my head.
  "And he says we're out to kill you?"
  "That's right. According to him nobody crosses the
   Great Skeeve or makes a fool of him and lives... and
   using your house as an escape route definitely quali-
   fies."
  The reputation thing again. I was beginning to realize
   why so many magicians preferred to lead the lives of
   recluses.
  "That's crazy, Vic." I said. "If I tried to kill every-
   body who's made a fool of me, I'd be armpit-deep in
   corpses."
  "Oh yeah?" he shot back. "Well. if you aren't out to
   

   

   

   

   166 Robert Asprin MYTH-ING PERSONS 167
  kill me, why did you send your pet demon after us?"
  Despite my resolve to settle this thing amicably, I was
   starting to get annoyed.
  "First of all, he's not my pet demon. He's my partner
   and his name is Aahz. Secondly, I didn't send him. He
   knocked me out cold and came himself. Third and final,
   he was never out to kill you. He was trying to bring you
   and your cohorts back to Deva so we wouldn't get stuck
   paying off the people you swindled plus a hefty fine.
   Are you getting all this, or am I going too fast for you?"
  "But I didn't swindle anybody," the vampire pro-
   tested. "Those two offered me a job helping them sell
   magic charms. I didn't know they weren't genuine until
   Matt said the customers were mad and we had to run. I
   suggested we hide out here because it's the only place I
   know besides the Bazaar."
  "Uh-huh," I said, studying the sky. "Next you'll be
   saying you didn't frame my partner or sound the alarm
   on us when we tried to spring him."
   , Vic's wings dropped as he hung his head.
  "That much I can't deny... but I was scared! I
   framed the demon because it was the .only way I could
   think of to get him off our trail for a while. I really
   thought he could get loose on his own, and when I saw
   you at the Woof Writers', I knew he was going to get
   away. I sounded the alarm hoping you would all get
   caught and be detained long enough to give us a head
   start. Looking back on it, they were pretty ratty things
   to do, but what would you do if you had a pack of killer
   demons on your trail?"
  Now that I could identify with. Chumley's words
   about Vic and I being alike echoed in my ears. I had had
   to improvise in some pretty hairy situations myself.
  "Wait a minute!" I growled. "Speaking of killer de-
   mons, what was that bit with you dangling Luanna over
  the edge of the building back there?"
  "I was bluffing," the vampire shrugged. "Your
   friends were threatening to shoot me if I tried to fly
   away, and it was the only thing I could think of to try to
   get them to back off. I wouldn't deliberately hurt any-
   one... especially Luanna. She's sweet. That's why I
   was trying to help her escape with me after they caught
   Matt."
  That brought me to the question that had been nag-
   ging at my mind since I started this wild chase.
  "If you don't mind me asking, why didn't you just
   change into mist and drift away? We could never have
   caught you then."
  Vic gave a short, bitter laugh.
  "Do you know how rough it is to turn into mist?
   Well, you're a magician. Maybe you do know. Anyway,
   you might as well know the truth. I'm not much in the
   magic department... in fact, I'm pretty much a bust as
   a vampire. I can't even change all the way into a bat!
   These wings are the best I've been able to do. That's
   why I was looking for a new life in the Bazaar. I'd
   rather be a first-class anything than a third-rate vam-
   pire. I mean, I don't even like blood!"
  "You should meet my bodyguard." I grinned despite
   myself. "He's a gangster who's allergic to garlic."
  "Garlic? I love garlic."
  I opened my mouth to offer him Guido's job, then
   shut it rapidly. If this character was half as desperate as
   he sounded, he'd probably take the offer seriously and
   accept, and then where would I be? All we needed to
   complete our menagerie was a magic-poor vampire.
  "Well," I said instead, "I guess that answers all my
   questions except one. Now that you know we aren't try-
   ing to kill you, are you ready to quit running and face
   the music?"

  The vampire gnawed his lower lip as he thought.
  "You're sure it will be all right?"
  "I can't say for sure until I talk to my partner," I ad-
   mitted, "but I'm pretty sure things will be amenable.
   The main problem is to get the murder charges against
   him dropped... which I think we've already accom-
   plished. As for you, I think the only thing they could
   have against you is false arrest, and there's no way Aahz
   will press charges on that one."
  "Why not?"
  I gave him my best grin.
  "Because if he did, we couldn't take you back to
   Deva to deal with the swindling charge. Believe me, if
   given a chance between revenge and saving money, you
   can trust Aahz to be forgiving every time."
  Vic thought about it for a few more moments, then
   shrugged.
  "Embarrassment I'm used to dealing with, and I
   think I can beat the swindling rap. C'mon, Skeeve. Let's
   get this thing over with."
  Having finally reached a truce, however temporary,
   we descended together to face the waiting crowd.

  If you deduce from all this that we were back at our
   place on Deva, you're right. After some long, terse con-
   versations with the citizens of Blut and fond farewells to
   Vilhelm and Pepe, our whole crew, including our three
   captives, had trooped back to the castle and through the
   door without incident.
  I had hoped to have a few moments alone with Lu-
   anna, but, after several attempts, the best I had been
   able to manage was this conversation in the reception
   room under the watchful eyes of Aahz and Matt.
  Matt, incidentally, turned out to be a thoroughly
   unpleasant individual with a twisted needle-nose, acne,
   a receding hairline, and the beginnings of a beer-belly.
   For the life of me, I couldn't figure out what Luanna
   saw in him.
  "But that was when you thought he was in a jam," I
   said, resuming the argument. "Aahz and I have already
   promised to help defend him and Vic when they go
   before the Merchants Association. There's no need to
   stand by him yourself.''
  "I don't understand you, Skeeve," Luanna declared,
   shaking her head. "If I wouldn't leave Matt when he
   was in trouble, why should I leave him when things look
   like they're going to turn out okay? I know you don't
   like him, but he's done all right by me so far ... and I
   still owe him for getting me away from the farm."
  "But we're making you a good offer," I tried again
   desperately. "You can stay here and work for Aahz and
   me, and if you're interested we could even teach you
   some real magic so you don't have to...."
  She stopped me by simply laying a hand on my arm.
  "I know it's a good offer, Skeeve, and it's nice of you
   to make it. But for the time being I'm content to stay
   with Matt. Maybe sometime in the future, when I have
   a little more to offer you in return, I'll take you up on it
  ... if the deal's still open."
   "Well," I sighed, "if that's really what you
  want...."
   "Hey! Don't take it so hard, buddy," Matt laughed,
  clapping his hand on my shoulder. "You win some, you
   lose some. This time you lost. No hard feelings. Maybe
   you'll have better luck with the next one. We're both
   men of the world, and we know one broad's just like
  any other."
   "Matt, buddy" I said through clenched teeth, "get
  that hand off my shoulder before it loses a body."
  As I said, even on our short trip back from Limbo I
   had been so underwhelmed by Matt that I no longer
   even bothered trying to be polite or mask my dislike for
   him. He could grate on my nerves faster than anyone I
   had ever met. If he was a successful con artist, able to
   inspire trust from total strangers, then I was the Queen
  of May.
  "Matt's just kidding," Luanna soothed, stepping
  between us.
  "Well I'm not," I snarled. "Just remember you're
  welcome here any time you get fed up with this slug."
  "Oh, I imagine we'll be together for quite some
   time," Matt leered, patting Luanna lightly on her rump.
   "With you big shots vouching for us we should be able
   to beat this swindling rap... and even if we lose, so
   what? All it means is I'll have to give them back their
  crummy twenty gold pieces."
   Aahz's hammering stopped abruptly ... or maybe it
  was my heart.
  I tried vainly to convince myself that I hadn't heard
  him right.
  "Twenty gold pieces?" I said slowly.
  "Yeah. They caught on to us a lot quicker here at the
   Bazaar than I thought they would. It wasn't much of a
   

   

   

   

   172            Robert Asprin
  haul even by my standards. I can't get over the fact that
   you big shots went through so much trouble to drag us
   back here over a measly twenty gold pieces. There must
   be more to this principle thing than I realized."
  "Ummm... could I have a word with you, part-
   ner?" Aahz said, putting down his hammer.
  "I was about to ask the same thing," I admitted,
   stepping to the far side of the room.
  Once we were alone, we stared at each other, neither
   wanting to be the first to speak.
  "You never did get around to asking Hay-ner how
   much was at stake, did you?" Aahz sighed absently.
  "That's the money side of negotiations and I thought
   you covered it," I murmured. "Funny, we both stood
   right there the whole time and heard every word that
   was said, and neither of us caught that omission."
  "Funny. Right. I'm dying." My partner grimaced.
  "Not as much as you will if word of this gets out," I
   warned. "I vote that we give them the money to pay it
   off. I don't want to, but it's the only way I can think of
   to keep this thing from becoming public knowledge."
  "Done." Aahz nodded. "But let me handle it. If
   Matt the Rat there gets wind of the fact that the whole
   thing was a mistake on our part, he'd probably black-
   mail us for our eyeteeth."
  "Right, "I agreed.
  With that, we, the two most sought-after, most
   highly-paid magicians at the Bazaar, turned to deal with
   our charges, reminded once more why humility lies at
   the core of greatness.
