   "You switched it!" he accused with sudden realization. "This isn't the contract I handed you!"    "Nonsense," Phule said. "That's your signature on the last page, isn't it?"    Huey barely glanced at the indicated page.    "It may be ... More likely a forgery," he spat. "Either that or you pulled the last page and attached it to a new contract. Don't think you're going to get away with this!"    "That's an interesting accusation," the commander said, unruffled. "Though I suspect it would be hard to prove in court. Of course, if you did try to take this to court, we'd be forced to make our tapes a part of the public record to defend the position that you were fired with cause. That might make it a little hard for you to find another position, since I doubt the media would let the story die until they had broadcast the footage several dozen times."
