   "I hear what you're saying, Aahz. But we're only talking about one kid here. How much trouble can one little girl be?"    My partner's face suddenly split into one of his infamous evil grins. "Remember that quote," he said.  "I'm going to be tossing it back at you from time to time."    "But..."    "Hey, Boss! There's someone here to see you!"    Just what I needed! I had already pretty much resolved not to take on any more clients until after Markie's father had reclaimed her. Of course, I didn't want to say that in front of Aahz, especially considering our current conversation.
