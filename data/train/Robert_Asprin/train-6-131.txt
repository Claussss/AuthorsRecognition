"Now are you going to answer or are you so dumb you don't know what's on the other side of the door you're guarding?"    The guard flushed bright red, and I noticed his partner's knuckles whitening on the pike he was gripping. It occurred to me that now that I had landed the magician's job, it might not be the wisest course to continue antagonizing the military.
