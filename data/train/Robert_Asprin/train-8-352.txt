   "And who would that be?" Nunzio sez.    Snake's smile slips away and his voice drops a dozen degrees.    "Don Bruce wants to talk to you ... he wants to talk to you real bad." Chapter Fourteen:       "You countermanded me on whose authority?"       -POPE JOHN    "THAT'S QUITE SOME babe you got there."    I shoot a sideways glance at Snake when he sez this, but his manner seems as respectful as his tone, so I decide he is sincere and not tryin' to be sarcastic.
