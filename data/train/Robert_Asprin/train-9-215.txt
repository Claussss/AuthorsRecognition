   The "Mr. Skeeve" thing had been starting to get to me with the bellhop, but it hadn't seemed worth trying to correct.  If I was going to be spending the next few days traveling with Edvik, however, I thought I'd try to set him straight before he got on my nerves.    "All right. Skeeve it is," the cabbie agreed easily. "Just offhand, I'd say it would probably be easier to start with the financial folks."
