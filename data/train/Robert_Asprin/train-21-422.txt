"You lost me there," I said. "I thought marriages were supposed to be ..." "... Based on love?" Chumley finished for me. "That's what most young people think. That's also why so many of their marriages fall apart." Even though he had sort of warned me in advance, I found the troll's position to be a bit unsettling. "Urn, Chumley? Are we differentiating between 'analytical' and 'cynical'?" "It's not really as insensitive as it sounds, Skeeve," the troll said with a laugh, apparently unoffended by my comment. "You see, when you're young and full of hormones, and come in close contact for the first time with someone of the opposite sex who isn't related to you, you experience feelings and urges that you've never encountered before. Now since, despite their bragging to the contrary, most people are raised to think of themselves as good and decent folks, they automatically attach the socially correct label to these feelings: Love. Of course, there's also a socially correct response when two people feel that way about each other ... specifically, marriage."
