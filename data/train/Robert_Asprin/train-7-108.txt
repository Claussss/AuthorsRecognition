   An awfully nice chap, really. I decided I could afford to unbend a little.    "Crunch thanks nice man. If nice man needs strong friend, call Crunch, okay?"    "Sure thing. And if I can help you any more, just give a holler."    I left then before we got too chummy. I mean, there are precious few people who will be civil, much less nice, to a troll, and I was afraid of getting more interested in continuing my conversation with him than with finding Tananda. For the good of Arcadia, that would never do.
