   Not for the first time, it occurred to me that for some     one who claimed not to have enough magikal talent to be      a magician, Tanda occasionally displayed a lot more knowl     edge and skill than I had as the Royal Magician of Possiltum.    At the tent flap Aahz didn't even hesitate or knock, if knocking was possible on a big tent. He just stepped inside and Tanda led me right behind him.
