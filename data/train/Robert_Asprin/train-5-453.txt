   "Hello, Geek," I purred. "Have a seat. I want to have a little chat with you about a card game."    "C'mon, Skeeve. I already told you ..."    The Geek dropped into the indicated chair like gravity had suddenly trebled. I had borrowed the tone of voice from Nunzio's dragon-training demonstration. It worked.    "What the Geek was starting to say," I explained, turning to Aahz, "is that before the game tonight he warned me that I was overmatched and asked me not to have any hard feelings... that the game with the Kid wasn't his idea."
