Footsore, too miserable even to nose  through the promising bones and rinds  she lay  in,  Tyr cowered  and  whimpered in  restless  anguish for  hours.  Finally weariness forced her, still crying, into  a wretched sleep. Soon enough the  sun would be up. But it would rise black, as far as Tyr was concerned. Joy was  over forever. The tall thing was meat, and the Presence was gone. As  sleep took  her, Tyr  came her  closest ever  to having  a genuine  thought.
