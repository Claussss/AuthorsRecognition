Aahz drawled.    "You will see," the officer smiled. "Tomorrow."    With that, he spun on his heel and marched off, his officers trailing behind him.    "What do you think, Aahz?" I murmured.    "Think?" my mentor scowled. "I think you're going soft, kid. First Brockhurst, now Claude. What is this â€˜be kind to enemies' kick you're on?" "I meant about tomorrow," I clarified quickly. "I dunno, kid," Aahz admitted. "He sounded too confident for comfort. I wish I knew what he's got up his sleeve that's supposed to stop demons." "Well," I sighed, "I guess we'll see tomorrow."
