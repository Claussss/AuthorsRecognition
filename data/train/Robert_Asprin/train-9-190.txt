   I had had trouble dozing off anyway, what with the unaccustomed traffic noise and all. When I did finally manage to get to sleep, it seemed I had barely closed my eyes when there was a brisk knocking at the door of my room.    "Wazzit?" I called, struggling to get my eyes open far enough to navigate.    In response, the door opened and the bellhop who had brought my luggage up the day before came bustling into , the room.
