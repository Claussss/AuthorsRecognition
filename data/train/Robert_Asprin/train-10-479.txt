   By the time I got there the sound from the skulls in my head was so painful I didn't even stop. I just went right on through and out onto a thick carpet of beautiful grass.    Aahz, Tanda, and Glenda followed me, with Aahz shut     ting the secret panel behind us, instantly stopping the painful energy pounding at my head. I would have been relieved if I      hadn't been so stunned at what faced me.
