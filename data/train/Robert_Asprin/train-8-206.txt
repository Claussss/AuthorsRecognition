   "Are you still here?" the proprietor demands, materializin' beside our table again. "I don't want to have to tell you again! Now get out before I call the cops!"    "I don't think so," Nunzio sez, starin' at the ceilin'.    "WHAT??!!"    "... In fact, I was thinkin' we might want to make your place our home away from home ... If you know what I mean."    "Izzat so?! Think just 'cause you're in the Army you can do anything you want, do you? Well, let me tell you something, soldier-boy. I happen to be a tax paying member of this community in good standing with the authorities, and soldiers or not they don't take too kindly to demons in these parts. In fact, I can't think of one good reason why I shouldn't call the police right now and have them drag you all right out of here!"
