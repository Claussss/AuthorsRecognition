The docking process interrupted my thoughts. We departed the shuttlecraft without exchanging words with the pilot. As I have noted before, exchanges between members of different castes are rare except at certain rank-levels. A Technician was waiting to receive us as we disembarked. "I am Or-Sah," he introduced himself. "I have been assigned to answer your questions." "This is Rahm," Zur responded, "a Planetary Commander of the Warriors, here to inspect the progress on various pieces of equipment being prepared for the Ant campaign."
