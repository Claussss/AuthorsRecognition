I have a new assignment for him and that ragtag gang of his."    "Yes, sir," the aide snapped, and quickly retreated from the office.    Several things troubled the aide as he headed for the communications room to carry out the general's order.    First, he had been thinking of requesting a transfer to Jester's company himself, and had been merely waiting for the right time to submit the necessary paperwork. As it was, however, it occurred to him that this was not the proper time for such a move, either from the viewpoint of the general's mood or from the fact that it looked like he had something unpleasant in store for that unit and its commander.
