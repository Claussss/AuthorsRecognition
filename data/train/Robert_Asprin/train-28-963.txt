killed One-Thumb off in his story. A minor sequencing problem. Poul's story has Cappen Varra going  off on an adventure with Gordy's  Jamie the Red. Gordie's Jamie the Red story won't be in the first book! A major sequencing problem! Oh, well. I owe Gordy one for talking me into editing this monster. I look at the stories already in the  bin and decide that the first draft of  my story needs some drastic rewriting.
