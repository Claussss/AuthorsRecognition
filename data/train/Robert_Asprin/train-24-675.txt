"Raht, second call." "Second anthill. Borer units extended. Queen's chamber and one egg chamber breached. Fifty-four percent casualties so far." "Tur-Kam, second call!" There was no reply. "Rahm to fourth anthill flyer leader." "Here, Commander." "Status report on your strike force." There was a pause before the reply came. "Unknown, Commander. We have not been contacted by our leader since the Borer units landed and are currently unable to establish communication."
