   "Sergeant Escrima!"    The voice cracked like a whip, and Escrima turned toward the bleacher of Legionnaires.    The company commander, who had been sitting, suited and ready for his own bout, stood pointedly in a position of attention. With careful deliberation, he raised his weapon to Escrima and held it in a salute. In a slow wave behind him, the entire company of Legionnaires rose and joined their commander, saluting their sergeant in his defeat.
