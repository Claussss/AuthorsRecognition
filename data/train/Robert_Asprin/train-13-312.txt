The little recruit's round face had its usual mellow expression, which, in combination with a raised hand, almost always spelled trouble.    Phule mentally chastised himself-he should have remembered Mahatma's tendency to question everything a superior said to him.

"Yes, Mahatma, what is it?" he asked, as patiently as he could manage.
