   "What book?"    "The one you..."    I took my eyes off the foot traffic and glanced at him.  He was dusting his hands innocently. The book was nowhere in sight.    I was opening my mouth to call him on his little disappearing act when something piled into me and sent me careening into a wall hard enough to make me see stars.    "Where do you think you're goin', Runt?" This last came from the pudgy individual I had just collided with. He had stopped to confront me and stood with his fists clenched, leaning slightly forward as if being held back by invisible companions. Fat or not, he looked tough enough to walk through walls.
