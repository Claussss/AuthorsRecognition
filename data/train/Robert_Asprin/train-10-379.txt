    didn't really come out.    I wanted to die. Why hadn't they just killed me as I slept?      Or maybe they had tried, which was why I hurt so much.    I also wanted to be sick, but that wasn't possible since there      wasn't anything left in my stomach.  But my stomach still felt      like it wanted to twist inside out and come up through my throat.      And the world spinning didn't help that feeling at all.
