   About a hundred paces along the secret passageway branched into two. One went to the right and up slightly, while the other went seemingly straight as far as the light from our torch would show.    Tanda was behind me and I handed her the light, again      pulling out the map.    It had changed again, showing the passageway we were in      and the intersection.  The map now wanted us to go right.
