   There was only one thing bad about the carrot juice. When      you came down off of it, you came down hard. Right now, if we were going to get to Donner by the middle of the night, I      needed another fix or two of the golden liquor.    This place didn't just look like Audry's; it could have been Audry's. And when the guy with the white apron and dirty rag      came out of the back room, I wasn't surprised in the slightest.
