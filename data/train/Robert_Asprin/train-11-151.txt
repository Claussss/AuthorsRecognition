Chapter Eight:    "Once more into the breach..."    -ZARNA, THE HUMAN CANNONBALL    FORTUNATELY, there was a setting for Jahk on our D-Hopper though Aahz had to search a bit to find it.    I wanted to go armed to the teeth, but my mentor vetoed the plan. Under cross-examination I had had to admit that I hadn't seen anyone in that dimension wearing arms openly except the city guards, and that was that. My ability to disguise things was weak when it came to metal objects, and swords and knives would have made us awfully conspicuous walking down the street. As Aahz pointed out, the one time you don't want to wear weapons is when they're more likely to get you into trouble than out of it.
