"The view-input units on your skimmer are inoperational." I noticed Tzu was trying to get my attention. "What is it, Tzu?" "With your permission, Commander, I'd like to communicate some instructions to Zome." "Certainly." I had no hesitation in yielding on this point. Zur had given me his assurances the situation was in hand. Details could wait until their return. For the time being, it was more important to let the Scientists proceed with their work.
