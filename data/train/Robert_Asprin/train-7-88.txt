   For a moment I thought the Deveel was going to come across the desk at my throat.    "What I'm complaining about is that your so-called agent organized a union in my factory that's costing me a bundle!"    "There's no proof he was involved... ."    "So how come his name comes up every time...."    "... And even if he was, I'm not sure what concern it is of mine. I run a business, Mr. Bane, with employees, not slaves. What they do on their off hours is their affair, not mine."
