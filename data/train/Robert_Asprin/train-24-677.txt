"Mir-Zat, Commander. Assuming command at first anthill." "Acknowledged." First anthill! Zah-Rah was dead. The first...no possibly the second casualty among the strike team leaders. "Yes, Commander." "Status report!" "Fourth anthill, Commander. Ordered flyers to drop all Surface Thumpers in an effort to maximize disruption of defenses." "Evidence of original strike force?" "Negative, Commander. We will be in the Borer units shortly. Will report findings at that time."
