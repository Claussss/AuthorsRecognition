"Uh ... thanks, Grimble," I said, still unsure of exactly how to take his new attitude. "And who do we have here?" He turned his attention to Bunny, devouring her with his eyes like a toad edging up on a moth. I suddenly recalled that Aahz and I had first become embroiled in the workings of Possiltum after Grimble had picked Tananda up in a singles bar. It also occurred to me that I didn't like Grimble much.
