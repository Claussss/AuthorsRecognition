"Well ... to be honest with youse, Nunzio, I feel a little funny stirrin' up trouble at this particular location, seein' as how it was me what did the negotiatin' with Frumple to not cause him any grief."    Nunzio throws back his head and gives a bark of laughter ... which to me is a dubious way to express his sympathy at my plight.
