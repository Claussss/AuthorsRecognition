   Tanda pointed to one of the towns. "Following Skeeve's plan of going to towns that start with the letter B, we head for Biscuit."    "Sounds good to me," I said.    Aahz just shook his head in amazement.    "As good as any, I suppose."    He studied the map for a moment more and then folded it up and put it away.    Biscuit was on the road that stayed north going out the west      side of Bank. I doubted it would be hard to find. I took anÂ­other sip while Tanda wrinkled her nose at my drink and me.
