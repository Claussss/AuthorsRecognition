"Relax, Mr. Hendricks," Tambu assured him. "Everything is under control." "For an arms dealer, you seem awfully nervous around guns," Whitey observed. "Just because I sell weapons doesn't mean I like to be around when they're used," Hendricks snapped defensively. "If I had my way, I'd deal only through the mail." "Quite understandable," Tambu nodded. "Now then, Mr. Hendricks, if you could begin going over the weapons specs with Whitey here, I'd like to have a word with Egor."
