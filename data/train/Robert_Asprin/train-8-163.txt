   There is a moment's silence, then someone in the ranks lets out a low, surprised whistle, which seems to cue everyone to put in their two cents worth.    "Nice goin', Swatter!!"    " 'Bout time someone taught him to..."    Hy Flie starts nudgin' the corporal's nappin' form with his toe.    "They don't look so big lying down, do they, Swatter?" he grins, like he took the two of 'em out all by himself.
