          Metal was hard to work with because it was an inert material. The           feather, having once been part of a living thing, was more           responsiveâ€¦ too responsive. To lift metal took effort, to           maneuver a feather required subtlety.           Of the two, I preferred to work with metal. I could see a more direct           application of that skill in my chosen profession.
