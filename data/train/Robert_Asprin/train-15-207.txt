   "Show me," said the captain, and again she had to bite her lip to keep from breaking out into a grin.    "Yes, but please stay close to me," she said, allowing him to help her to her feet. "I don't want him finding me alone."    "Don't worry," said the captain. "You'll be all right. He's probably run away by now, but we'll catch him if he hasn't." He began walking quietly-almost supernaturally quietly, and very confidently-down the corridor. It occurred to Lola that he was most likely highly trained at one or more martial arts. It was a good thing their plan didn't require them to engage the captain in unarmed combat. She allowed herself to shudder at the notion-it would add a touch of verisimilitude to her "maiden in distress" act.
