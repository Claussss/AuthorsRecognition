   I didn't care. I had done it, and done it right the first time.      For the moment that was all that mattered.    "So what's next?"    "We do the same spell with energy lines," Aahz said, "im     printing them on this map of the castle."    I knew that was what he was going to want, but doing that      meant stepping out of my mind to look down on the energy lines through the entire area. And the last time I had tried that I almost hadn't made it back inside my own mind. Of course, Aahz didn't know I had even tried. I didn't want to tell him because I knew he'd be angry.
