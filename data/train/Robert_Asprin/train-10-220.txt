   I kept pretending, wishing the stuff tasted good, since the idea of eating had made me hungry.    After a moment the guy in charge nodded to Glenda, smiling as if she had promised him more than I wanted to think about.    She motioned that I should join her and I did, carrying our plates. The guy led us through the door and into what might be called a kitchen. There were barrels of the different veggies against one wall, and some dirty plates and glasses stacked near a water barrel. No wonder everything tasted so bad. I didn't want to even think about the fact that I had eaten a bite of some of the stuff from this room.
