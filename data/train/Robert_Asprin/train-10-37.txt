   "Counting backwards," I said, pointing at my index finger,      "the dimension before that was where we had to look like a form of a three-nosed pig."    I wiggled my index finger at both of them. Tanda nodded.  "Yeah, fun place."    "Not really," I said. Aahz's glare got deeper, so I went on. "Before that was the dimension where we had to be eight feet tall and have three legs." I pointed at my middle finger. Tanda laughed. "That was a fun dimension, too. Wasn't it?" It hadn't been, since walking on three legs is something that is a factor harder than trying to fly by flapping your arms and jumping off a cliff.  But I ignored her this time and went on.
