"When are you going to do something about Egor?" she asked absently. "Egor's one of OUT oldest captains. His seniority gives him certain considerations." "He's a braggart and a bully. Everyone in the fleet knows that." "He has an irritating manner," Tambu admitted, "but he's a good man. You've just got to know him before you can see through his bluster." "If so, you must be the only one who can do it. The other captains are wondering why you don't boot him out, or at least pull his command."
