   Big Julie is sprawled on a recliner, soakin' up the morning sun as he picks at the food laid out on the table next to him.    "Shhh! Could you keep it down?" Nunzio hisses, puttin' a finger to his lips as he hurries over to our host.    "What for?" Big Julie sez, still speakin' in that loud, projectin' voice of his.    "Well ... ummm ..." I sez, shootin' a glance at Nunzio who just shrugs. "To tell you the truth, Big Julie, we are takin' it on ourselves to bring yesterday's argument to a close by goin' after the queen before there is any further discussion. This effort will, of course, go to waste if the others hear you and emerge before we have made our departure."
