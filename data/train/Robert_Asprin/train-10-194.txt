   We strolled along the wooden sidewalk, trying to look as      if we belonged. Of course, in a town that couldn't have more than a few hundred full-time residents, four newcomÂ­ers stood out like a bad blister in new shoes.    "Howdy," the first man we passed said to us. He tipped his hat and just kept right on moving.    By the time I tipped my hat back, he was past us.    A woman in long skirts and a flower-patterned blouse walked past us a few moments later.
