   "I'm sure the sergeant's account is complete and accurate ... sir," I sez, crisp-like.    Normally, I would have just clammed up until I had a lawyer, but so far no charges have been mentioned, and I somehow don't think this is a good time to make waves.    "Very well," the officer nods. "In that case I feel compelled to follow the sergeant's recommendation in this case."    It occurs to me that maybe I should have offered up some defense, but it is too late now, as the officer has already swung into action. Pickin' up a quill, he scribbles his name across the bottom of a series of papers that have been sittin' on his desk.
