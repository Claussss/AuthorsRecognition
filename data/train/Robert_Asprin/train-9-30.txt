   My response was reflexive.    "That's Per-vect. And I'm not. I mean, I'm not one."    The Djin cocked his head and squinted at me.  "Really? You sure look like one. Besides, I've never met anyone who wasn't a Perver... excuse me, Pervect... who would argue the difference."    It was sort of a compliment. Anyway, I took it as one.  It's always nice to know when your spells are working.  "It's a disguise," I said. "I figured it was the only way to operate on Perv without getting hassled by the natives."
