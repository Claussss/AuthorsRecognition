            "Nonsense," responded the first with equal sarcasm. "His two oldest friends? Brockhurst and Higgens? How could he possibly not remember our names? Just because he forgot to share the loot doesn't mean he'd forget our names. Be fair, Higgens."             "Frankly, Brockhurst," responded the other. "I'd rather he remembered the loot and forgot our names."             Their words were stuffy and casual, but the cross-bows never wavered.
