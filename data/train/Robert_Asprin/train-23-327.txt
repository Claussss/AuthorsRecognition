Ramona shook her head. "You know, lover, for a grim, humorless type, at times you have an incredible talent for understatement." "Meaning what?" "Meaning this is the first time you've come up for air in over two days. When your mind drifts, you don't kid around!" "Two days!" Tambu exclaimed, ignoring her jibe. "What happened? Was I drinking? What about the fleet?" "Whoa!" Ramona interrupted, holding up her hand. "The fleet's fine-or as good as could be expected. You haven't been drinking, you've been working. Nonstop. What's more, you worked thirty hours straight before you stopped talking to me or acknowledging there was anything in the universe except you and that damned viewscreen."
