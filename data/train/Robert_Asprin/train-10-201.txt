   Every person in the place glanced up at us as we entered,      then went back to eating and talking as if they saw strangers      every day and just didn't care. I considered that a good sign.    "Howdy, folks," the guy behind the bar said, wiping a spot      off the wood surface in front of him. "What's your pleasure?"    I had no idea what the guy meant. I sort of understood the words, but standing in the middle of a bar, I sure didn't understand why he was asking me about pleasure. Just a little too personal a question for someone I didn't know.
