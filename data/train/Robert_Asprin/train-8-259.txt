   I still didn't like the way that bruise was healin', and it must have shown in my voice 'cause Tananda leans forward and puts a hand on my arm.    "I'm all right, Guido, really ... though it's sweet of you to be worried. I've gotten a lot worse just rough-housing with Chumley ... honest."    Realizin' that her big brother is a troll, I can well believe that Tananda is used to gettin' dinged up a bit in family squabbles. Right now, however, there is somethin' else weighin' on my mind.
