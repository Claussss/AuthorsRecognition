   howl, they swarmed down the street in pursuit.   When I say "with a howl," I'm not speaking figura-    tively. As they ran, some of the vampires transformed    into large, fierce-looking dogs, others into bats, pre-    sumably to gain more speed in the chase. While Aahz    and I had been chased by mobs before, this was the first    pack of pursuers who literally bayed at our heels. I must    say I didn't care much for the experience.
