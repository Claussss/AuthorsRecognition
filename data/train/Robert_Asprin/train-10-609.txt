"I've done a number of them over the years to build shields and walls."    "So back to my problem," I said. "How do we get down there without being run over by the mounted posse?"    Aahz pointed to a spot on the map. At first I couldn't see what he was pointing at, then I saw it. The very same tunnel I had been afraid I was going to end up down in.
