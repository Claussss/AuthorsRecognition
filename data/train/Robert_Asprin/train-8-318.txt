"You're in constant danger of choking to death on a doughnut!"    "Doughnut, is it?" the cop sez, lookin' around slow at the other cops ... maybe to count heads and check the odds before decidin' what to do or say next.    I turned my head to sneak a wink at Nunzio, just in time to see Tananda make her entrance from the stairs.
