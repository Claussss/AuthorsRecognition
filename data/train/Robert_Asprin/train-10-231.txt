   I dumped the awful food and dipped the plates, doing my      best to keep calm. But pretty soon I was out of dishes to wash. I used the dirty rag to wipe off all the plates and stack them, then I wiped off the counter as well. After I was done I couldn't think of anything else to do, so I went back out to the bar.    "My friend came in a few minutes ago," I said.      He looked as if he might cry, so I went quickly on with my lie.
