He nodded toward the wall facing the street, where wicker lattices screened the large openings to either side of the door. The sides of the room were ventilated by high, horizontal slits that opened onto alleys even more fetid than the interior of the tavern. Samlor meant exactly what he said, though it would cause trouble that he'd really rather avoid.
