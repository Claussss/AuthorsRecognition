   "The Ax is the greatest Character Assassin in all the dimensions," Aahz said with a snarl. "He works freelance and charges fees that make ours look like pocket change. Once the Ax is on your tail, though, you might as well kiss it goodbye. He's ruined more careers than five stock-market crashes. Haven't you ever heard the expression â€˜take the ax to someone'? Well, that's where it comes from."    I felt that all-too-familiar "down elevator" sensation in my stomach.
