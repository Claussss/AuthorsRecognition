   I plopped down in the chair being held for me, but waved off the offered menu.    "I understand you serve dishes from off-dimension?"    The Pervect gave a little half-bow.    " Yas. Ve haff a wide selection for the most discriminating taste."    I nodded knowingly.    "Then just have the waiter bring me something Klahdish... and a decent wine to go with it."    "Very good. Sir."    He faded discreetly from view, leaving me to study our fellow diners. It was too much to hope that coincidence would lead Aahz to the same dining room, but it didn't hurt to look.
