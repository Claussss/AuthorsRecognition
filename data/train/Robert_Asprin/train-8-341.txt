   I would like nothin' more than a little time to think over this latest development, but it is not to be. Nunzio barely waits until we are clear of the commander's office before he starts on me.    "Guido," he sez, "am I crazy, or is the army?"    "Probably both," I sez, "though I'll admit I think the army has an edge on you in the 'foo-foo land' department."    "I don't get it. I just don't get it," he continues like I hadn't said anythin'. "I mean, we disobeyed standing orders ... even roughed up the cops for cryin' out loud. And we get promoted for that"!"
