"Yeah, scuttlebutt has it that any outfit caught gougin' extra profits out of army contracts is gonna get shut down and their entire inventory confiscated by the government."    "Is that legal?"    "Hey, we're talkin' the queen here. If she sez it's legal, it's legal."    "When is this gonna happen?"    "Not until next month, the way I hear it," I sez. "I just thought you might like to know a little in advance. You know, so just in case any of youse guys' prices should need some quick readjusting youse could do it before the audit started."
