I telepathed my order to the formation. "Power on one...Ready...Three...Two...One!" As I sent the final signal, I trod down solidly on the footplate and felt the surge of power as the engine cut in. There was no roar, not even a whisper of sound. This was one of the advantageous features of this new propulsion system.

As a Warrior race, we had other uses for it.
