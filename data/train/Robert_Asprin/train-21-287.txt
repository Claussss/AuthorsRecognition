"What did you talk to him about?" My bodyguard hesitated, then glanced away quickly. "Oh ... this and that," he said with an exaggerated shrug. "I really can't remember for sure." "Nunzio," I said, letting a note of sternness creep into my voice, "if you can remember, tell me. It's important." "Well ... I was goin' on a bit about how worried I was about you, Boss," Nunzio admitted hesitantly. "You remember how you was right after we decided to incorporate? How you was gettin' so wrapped up in work that you didn't have much time for anything or anyone else? I just unloaded on Gleep a bit about how I didn't think it was healthy for you, is all. I didn't think it would hurt nothin'. That's why I did my talkin' in front of him and not anyone else on the team ... even Guido."
