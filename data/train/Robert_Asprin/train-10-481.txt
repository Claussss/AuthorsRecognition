    standing on, the room looked like a large suite, with a big bed,      a kitchen against one wall, and a private bathroom area off to      one side.    The guy was sitting in what looked like a livingroom area,      except that there was only one chair.  He looked over at us, then shook his head as if not believing what he was seeing. Then he looked at us again and jumped to his feet, an expression of sheer joy and happiness on his face.
