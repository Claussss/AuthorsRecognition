   Terrific!!    I had rapidly discovered that I wasn't wild about the idea of my escapade being discussed by the general populace.  Especially not since it ended with a session with the police.  Even though he had noted my displeasure at discussing the prior night's incident, Edvick seemed determined not to let the subject die as we started on our way.  "I told you you should have gotten a bodyguard," he lectured. "Carrying that kind of cash around is just askin' for trouble."
