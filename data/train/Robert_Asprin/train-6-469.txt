   "Tell you what," I interrupted. "I'll ask the questions, and you decide which ones are okay to answer. Fair enough?"    "So it would seem," he admitted.    "Okay," I began. "First question. Do you think the commander will actually bypass Possiltum?"    The officer avoided my eyes for a moment, then shook his head briskly.    "I should not answer that," he said, "but I will. I do not feel the commander is even considering it as a serious possibility, nor does any officer in that tent. He is known as â€˜the Brute,' even among his most loyal and seasoned troops. May I assure you he did not acquire that nickname by surrendering or capitulating while his force was still intact."
