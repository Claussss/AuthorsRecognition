   "... Or do you think you're better at locatin' folks than the police are?"    I was getting desperate. It seemed that no matter what I said, it was getting twisted into the worst possible interpretation.    "He's not really missing. Look, officer, I had a falling out with my old partner, who happens to also be the co-founder of the corporation and a Pervect. He left in a huff, presumably to return here to Perv. All I want to do is locate him and try to convince him to come back to the company, or at least make amends so we can part on more agreeable terms. In short, while it's business related, it's more of a personal matter."
