   "I don't like it," Tananda growled. "It's too convenient. Somehow this game has the Ax's fingerprints all over it."    "You're probably right," Aahz sighed. "But there's not much else we can do except accept the challenge and try to make the best of a bad situation."    "Bite the bullet and play the cards we're dealt. Eh, Aahz?" I murmured.    I though I had spoken quietly, but everyone around the table winced, including Markie. They might be loyal enough to risk their lives and careers defending me, but they weren't going to laugh at my jokes.
