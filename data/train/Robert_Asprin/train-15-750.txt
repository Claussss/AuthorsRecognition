"At long last the Hidden Ones speak to us!"    "Triff," said Brick. "But what the hell are they talking about?"

Now that we've got the communication channel open, we can try to start them talking to us instead of to the Port-a-Brain." He turned to Qual. "Leftenant, you're the officer in charge. What do we want to say to them?"
