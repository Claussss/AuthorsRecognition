   I was just overtaking them when Aahz stopped suddenly in his tracks and started to turn. Unable to halt my headlong sprint, I plowed into him, knocking him sprawling.    "In a hurry, handsome?" Tanda asked, eyeing me slyly.    "Gee, Aahz," I stammered, bending over him, "I didn't mean to-"    From a half sitting position, his hand lashed out in a cuff that spun me halfway around.    "Watch where you're going next time," he growled.
