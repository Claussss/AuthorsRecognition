"Mr. Tidwell, your answer is eloquent, if unwise. You are aware that such a contest would be fought to the death?" Tidwell nodded. He hadn't been, but he was now. Inwardly, he gritted his teeth. Kumo wasn't leaving him any outs. "Very well. The time will be now, the place here. For weapons, you may have your choice." Clever bastard! He's waiting to see weapons choice before he picks my opponent. "I'll fight as I stand."
