   "Hey! Nothing personal. It's just that people talk, ya know?"    "No, I don't... but I'm learning."    It seemed that however large and populated Perv appeared to be, there was a thriving network of gossip lurking just out of sight.    I had come down early, hoping to have a chance to talk with J.R., but between my room and the front door I had been stopped by two bellhops and the desk clerk, all of whom knew that I had been in a fight the night before. Of course, they each expressed their sympathies... in varying degrees. As I recall, the desk clerk's sympathy went some thing like "You're, welcome to use the hotel safe for your valuables, sir... but we can't accept responsibility for any losses."
