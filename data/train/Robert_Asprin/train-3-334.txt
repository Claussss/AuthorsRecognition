She  sat up  languidly, threw  back the  thin coverlet,  rose, and  pulled on  a sleeveless robe of pale blue silk. On a small, ornately carved table beside  her bed lay a  bronze comb. She  picked it up,  began idly to  tease it through  the thick mass of  her blond curls  as she crossed  the room and  sat on the  window sill. The sun felt wonderfully warm on her flesh. It would be a scorching day.
