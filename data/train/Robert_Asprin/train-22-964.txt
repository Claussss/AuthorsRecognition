experience: however terrible  the battle: however  frightful the odds,  we had a chance. We could fight back and survive  - or at least take our foe-men  with us as we fell. Being trussed up like a sacrificial animal, helpless to do  anything but watch your enemy - no, not  your enemy - your tormentor's weapon descend  on you again and again ... No being, slave or freedman, should be forced into that.
