Pete ignored it and sank into one of the numerous chairs dotting the office. "Okay, boss, what went wrong?" "With the meeting?" "Yes, with the meeting. What happened?" "You sound mad." Pete blew a deep breath out, relaxing a little. "A bit. More puzzled. I'm trying to be level-headed about all this but I get the feeling I'm not playing with all the cards."
