    like a soldier going after a dangerous outlaw.    I got to the door, braced myself, and eased open the door la     tch then shoved hard, the rock from Kowtow ready in my hand as I stumbled in.    My momentum pushed me three steps into the room be     fore I caught my balance and stopped. I had the rock raised to      hit at Glenda, who I expected to be standing there, ready to fight me.    She wasn't there.
