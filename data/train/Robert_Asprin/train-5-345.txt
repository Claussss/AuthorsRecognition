   Nunzio's hand snaked out and closed over Gleep's snout. With a jerk he pulled the nose down until it was under my pet's head, then pushed up sharply.    In mid-stride the dragon's haunches dropped into a sitting position and he stopped, all the while batting his eyelashes in bewilderment.    "Now stay. Stay!!"    My bodyguard carefully opened his hand and stepped back, holding his palm flat in front of my pet's face.
