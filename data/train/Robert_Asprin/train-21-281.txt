"Hi, BUTTERCUP, How's it going, fellah?" The war unicorn raised his head and stared at me for a moment, then went back to eating from his feed bin. "Com'on, fellah. You know me," I urged. The unicorn continued eating, ignoring me completely. "Don't worry, Boss" came a squeaky voice from behind me. "Unicorns are like that." I didn't have to look to see who the voice belonged to, but turned to face my bodyguard anyway.
