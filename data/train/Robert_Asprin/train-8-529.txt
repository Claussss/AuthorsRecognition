I sez, the words finally sinkin' in.    "Don't worry," Pookie sez, givin' me a small smile and a wink. "We aren't at all alike."    "Can you guys keep it down?" Tananda hisses at us. "I'm trying to eavesdrop on this!"    Wrenchin' my attention away from Pookie, I finally start to focus in on what's goin' on.
