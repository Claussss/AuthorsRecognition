   Again it had changed.    I kept sipping my carrot juice as I studied the parchment.      Bank, the town we were in, was the main town on the map now. And the treasure was now located in a city called Placer. Three roads left Bank and headed off in three directions, all, in one fashion or another, getting to Placer after a few more towns.    "Now which way?" I asked, staring at our options.    They were towns called Chip, Pie, and Biscuit. Weird names. Everything about this dimension was starting to seem weird to me.
