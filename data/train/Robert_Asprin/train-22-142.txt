They left the horses to go to  a big boulder outside the trees but  distant from the road. At its base  was a hollow large enough  for them to lie down  in. Here they slept, waking now and then to talk softly or to eat a bite or to go  behind the'rock and urinate. The insects weren't so numerous here as in the trees,  but they were bad enough.- Not once, as far as they knew, did anyone pass on the road.
