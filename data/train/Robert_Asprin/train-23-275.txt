CHAPTER SIX Tambu bent forward over his console and pressed his palms over his ears, unsuccessfully attempting to block out the babble of voices gushing from the viewscreen's speaker. Failing that, he drew a breath to speak angrily, then reconsidered.

They were all too aware of the potential danger of this many ships united under a common cause.
