   After nearly half a year of wrestling with these difficulties, a      friend of mine made a suggestion. Specifically, why not write      another, simpler story first... something from Skeeve's earlier      days with Aahz. That would enable me to relearn the MYTH      writing style, after which I could tackle the more convoluted      story of Something M.Y.T.H. Inc.    The result is the volume you are currently holding. SequenÂ­tially, it occurs between volumes three-Myth-Direction-and four-Hit or Myth. (They will be republished in the combined omnibus Myth Adventures Two in February 2002 from Meisha Merlin Publishing, Inc.) If the plan holds, Something M.Y.T.H. Inc. will follow it VERY shortly.
