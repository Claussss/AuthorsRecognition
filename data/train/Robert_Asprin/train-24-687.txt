"Mir-Zat, Commander. All targets in the first anthill have been destroyed. We are commencing our withdrawal. Sixty-eight percent casualties so far." "Acknowledged." "Flyer Leader from third anthill to Commander. Request permission to land flyers and assist in strike team's withdrawal." That gave me pause. Apparently the flyers from Kah-Tu's force were refusing her order to rendezvous with the transports, asking instead to try to rescue the stranded ground force.
