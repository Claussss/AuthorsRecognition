   What do I do now?    I had no idea.    Nothing. I was stuck here for the moment. Maybe forever      if something happened to Aahz and Tanda, or if they couldn't      find me.    The thought made me panic, so I kept washing dishes.    After a few minutes the guy came back in with more dirty      plates. He was clearly disappointed that Glenda was not back yet, but he said nothing. He put the plates down and then left.
