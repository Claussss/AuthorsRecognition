"To be absolutely veracious, other than by their signals, we have had no success whatever in detecting these drones. It is as if they are invisible."    "Invisible!" said Beeker, leaning forward. "That would seem to defy the laws of physics, would it not, sir?"    "It would seem so," said Phule. "Possibly it has something to do with your equipment, though. Our two races use different frequencies, and not all the Alliance races use the same frequencies for their internal communications, either. Once our base is properly set up, we'll see whether these signals register on our own equipment. Have you been able to trace where the drones come from?"
