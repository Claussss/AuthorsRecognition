            "Hey, kid. I pointed them out to you, remember?"             "But why are they following us? What do they want?"                          "Well, I don't know for sure, of course, but I'd guess it has something to do with our disguises."             I snuck another glance at the crowd. The interest in us did not seem to be lessening at all. If anything, the crowd was even bigger and looked even angrier. Terrific.
