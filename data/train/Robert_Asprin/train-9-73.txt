   "Look out!" I shouted, pointing frantically at the obstructions.    Without losing eye contact, the driver's hand lashed out and smashed down on the toy stuffed goose that was taped down in front of him. The thing let out a harsh, tremendous "HONK!!" that would have gotten it named king of the geese if they ever held an election.    "Anyway, that's what I'm talkin' about." The driver finished and turned his attention forward again.  The traffic jam had miraculously melted away before he had finished speaking, and we sailed through the intersection unscathed.
