Crit asked, to hear the voice again, "What do you want, honest work? There isn't any, not here. Prefer my service to Jubal's? Is that what you're getting at?" "Yours? You've got a service, now? That's how come the black man sent me to help you out?" The hooded man's ^'s were sibilantly northern and the tension underly- ing his words was full of satisfaction. Somebody they'd done something to once, for sure. Somebody the Sacred Band hadn't treated with softest gloves. Somebody who was en- joying this more than he ought, because he feared Crit and his kind more than he'd admit.
