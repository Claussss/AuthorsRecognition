   The possibility of a fast resolution of the problem seemed to brighten Skeeve's mood immensely. I was almost tempted to go along with it, but I had the feeling there was more to the situation than was meeting the eye.    "I dunno, Skeeve. I think I'd like to hear a little more about exactly what the problem is, if it's all right with you."    "C'mon, Aahz. Let's just settle his accounts and split. If we hurry, we can be back at the office by lunch."
