And... suppose H.R.H. Kadakithis, P-G, did  nothing? Or if his Hell Hounds,  the charming Razkuli and  Zaibar, received their  orders but only  pretended to act? Did not Rankans protect  their own? Did not  soldiers obey authority? Was  there not honour among those thieving over-Lords? If not, then Hanse's world would  be a-teeter. Despite his pretences  there  had to be   trust and   some sort   of order,   didn't there,   and trustworthiness?
