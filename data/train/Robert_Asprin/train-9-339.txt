   He paused and shook his head.    "I can't go along with that. I realized then that if I stayed, I'd fall into the same trap all your other colleagues have...  of inadvertently doing your thinking for you when we express our own opinions. The sad thing is that we aren't, really. You decide yourself what advice you do and don't listen to. The trouble is, you only remember when you go against advice and it goes wrong... like when you got drunk tonight. Any correct judgment calls you assume were made by your â€˜advisors.' Well, you've convinced me that you're a right guy, Skeeve. Now all you have to do is convince yourself. That's why I'm going to head on back to Djinger and let you work this problem out on your own.  Right or wrong, there'll be no one to take the credit or share the blame. It's all yours. I'm betting your solution will be right."
