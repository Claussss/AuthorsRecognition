   At that moment I knew, without a shadow of a doubt, that      I was as dead as any of the bodies in the room with us. I just      wasn't smart enough yet to lie down and stop breathing like      they had all done.

Let's get moving before someone comes in and      stops our fun treasure hunt before it really gets started."
