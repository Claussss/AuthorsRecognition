   "Swell," I sez, with more enthusiasm than I am feelin'. "Then we're all set. Youse go ahead and leave first. I'll stay up here awhile and give youse a head start."    As soon as she is gone, I settle myself to try to sort out my misgivin's about how things are goin' on this assignment. It doesn't take long to figure out that I am sufferin' under a burden of conflictin' loyalties.    Youse may find this surprisin' from someone in my line of work, but loyalty and betrayin' trust counts very high up in my books ... which is one of the things I have always admired about the M.Y.T.H. Inc. crew as they all seem to value the same thing.
