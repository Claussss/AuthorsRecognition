Smhee said, 'There's  an old adobe  building a quarter-mile  inland. We'll sleep there for a while. I don't know about you, but I'm weary.' She was glad to rest. After hobbling  the horses near a stand of the  tall brown desert grass, they lay down  in the midst of the  ruins. Smhee went to sleep  at once. She  worried about  her family  for a  while, and  suddenly she  was being shaken by Smhee. Dawn was coming up.
