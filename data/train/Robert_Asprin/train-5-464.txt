   I looked at the troll.    "Business is off for you, isn't it, Chumley?"    "Well, I don't like to complain ..."    "I know, but maybe you should once in a while, I had never stopped to think about it before, but you've been getting fewer and fewer assignments since you moved in with us, haven't you?"    "Is that true, Chumley?" Aahz said. "I never noticed ..."    "No one's noticed because the attention has always been on us, Aahz. The Aahz and Skeeve team has been taking priority over everything and everyone else. We've been so busy living up to our big-name image that we've missed what it's doing to our colleagues, the ones who have to a large extent been responsible for our success."
