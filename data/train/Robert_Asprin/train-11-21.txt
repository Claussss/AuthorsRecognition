   As I said, I am the court magician of Possiltum. I'm not without powers.    "Don't let it get you down, kid," Aahz called from the window. "If you keep practicing, someday we can take that tour under your protection. But until you reach that level, or until we find you a magikal bodyguard, it'll just have to wait."    "I suppose you're right, Aahz," I conceded. "It's just that sometimes..."    There was a soft BAMF! as the ether was rent asunder and a demon appeared in the room. Right there! In my private quarters in the Possiltum royal palace!
