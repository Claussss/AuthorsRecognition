"If you don't mind the observation," he said, "that little scene back there seems to have gotten you a little upset." "Shouldn't it have?" I snapped. "Don't let it bother you," my partner said easily. "Locals always get upset with outsiders ... especially when their women start flirting with them. It's a problem as old as the hills. Just ask any soldier or carny person. Don't take it personally."
