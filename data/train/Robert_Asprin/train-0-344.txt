   "What the hell's that supposed to mean?" said Do-Wop, as the others at the table laughed.    "I don't know for sure," said Super-Gnat, "but I think it means she expects you to piss and moan no matter what's going on."    "Well, sure," said Do-Wop, puzzled. "What else is a guy supposed to do to pass away the time?"    The others at the table laughed again.    "So you're going away," said Laverna. She and Beeker sat in a softly lit back booth in the Tumbling Dice Casino's Domino Bar. The other tables near them were empty; this time of afternoon, most of the casino's customers were at the gambling tables. Anybody who wanted a drink could have it delivered to the floor. That made this a perfect spot for a quiet talk.
