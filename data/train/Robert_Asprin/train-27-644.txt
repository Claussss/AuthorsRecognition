girl. Perhaps you  can tell me  who Molin Torchholder  suspects of using  beynit venom when the Harka Bey denies all knowledge of it?' 'He suspects a man, a Beysib man. He suspects that the death of my sister is not so different from the Beysib deaths.' 'Has he given you a name?' 'Yes, Turghurt Burek.' 'The son of the prime minister?' 'Yes, but the Torch suspects him anyway. He comes here, doesn't he?'
