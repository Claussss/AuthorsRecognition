"Do you have something to add to the discussion, Zur?" I asked. "One moment, Commander. I seem to recall...yes, here it is." He studied the data tape before continuing. "I regret to say horizontal tunneling will not be possible in this situation." "Explain?" requested Heem. "Although it is true the Ants employ cold-beams to bore their tunnels, it is merely to supplement their own abilities. Constructing a tunnel requires more than boring a horizontal hole. It also involves some type of bracing to prevent its collapse. The Ants accomplish this with a form of cement they make with their own saliva. We have no such ability, and to attempt to construct a tunnel without support could only be disastrous."
