   "Game?" Quigley/Skeeve said coolly, folding his arms. "That wasn't a game, that was a fight... even though I can see how you could easily confuse the two."    "You have no right to ... Put them down!"    This last was accompanied by a gesture at the suspended players. Skeeve didn't gesture, but the two players suddenly dropped to the turf with bone-jarring thuds that drew the same "Ooooo's" from the crowd as you get from a really good hit during actual play.
