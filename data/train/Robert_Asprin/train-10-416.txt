   Aahz nodded.  "Vampire cows."    "What?"  Glenda asked.    "We saw a field of cows change into beautiful naked people last night," I said, "and snack on the townspeople who were waiting to be used."    She looked at me, then at Aahz. "The kid's not kidding,      is he?"    Aahz shook his head.    Glenda shook her head and then closed her eyes.    "Drunk dry by bovine vampires.  How ironic."    She didn't say anything else, and Aahz didn't push her. She looked as if she had lost twenty pounds in one night. She had managed to outsmart us, find her way to the castle, and still get captured. If she couldn't get away, how were we going to do it before we became a full-moon snack?
