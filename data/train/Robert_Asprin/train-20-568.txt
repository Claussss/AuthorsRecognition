There was a  scream and a  crash from the  inside. Dubro dropped  his hammer and bumped into Walegrin at the doorway.  A third Stepson yanked the rope  loose and attempted, unsuccessfully, to  bully his way  past both Dubro  and Walegrin. The smith's hands closed on the Stepson's shoulder. The other pair reached for their weapons, but Thrusher already had his drawn. Everyone froze in place. Illyra appeared in the  doorway. "Just let them  go, Dubro," she asked  wearily.
