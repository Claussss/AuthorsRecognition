'Greetings, Riddler,' said the rider in  burgundy and scarlet, as he doffed  his helmet with its blood-dark crest to Tempus. 'I did not expect you, Abarsis. What could be  so urgent?' 'I heard  about the  Tros horse's  death, so I thought to bring you  another, better  auspiced, I  hope. Since  I was  coming anyway,  our friends suggested I  bring what you  require. I have  long wanted to  meet you.'
