   The idea of coming into a huge bedroom suite to find two      cows standing on a rumpled bed was too much for me. ToÂ­night was that night, the most dangerous night of the full moon according to Harold. I could hardly wait.

Aahz wanted to have Harold show us the books about the spells put over this castle, the spells put on everyone by Count Bovine, and what Harold knew of the magik energy surrounding this castle.
