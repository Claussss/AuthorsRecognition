   "Hello, C.H.," he said. "It's good to see you again."    "Hey, Cap'n," came the weak response. "How's it goin'?"    The sergeant shifted his huge form, and Phule realized with a start that he was trying to rise.    "Just stay where you are," he said, moving quickly to Harry's side. "Well, I hear you've been busy tonight."    "You heard that, huh?" C.H. grinned, sinking back into his pillows. "Busier'n I expected, that's for sure. Man, that dude was fast! If I hadn't gotten his kneecap with my first shot, he would have cleaned my clock. Even as it was, he got me a good lick before I put him to sleep."
