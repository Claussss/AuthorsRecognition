   I found myself staring at Chumly. He was craning his neck to look at the stands.    "What are you doing?" I asked, irritated by his apparent lack of concern with our situation.    "Hmmm? Oh. Sorry, old boy," the troll apologized. "I was just curious as to how many Deveels were in the crowd. There's a lot of them."    "There are?" I blinked, scanning the crowd. "I don't see any."    "Oh, they're disguised, of course," Chumly shrugged. "But you can see their auras if you check. With the odds that were being given on this bloody game, it was a sure thing they'd be here."
