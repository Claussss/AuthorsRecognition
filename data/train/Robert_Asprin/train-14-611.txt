CHAPTER FOURTEEN    Journal #129    I was fortunate enough to witness the events which made up the Legion vs. Army competition firsthand... though as a spectator, not as a judge. Though I normally try to stay emotionally detached from the antics of the company beyond what has immediate effect on my employer, I will admit to having formed a certain affection for the Legionnaires as individuals and as a group, and felt they might need whatever moral support they could get in the conflict. As it turned out, I was right.
