   Unless, of course, Glenda had done something to them on    Vortex #6.    I didn't want to think about that. If that happened, I was going to be stuck right here for a very long time.    There was no sign of anyone on the road coming down the      hill. I turned and headed back up the sidewalk, doing my "Howdy" bit to anyone who passed, with the hit-tipping routine added in. When I reached the other end of town and the end of the shaded sidewalk, I stared off into the distance to where the road vanished into some low hills.
