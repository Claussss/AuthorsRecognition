   Stilman's head came up with a snap.    "None of that," he said sharply. "We mess 'em up a bit to remind them they're playing out of their league, but that's all."    "I thought Max said we could take the gloves off," the man said sullenly.    In reality, Stilman wasn't even sure that Max would approve of what they were doing. He had put this ambush together on the strength of her not giving him his usual order to "lay off the rough stuff." Taking a couple of the security guards out of action should be okay, but it was certainly a welcome change for the boys not to have to keep their hands in their pockets during a brawl. Still, Max was a woman, and Stilman was almost certain that she'd get upset if the crew got too frisky with the female Legionnaire.
