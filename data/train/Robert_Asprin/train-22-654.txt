The flattened ears of the misty horse flickered, came forwards. It lunged,  neck out. Teeth and hooves thunked into flesh. Screaming. Then screaming stopped. Tempus let the  horse pummel the  corpse awhile, stroking  the beast's neck  and cooing soft praise. When bones showed in a lightning flash, he backed the  horse off and set it at a walk towards the walled city. It was then that the lightning- came circling round man and mount.
