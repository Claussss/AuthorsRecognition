   As I was sayin' before I was so rudely interrupted, I am at a bit of a loss as to how to respond to this advance.    "Right now?" I sez. "Don't you want to talk for a while first?"    "What's wrong? Don't you like me?" she sez, startin' to pout a little. "Should I go peddle my wares somewhere else?"    "Peddle?"    "Watch it," she sez, flat and nasty. "It's a figure of speech."    I am vastly relieved to hear this. The only thing more depressin' to a sensitive guy like me than learnin' that a female is interested in him for his body and not his mind is learnin' that her real interest is in his wallet.
