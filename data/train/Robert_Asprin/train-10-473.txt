   "Maybe it's a thousand years of former royal family?" Aahz      said. "Look at that one."    He pointed at one skull hung on the wall, ornately decorated with gems.    I knew that wasn't exactly right. I could feel it in the energy in this place. After a moment I turned to Tanda.    "Can you feel anything odd in here?"    "Power," she said.    "An energy focus?" Aahz asked.    "Sure seems that way," Tanda said. "Or maybe there's something special about these skulls, something in them that magnifies the magikal power of this area and turns it into something different."
