"What do you think you're doing, legionnaire? Didn't I tell you to report for KP?"    "Sir, it's not my day," said the legionnaire, a puzzled look on his face. "I'm not on until tomorrow."    Snipe thought the fellow's voice sounded somehow different, but that didn't matter. It was obviously the same man. "Are you crazy or just stupid?" he barked. "I ordered you to extra duty less than two minutes ago. Now get down to the kitchen before I throw you in the stockade instead!"
