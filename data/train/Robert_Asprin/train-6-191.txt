   All in all, it looked like an incredibly boring existence. In fact, from my appraisal, the only thing duller than being a soldier of the Empire was spending days on end watching soldiers of the Empire!    I commented on this to Aahz as we lay belly-down on a grassy knoll, surveying yet another encampment.    "You're right, kid," he admitted absently. "Being a soldier is pretty dull work."    "How about us?" I probed, eager to keep him talking. "What we're doing isn't exactly exciting, you know!"
