"Saw  you  going  out  last night,  Shadow-spawn,"  the  taverner  said quietly, admiring the  silver coin  and trying  to be  cool about  it. "Musta been a good night, hmm?" "Aye. A good night. Aye! Don't forget my change." It was too late to do much of anything. He wandered a bit, hoping to catch sight ofTempus. He did not,  andhad to go back.  pretending notto hurry, to  check his new possessions.
