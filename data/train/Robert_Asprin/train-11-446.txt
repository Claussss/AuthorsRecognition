   "Well, Badaxe," Aahz grinned, "still want to join the team?"    The general licked his lips nervously, then tore his eyes away from Gus and Chumly.    "Certainly," he announced. "I'd be proud to fight alongside such... worthy allies. That is, if they'll have me."    That dropped it in our laps.    "What do you think, Skeeve?" Aahz asked. "You're the boss."    Correction. That dropped it in my lap. Aahz had an annoying habit of yielding leadership just when things got sticky. I was beginning to suspect it wasn't always coincidence.
