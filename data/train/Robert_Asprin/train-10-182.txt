   The area around us looked like desert, but the ground sloped      away from us down to a lush, green valley. A road came over      the hill beside the cliff, wound past where we were, and down      the hill to what looked to be a small town built out of wood.      From what I could tell there was no building over two stories      tall. The buildings seemed to be centered around the main      street.
