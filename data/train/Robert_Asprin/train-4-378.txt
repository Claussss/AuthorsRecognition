  The taller red team member closed his eyes, and the Tues were gone. In their places stood Aahz, Gus, Tananda, and Chumly. That's why I hadn't been worried... much.   "Nice work, Gus," I said, nodding my approval. "But I still think I could have handled the disguises myself."   "Have you ever seen a Tue before?" Aahz challenged.   "Well... no."   "Gus has. That's why he handled the disguises. End of discussion."
