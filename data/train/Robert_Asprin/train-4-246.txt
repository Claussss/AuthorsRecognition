  "I'll say." Tananda agreed with a laugh. "Where did you find those rings, anyway?"   "Bought them from a street vendor at the Bazaar."   "On Deva?" Chumly said with a frown. "Two spelled rings like that must have set you back a pretty penny. Are you sure you have enough money left?"   Now it was my turn to laugh.   "First of all, they aren't spelled. That was just a bluff I was running on their royal majesties. The rings are plain junk jewelry ... and I got them for free."
