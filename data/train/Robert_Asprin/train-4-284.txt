  I began having regrets over instigating this confrontation. Then I toughened up. What I had said was right and needed to be said. It flashed across my mind that I could lose Aahz over this argument. My resolve wavered. Right or not, I could have said it better... gentler. At least I could have picked a time when all our friends weren't watching and listening. Maybe....   Aahz turned away abruptly, shifting his stance to face Tananda and Chumly.
