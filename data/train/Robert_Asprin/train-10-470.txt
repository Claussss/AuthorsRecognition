   "This way," I said, leading the way up a short staircase and      onto a massive wooden stage.    On the back wall was nothing but wood slats. I glanced at      the still-open map in my hand, then moved to what looked to      be about the right area, putting the map back into my pouch as    I went. After just a few seconds of trying, I found the loose boards, pulled them aside, and we were back out of the light and into what I thought was another dark passageway.
