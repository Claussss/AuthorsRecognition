   The Geek didn't move a muscle, but now he was watching the knife instead of me.    "In case you missed it the first time around," Gus supplied, still smiling, "this â€˜punk Klahd's' name is Skeeve. The Skeeve."    The Deveel pinked again. I was starting to enjoy having a reputation.    "Why don't you sit down. Geek," Aahz suggested, "and tell the k... Skeeve... what he wants to know?"    The Deveel obeyed, apparently eager to move away from the knife. That being the case, I naturally let it follow him.
