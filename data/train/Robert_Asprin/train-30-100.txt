"I've got to  ask you, boy,  or watch you  commit suicide: you  can't fight this bunch. You trained with Stepsons; you  know that now they're drifting into  town again, things are  going to change.  You stayed out  of  trouble when  they were around last time;  now,  you can't.  They'll tan your  hide and  use  it  for  a saddle  blanket;  your polished  teeth'll  decorate some  war-horse's headstall.
