We had to map the energy patterns, and starting      where we knew a lot was being tapped seemed logical.    Suddenly I realized what I had been thinking about.    "Map," I said aloud.    Everyone sort of turned and stared at me.    "Map," I said again, smiling at them. I reached into my pouch and pulled out the magik map we had used so often to get into this fix.  If it got us here, it just might be able to get us out.
