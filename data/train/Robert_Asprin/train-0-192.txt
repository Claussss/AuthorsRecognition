"At least, there hasn't been before now. I invented it just today."    "And you expect him to believe that? What happens when he checks back with his family and finds out you're pulling his leg?"    "I'm about to take care of that," said Sushi. "I need to use the comm center gear to get a message to my family. They're going to plant the rumor that there is a superfamily, working to make the Yakuza more powerful and profitable than ever. As I said, these people take the long view. If they think it's to their long-term advantage, they'll play along."
