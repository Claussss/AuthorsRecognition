   The youth's face split in a sudden smile.    "Well, sir," he said, "I think I'll take my cue from the lovely lady here. Why don't you just call me `Trooper'?"    "Consider it done," Phule said. "Pass the word on that as well, and be sure to give everyone my personal thanks."    "Thank you, sir!"    The youth drew himself up and gave a snappy salute.    "Thank you, Trooper," the commander corrected with a smile, returning the salute.
