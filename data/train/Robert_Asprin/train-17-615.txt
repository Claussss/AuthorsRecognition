Swearoath, mentor (and father image?) to Hanse. The P-G did not like Tempus (and father image?) to Hanse. It was all  Hanse need do.  Just report what  he had learned  and now suspected. Then it was up to  Kadakithis. He had the power  and the resources. The men  and the swords. The savankh. Surely that was as far as Hanse's responsibility extended, to Kadakithis and  to Tempus. If he had any responsibility to that krff-snorting bully.
