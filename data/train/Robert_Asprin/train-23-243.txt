Of course, now that you're a big shot, I can't expect you to waste your precious time on my problems." Tambu drew a long breath before responding. "Look, Egor," he said gently. "Speaking for a moment as an old friend, you might ease up a little on your crew. If you did, a lot of the problems you're having would never arise."
