"NUNZIO," I said through gritted teeth. "I'm asking what YOUR opinion is." He averted his eyes and shifted uncomfortably. "Sorry, Boss. Like I say, this isn't easy for me." He rubbed his chin again. "One thing I WILL say is that I think you're drinkin' at the wrong time ... and I don't mean too early or late in the day. I mean at the wrong time in your life." "I don't understand," I frowned. "Ya see, Boss, drinkin' usually acts like a magnifyin' glass. It exaggerates everything. Some people drink trying' to change their mood, but they're kiddin' themselves. It don't work that way. It don't change what is, it emphasizes it. If you drink when you're happy, then you get REAL happy. Know what I mean? But if you drink when you're down, then you get REAL down, REAL fast."
