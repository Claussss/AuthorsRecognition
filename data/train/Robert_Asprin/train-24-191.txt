"Are you then claiming that had I not issued orders against contact with the Enemy that you would have given Ahk supporting fire?" She paused for thought before answering. "No. I still would have withheld fire." "It has become quite apparent since our landing that the hand-burners could be a decisive factor in any battle with the Leapers. Realizing this, I could not justify depleting the power of my burner to benefit any single individual. Rather, I would feel obligated to preserve its power in lieu of a situation critical to the entire team. Secondly, priority had to be given to getting the report of our scouting mission back to the team. Entering into needless combat could have jeopardized the delivery of that report."
