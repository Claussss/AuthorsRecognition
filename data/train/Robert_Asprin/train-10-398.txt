   Not a one of the men on the horses even seemed to notice      that there was now a green-scaled ugly Pervect standing in front of them. Not even their horses cared.    That was not what Aahz was expecting.    The guy again just laughed.    "You can drop the act," he said. "Our leader knows ex     actly why you are here."    Then the guy did something that just flat scared me to death. He pointed a finger at Aahz and a moment later the map came floating out of Aahz's belt pouch, unfolded in midair, and fluttered there. Then it refolded and returned to the pouch.
