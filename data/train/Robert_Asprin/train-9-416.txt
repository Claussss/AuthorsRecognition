   There was a sudden raucous buzzing at the door. I waited patiently, and in a few moments it stopped. I continued waiting.    "Are you still down there?"    "Yes, Ma'am."    "Excuse me?"    "Why didn't you open the door and come in when I buzzed you through?"    "Oh, is that what that was? I'm sorry, I didn't know. Could you... buzz me through again?"    "What's the matter, haven't you ever seen a remote lock before?"
