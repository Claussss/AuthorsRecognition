   My stomach did a flip-flop. I was getting a bad feeling about this.    "That's ridiculous!" called the Veygus spokesman. "We've never heard of another team. Whose team is this, anyway?"    "Ours," Aahz smiled. "And we're challenging both your teams to a game, a three-way match, right here in thirty days ... Winner takes all."    Bad feeling confirmed. For a moment, I considered altering my disguise and sneaking out with one of the delegations. Then I realized that option was closed. Both groups had stepped back well out of ear-shot to discuss Aahz's proposal. That put them far away, so that I couldn't join them without being noticed. With nothing else to do, I turned on Aahz.
