   "I wish I had thought to dress," I murmured to Kalvin.  "This is a pretty classy place. I'm surprised they let me in without a tie."    The Djin shot me a look.    "I don't know how to say this, Skeeve, but you are dressed, and you are wearing a tie."    "Oh! Right."    I had forgotten I had altered my disguise spell in the taxi.  One of the problems with the disguise spell is that I can't see the results myself. While I've gotten to a point where I can maintain the illusion without giving it a lot of conscious thought, it also means I occasionally forget what the appearance I'm maintaining really is.
