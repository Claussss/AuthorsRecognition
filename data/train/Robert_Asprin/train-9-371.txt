   "Enough! I get the picture! Let's go find a bodyguard." It occurred to me that if I listened to Edvick long enough, I'd either want more than one bodyguard or decide not to set foot outside my room at all.    "Good," my guide declared, rubbing his hands together as the cab commenced its now familiar swerving. "I think I know just the person."    Settling back in my seat, it occurred to me that Edvick would probably get a kickback from this bodyguard he was lining me up with. That would explain his enthusiasm to get us together. I banished the thought as a needless suspicion.
