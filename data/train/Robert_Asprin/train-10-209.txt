   The guy had the common decency to blush. "I'm sure we will work something out."      At that he beat a hasty retreat to the bar. Fingers seemed to be the preferred method of getting the food from the plate to the mouth, so I picked up one piece of celery and bit into it. It was soft, not fresh, and had a faint taste of horsedung.    I hope I managed to swallow it without looking too insultÂ­     ing to anyone who could see me.
