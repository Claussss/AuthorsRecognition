"I was framed," my partner retorted, but I noticed    his voice was a bit more subdued.   "We already know that." Impressed. "What I want to    know is why you didn't just bust a few heads and sprint    for home? You've never been particularly respectful of    local authority before."   To my surprise, Aahz actually looked embarrassed.
