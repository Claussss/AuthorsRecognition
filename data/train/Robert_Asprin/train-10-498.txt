   I was the first one through the door, with Tanda and Glenda      right behind me. Aahz took a moment longer, talking about something with Harold for a moment, then he joined us.    Behind the wall the space had been carved out of solid stone that was streaked in gold. It was warm and lit by the golden glow of the gold from the walls. The entire room was filled with old books, scrolls, desks, chairs, and more antiques than I had ever seen in one place. We were all inside when the guy slid the wall panel closed behind us without another word.
