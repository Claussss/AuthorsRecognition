   In a masterful display of control, I manages not to fumble with the key whilst unlockin' the door, and even stand aside to let her enter first.    Bein' a broad, she whips out one of those foldin' mirrors and starts checkin' her makeup even before I finish lockin' the door behind us.    "So," I sez, over my shoulder, "What do you want to do first?"    To be honest with youse, at this point I have no interest at all in creatin' a hassle. Instead, I am thankin' my lucky stars that a skirt like this would give a lug like me a second look, and hopin' we can get on with things before she changes her mind.
