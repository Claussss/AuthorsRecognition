   I considered my alternatives. I considered trying to lie my way out of the predicament. Finally, I decided to give the truth one last try.    "There isn't anyone specifically that I'm dealing with." I said carefully. "The fact of the matter is that I'm looking for someone."    "Oh? Then you're hirin' for your corporation? Out to raid some of our local talent?"    That didn't sound too good either.
