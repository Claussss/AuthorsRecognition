   Before Super Gnat could pursue the subject further, however, there was a sudden clamor from one side of the pool.    "Hey! Here's the man who can tell us!"    "Beeker!"    "Hey, Beek! Got a sec?"    The commander's butler, Beeker, had just stepped through the entrance, taking the common shortcut across the pool/firing range area to the captain's quarters. Unfortunately this might not have been the wisest move. Though the butler was notoriously closemouthed about the confidences shared with him by his employer, the crew was still quick to seize on any chance of information and swarmed to him like locusts after the last ear of corn on the planet.
