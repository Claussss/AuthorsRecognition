   Back at Zenobia Base, Willard Phule's wrist intercom buzzed, then Mother's voice came through the speaker.    "Hate to wake you up, cutie pie, but we've detected an incoming ship. You might want to tidy up before they get here."    Phule, who had been wide-awake {it was midaftenoon, after all) and working at his desk, grinned "Thanks, Mother," he said.    "That must be the party of bigwigs we've got to entertain for Ambassador Gottesman. Try to hail them, and patch me in when they answer."
