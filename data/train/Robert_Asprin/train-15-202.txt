"You will in time see the rewards for this hard work," said Beeker, standing up.    "I guess I will," said Sushi. "But a nice cold beer was looking good, too."    Beeker raised an eyebrow. "I can assure you, young man, that the beer in the bar will be just as cold when you have finished this task as it is now, and the satisfaction of a job well done will greatly enhance its flavor."
