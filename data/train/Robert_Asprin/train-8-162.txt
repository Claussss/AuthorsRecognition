   "WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ..."    These last words come from Corporal Whittle who has come alive far too late and tries to intervene after the dance is already done. The incomplete nature of his question is due to the fact that, as he is steppin' forward, he runs into a high swing from Nunzio's elbow goin' in the opposite direction, which effectively stretches him out on his back and turns his lights out ... and also stops his annoyin' prattle. For the record, this is what the earlier exchange between Nunzio and me was all about ... my makin' sure he was in position and willin' to cover my back while I dealt with the sergeant.
