   Perkin' up a little from these thoughts, I go lookin' for Nunzio, wantin' to be the first to slip him the bad news. Chapter Seven:       "To Serve and Protect ..."       TRADITIONAL MOTTO OF PROTECTION RACKETS    AS EAGER AS we are to get on with our assignment, which is to say demoralizin' and disruptin' the army, both Nunzio and me are more than a little nervous about doin' garrison duty.    Not that there is anything wrong with the town, mind you. Twixt is a bigger'n average military town, which means there is lots of stuff to keep us amused during our off-duty hours. The very fact that it is a sizable burg, however, increases the odds of our presence bein' noticed and reported to Don Bruce ... which, as we have mentioned before, was not high on our list of desirable occurrences.
