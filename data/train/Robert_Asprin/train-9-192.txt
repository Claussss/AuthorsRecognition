   If I had hoped to rebuff him, I failed dismally. At the sound of my voice his face brightened and he relaxed visibly.  "So it is you. You had me going there for a minute. You've changed since you checked in."    It took me a second to realize what he was talking about.  Then I remembered I hadn't renewed my disguise spell since I had my run-in with the law the night before. I suppose it could be a little jarring to expect to find a Pervect and end up talking to a Klahd instead. I considered casting the spell again, then made a snap decision to leave things the way they were. The Pervect disguise seemed to be causing me more trouble than it was averting. I'd try it for a day as a Klahd and see how things went.
