   "Bring me another of these," I ordered the bartender, who was still sorting through my coins. "And can you bring it in a larger container?"    "I could bring you a pitcher," he grumbled.    "Perfect... and pull a little extra there for your trouble."    "Say... thanks."    The bartender's mood and opinion of me seemed to have improved as he made his way to the bar. I congratulated myself for remembering what Edvik had said about tipping.  "I suppose it would be pushy to try to point out that you're drinking on an empty stomach," the Djin said drily.
