   He ducked out of sight under the bar, then emerged again and plopped a cardboard box next to Harry's beer.    "Take a look," he said.    The box was two-thirds full of wristwatches and jewelry.    The bartender smirked. "This is Lorelei, my friend. Gamblers will hawk or pawn anything to raise money for a ticket off-station-or, more often, another pass at the tables. When the box gets full, I run it over to one of the pawnshops, and I'll be lucky to get back what I paid for most of it. I just do this as a public service for our customers."
