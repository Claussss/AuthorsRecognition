   "Okay," I said, "but don't you think I need a little practice at this spell first?"    Aahz held up the paper. "This is the only piece of magik      paper we have. You only get one shot at it."    "No pressure," I said.    "If I didn't believe you could do it," Aahz said, "would I      be wanting you to try?"    I didn't think I should remind him he had offered the job      to everyone but me to start with. No point in ruining the mood
