   "Can you verify this?" the captain sez to the guard, cuttin' my oration short.    "Yes sir."    "Very well. Send word over to the infirmary. Tell the rest of the squad they are free to return to their quarters after their wounds are treated. Sergeant Guido and Corporal Nunzio are taking full responsibility for their actions."    "Yes sir," the guard sez, then salutes and leaves.    This is a bit of a load off my mind, as I have been worryin' a bit about gettin' the crew into trouble with our gambit. A bit, but not all ... as there remains the question of what the captain is gonna do about me and Nunzio. This is a for real question, as the stare the captain is levelin' at us is real noncommittal, which is to say he neither looks happy nor upset ... though I'm not sure what he would have to be happy about in this situational.
