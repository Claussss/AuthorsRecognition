    Since his back was to the bar, he kept the map in front of him so      no one else in the place could see it. Then, slowly, he opened it    It was instantly clear to me, as I pretended to love a hunk      of cucumber, that the map had again changed. It was no longer      a dimension map, but now a map of Kowtow.    The customers closest to us finished off their veggie plate      and got up to leave. That left only two other tables and the guy behind the bar. And at the moment he wasn't looking.
