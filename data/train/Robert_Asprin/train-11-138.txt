   "Stealing!?!"    The hands on my shoulders released their grip so fast I fell to the floor. Fortunately, I had the presence of mind to break my fall with my rump.    "I don't believe it! Stealing!" Aahz made his appeal to the ceiling. "All this because you tried to steal something."    My rump hurt, but I had other more pressing matters to deal with. I was desperately trying to phrase my explanation when I realized with some astonishment that Aahz was laughing.
