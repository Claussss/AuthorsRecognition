   There were three of them: the one currently addressing me, and two others who were talking to Nunzio.    "I dunno," the latter was saying. "I didn't get any instructions about anyone pickin' up the shipment early."    Something was definitely amiss. From his words and manner, even Nunzio was suspicious... which meant the plot had to be pretty transparent.    "C'mon boy. Take the treat."    The Deveel facing me was starting to sound a little desperate, but I continued ignoring him and his offering. It was drugged, of course. Just because humans can't smell a wide range of chemicals, they assume that no one else can either. This one was no problem. I was more concerned as to whether or not Nunzio would require assistance.
