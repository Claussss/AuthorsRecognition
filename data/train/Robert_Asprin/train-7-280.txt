   "What was Quigley doing when we first met him?"    "He was a demon hunter. Why?"    "And what's he doing now?"    "Last thing we heard, he was holding down a job as Court Magician for Ta-hoe."    "Now what do you suppose prompted him to take up magik for a living instead of sword-swinging?"    He looked a bit crestfallen for a few moments but rallied back gamely.    "I still think you should have found out what the problem was. Once we're in there, there's no telling how long it's going to take, and I can't be away from the office too long. I'm really busy these days."
