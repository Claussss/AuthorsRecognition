"At my command," Tambu said pointedly. "Just as we moved in on the ships at my command." "But like Whitey said," Puck insisted, "we all had a part in it-the planning and the execution!" "Ships aren't run by committee," Tambu reminded him. "That's why you made me captain. Besides getting the lion's share of the glory and profits when we do well and having last say on policy, being captain means that I hold the bag if things go wrong. It goes with the job. Isn't that right, Whitey? You were the one smart enough to dodge the captain's post. Wasn't avoiding responsibility one of your main reasons? Then don't lecture me about how I shouldn't feel responsible."
