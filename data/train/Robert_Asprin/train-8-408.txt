   I am likin' this less and less the more I hear.    "You mean we gotta fill all this out just to move somethin' in or out of the depot ... sir?"    "You misunderstand me, sergeant," he sez quick-like. "These aren't the forms themselves."    I experience a quick flood of relief.    "... These are just the instructions for filling out the forms!"    The relief I had been feelin' disappears like a single shot of whiskey in a big bowl of watered-down punch.
