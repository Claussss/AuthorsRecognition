   "About twelve hours," Aahz said. "We were just getting ready to head back to Kowtow when you started to wake up."    "Without me?" I asked, staring into the eyes of my mentor.    He smiled at what must have been my shocked expression.    "Just to explore and get a little closer to Donner while the vampires were back being cows. We would have left you shielded and been back in a few hours."    "You still want to see if you can get to the treasure?" I asked, not believing that Aahz would even want to go back to the place again, let alone try to get a golden-milk-giving cow that turned into a vampire.
