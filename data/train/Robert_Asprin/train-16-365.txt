"Please, Jonesy. If you have something to say, just say it plainly. We're trying to have a meeting here, not write fortune cookies."    "I believe there was an incident in the bar involving one of your men," Jonesy said calmly. "At least, we assume he was one of your men, since his medical expenses are being charged to your account. If that is true, then the results of that encounter do little toward justifying the confidence you have in your plan."
