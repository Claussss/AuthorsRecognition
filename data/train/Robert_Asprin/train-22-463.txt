If Illyra did not provide the answers at midnight, Walegrin resolved to take his men somewhere far from this accursed town. He  would have  continued his  litany of  dislike had  he not  been brought  to alertness by the distress  call of a mountain  hawk: a bird never  seen or heard within the walls of Sanctuary. The call was the alarm signal amongst his men. He left a few coins on the table and departed the Unicorn without undue notice.
