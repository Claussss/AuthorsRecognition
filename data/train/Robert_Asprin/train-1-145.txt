There were five left. Two with bows watched the remaining three. Amuuth, the Beast, and another waited at a table in the middle of the warehouse, a small lamp on the table giving the only light in the building. It took Cade ten minutes to kill both the bowmen; the others were not alerted. Cade lay on top of several crates, next to the body of the second bowman. From this vantage point he studied the remaining targets.
