   The Djin leaned back and cocked an eyebrow at me.  "Well, your mood seems to have improved, Imt I was under the impression you might want to talk about the Butterfly's advice this afternoon."    As soon as he spoke, my current bubble of levity popped and my earlier depression slammed into me like a fist. With out thinking I drained half the contents of my glass.  "I don't know, Kalvin. I've got a lot of respect for the Butterfly, and I'm sure he meant well, but what he said has raised a lot of questions in my mind... questions I've never really asked myself before."
