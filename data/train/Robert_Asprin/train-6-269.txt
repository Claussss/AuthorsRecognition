   Now I was stuck. I didn't have the vaguest idea how much mercenaries were normally paid.    "We... um ... we couldn't offer you more than one gold piece for the whole job," I shrugged.    "Done!" Brockhurst proclaimed. "With the current state of my finances, I can't turn down an offer like that no matter how dangerous it is."    It occurred to me that sometime I should have Aahz give me a quick course in rates of exchange.
