   It was the same answer Aahz had given the last ten times I asked, so I gave him my usual rebuttal.    "The reason they're sure is because it can't be stolen. At least half the population of Veygus will be looking, Aahz, and they'll be looking right at the Trophy we're trying to steal! Someone's bound to notice."    "Not if you follow your instructions, they won't," my mentor winked. "Trust me."
