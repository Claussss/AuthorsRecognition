"It fills this room, Aahz," Tanda said, the awe in her voice clear. "I've never seen an energy stream anything like it."    "We can do it," Aahz said. Again I looked at my little gold      shovel, then at the torrent of blue energy and just shook my head. Sometimes my mentor was smart, sometimes angry, but right now he was just plain crazy.
