'someone has made sport of me by translating "frejojan", "sister".' 'Perhaps,' the disguised woman said. 'What does frejojan mean?' 'It is  a term  of peace,  an offer  of friendship,  a word  to welcome a guest, another child of one's own parents.' 'Ah. "Brother" is the  word you want, the  word to speak to  men. To call a  man "sister", the word for women, is an insult.' 'An insult!' Wess said, honestly surprised.
