   "Very well, Your Majesty. By your word shall that creature be spared. Observe the other closely."    Actually, that was another little stunt Aahz had taught me. It's called a "magician's force," and allows a performer to offer his audience a choice without really giving them a choice. Had the king chosen Gleep, I would have simply proceeded to work on "the creature he had doomed with a word."    Slowly, I pointed a finger at Gleep and lowered my head slightly.
