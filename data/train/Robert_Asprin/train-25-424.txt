"Clancy, what do you know about samurai?" "Not much. They were bad-ass fighters as individuals, but not much as an army." "Do you know what happened to them?" "No. Outmoded when gunpowder came in, I guess." "Wrong-they got done in by a change in the system." "How's that?" "Well, they were professional bodyguards when Japan was essentially a bunch of small countries each lorded over by a warlord. Anyone who was wealthy and landed maintained a brace of samurai to keep his neighbors from taking it all away from him. The constant raiding and feuds kept them busy for quite a few generations. Then the country became united under one emperor who extended his protection over the whole shebang. All of a sudden the samurai were unnecessary and expensive, the clans were disbanded, and they were reduced to beggars and outlaws."
