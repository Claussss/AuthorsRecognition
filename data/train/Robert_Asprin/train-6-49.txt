   "Thanks, Aahz," I grimaced. "You're really doing wonders towards building my confidence."    "Now don't sulk," Aahz admonished. "You know how to levitate reasonably large objects, you can fly after a fashion, and you've got the disguise spell down pat. You're doing pretty well for a rank novice, but don't kid yourself into believing you're anywhere near full magician's status."    He was right, of course, but I was loath to admit it.
