For once, Crit was grateful for the witchy weather that plagued Sanctuary  worse than all the factions fighting here. "Getting Strat" was  not going to  be the easiest  thing he'd ever  done, but he wasn't arguing that the job was his to do: Ace was his partner; their souls were too bound up  to chance letting  Strat  die with  any strings on  him, no matter which witch was holding the end of them.
