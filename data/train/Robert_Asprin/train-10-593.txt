    I relaxed and just kept going, floating upward.    I went above the energy line I had used to create the other      map, through the roof of the castle, and then stopped, float     ing right over the top of the golden castle in the beautiful sunshine.    Below me rivers of blue energy flowed, coming up out of      the middle of the castle like a well, splitting and flowing off in      dozens of directions over the mountains and valleys.
