   "Ah ... go ahead, Ajax," I agreed.    Without further conversation, Ajax plopped down and pulled his cloak a bit closer about him. Within a few minutes, he was snoring lightly, but I noticed his bow was still in his grip.    "Now there's a seasoned soldier," Aahz observed. "Gets his sleep when and where he can."    "You want me to do a little scouting, boss?" Gus asked.    "Um ..." I hesitated, glancing quickly at Aahz. Aahz caught my look and gave a small nod. "Sure, Gus," I finished. "We'll wait for you here."
