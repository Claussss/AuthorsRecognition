   I didn't see what was so funny. Cows looked nasty to me, and I couldn't imagine trying to get milk, golden or not, from      any of the ones I could see.    By the time I was rested enough to get us farther down the road, a bunch of the nearby cows had sauntered over and were      gathering near the road watching what we were doing. It was      creepy, and I was glad to get on the way.    From that point onward there were cattle along the road watching us, as if something had told them we were coming. When I asked Aahz what made them do that, he said he didn't know.  He'd never seen cattle act that way.
