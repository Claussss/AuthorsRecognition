"So tell me, Mr.  Skeeve, are you a Klahd... or a Deveel masquerading as one?"    "I'm a Klahd... really!"    "... Who lives on Deva," the policeman finished grimly. "That's a pretty expensive place to be callin' home, boyo. Just what is it you do for a livin' that you can afford such an extravagant address... or to pay for expensive meals you aren't going to eat, for that matter?"
