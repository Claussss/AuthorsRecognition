A pretty boy, Crit had said. When she wanted Strat, who was not a boy, who was most certainly not a boy- She touched his face, worked a small sorcery, brushed the hair from his brow. He tried to put his arms around her, jerked her close- She pushed him away, both attracted and repelled-for all the wrong reasons. She said coldly, "There's clothes, there's money, take what you want and get out of here. I'll call you on another night. For your own sake-listen to me now."
