   "What's going on here?" the corporal demands, burstin' in on our little group.    I blinks innocent-like and gave him a helpless shrug like he was a DA during cross examination.    "We was just discussin' the logical-type benefits of social over antisocial behavior in a group situational."    "Oh yeah? Is that right, you two?"    The Flies try to match my shrug, but wince halfway through the gesture and have to resort to nods.
