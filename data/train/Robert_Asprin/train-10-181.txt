   Before we hopped, Aahz made real sure that either Glenda      or Tanda could hop back to this cabin. And he had Glenda help him set his D-Hopper so he could as well. It seemed I      was the only one who didn't have an emergency getaway. I planned on making sure I was always close to one of them.      Preferably Glenda.    After the hop, we ended up standing near a large rock cliff      face. The air was warm and dry, and the sun was high overÂ­head at the moment.
