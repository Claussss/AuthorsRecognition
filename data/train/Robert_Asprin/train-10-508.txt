    thing a long, long time ago. Now, in the weird light from the glowing walls, and all the dust of the years, it was faded and      almost invisible. But it was still there.    And the more I lay on my back staring at it, the more I realized that what I was seeing was the most important thing in the room as far as we were concerned. It was a map of the entire castle, only it wasn't a map of the current castle, but the layout of Count Bovine's castle.
