  "Why, a bribe, of course," I smiled. "A lump sum of a thousand gold pieces."   "I see," Grimble murmured softly. "And who's offering this bribe, if I might ask?"   I stared at the ceiling.   "Actually, I was rather hoping that, you would."   There was a bit of haggling after that, but mostly on the terms of our agreement. Grimble really wanted Aahz and me out of his accounts, though I suspect he would have been less malleable if he had realized he was only dealing with me. There was a bit of name calling and breast beating, but the end result is what counts, and that end result was my heading for my quarters, a thousand gold pieces richer in exchange for a promise that it was the last money I would ever receive from Grimble. It was one more reason for my being on my way as soon as possible.
