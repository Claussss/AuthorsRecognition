I sent Hoxa down to read the provisions receipts. One of the understewards is already under lock and key, and I've got the name of a place Downwind-" "You might have let me know, my lord Molin." Torchholder smiled pleasantly. "I couldn't find you." He pointed to his table; it was apparent that he did not feel up to standing or walking. "There ... Hoxa wrote it down for you. Take it as you leave."
