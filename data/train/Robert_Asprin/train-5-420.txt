   One card... two cards... three cards came gliding across the table to me, face down. They slid to a stop neatly aligned, another tribute to the Kid's skill, and lay there like land mines.    I ignored them, waiting for the next card.    It came, coasting to a stop face up next to its brethren. It was the seven of diamonds and the Kid dealt himself.. .    The ten of diamonds. A ten!    The rules came back to me like a song I didn't want to remember. A ten face up meant my seven was dead ... valueless.
