"Hi, Skeeve," Bunny said, sweeping past me into the room. "I thought I'd stop by and brief you on the latest budget developments and maybe do dinner and ... Hey! You look nice." Needless to say, this was an unexpected ... and unpleasant ... surprise. "Urn ... Actually I was just getting ready to go out." I managed politely. She took it well. In fact, she seemed to brighten at the news. "That's a great idea!" she said. "Hang on a few and I'll duck back to my room and change and we can go out together!"
