   "Yeah, I know," Aahz said.    "Oh, sorry, big guy," she said.    "Gotten used to it," he said.    I couldn't even imagine how Aahz felt, once being a powÂ­     erful magician and then having his powers taken away from him because of a practical joke by my previous mentor. My mentor had been killed before he could lift the joke. Now Aahz just had to wait for the joke to wear off and his powers to come back, which he said would take more time than I wanted to think about.
