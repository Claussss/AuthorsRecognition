Just look the other way for a few minutes and I'll pump it myself." The man shook his head. "Sorry, I can't risk it." "I'll give you fifty dollars for half a tank..." But the attendant was gone. Julian heaved a sigh and got back into his car. Once he left the station, though, his hangdog mask slipped away. Things were going well with the fuel boycott. It had been three weeks since he had had to report a station for breaking the rules. He checked his list for the location of the next station to check out.
