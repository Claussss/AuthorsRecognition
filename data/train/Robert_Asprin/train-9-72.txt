   I had ignored most of his chatter, which didn't seem to bother him. He apparently didn't expect a response, but this last comment caught my interest.    "Excuse me, but aren't you a Pervert... I mean, a Pervect?"    The driver nodded vigorously and half turned in his seat to face me.    "There. See what I mean?"    Frankly, I didn't. If there was logic in his statement, it escaped my comprehension. What I did see, however, was that we were still plunging forward without slacking our speed. There was a tangle of stopped vehicles ahead which the driver seemed obliyious to as he tried to make his conversational point. A collision seemed inescapable.
