   "No," said Griffin firmly.    "Now look, short stuff..."    "Wait a minute, Aahz," I interrupted. "Griffin, this time we aren't threatening you. I'm offering you a job at good wages to help us."    "What!?" Aahz shrieked.    "Shut up, Aahz."    "You don't understand," Griffin interrupted in turn. "Neither threats nor money will change my mind. I helped you steal the Trophy from Veygus, but I won't help you against my own team. I'd die before I'd do that."
