   "Kid! Get back here!"    Aahz's bellow reminded me there was another conference going on.    "I've got to go. Griffin," I declared. "Thanks for the warning."    "Good luck!" he called. "You're going to need it."    I trotted back onto the field, to find the assemblage waiting for me with expectant expressions.    "They want to see the Trophy," Aahz informed me with a wink.    "As per our original agreement," the Ta-hoe spokesman added stiffly. "It should be here to be awarded to the victorious team."
