   Slowly, my irritation began to give way to common sense.  Kalvin was right. If nothing else, I had heard that bellhops were prime sources of local information, and if being nice to this character would speed my search for Aahz, thereby shortening my stay on Perv, then it would definitely be worth at least a decent tip. Taking a deep breath, I caught the Djin's eye and gave a curt nod, whereupon he subsided.  It occurred to me it was nice to deal with someone who would let an argument drop once he'd won it.
