Where the  oak trees  thinned, a  grassy lawn  sloped down  to a  pool fed  by a gurgling waterfall. A table had been set there, covered with a cloth of  crimson damask  fringed  with  gold,  and upon  that  cloth  crystal  flagons with  wine ofCarronne,  platters of  roasted meats  and loaves  of white  bread and  silver dishes heaped with oranges from Enlibar. A feast fit for the gods, thought Lalo.
