Sorry to jump subjects on you, but what's your opinion of Sergeant Escrima's classes on stick fighting?"    Super Gnat chewed her lip slightly before answering.    "Truth to tell, Captain, I don't think they're doin' much good at all. The sergeant knows his stuff, but he's not that good an instructor. He just plain goes too darn fast for most of the folks to figure out what he's doin'... 'cept the ones like me who have had some martial arts training before and are just watching for the variations."
