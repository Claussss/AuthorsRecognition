"No!! I mean, I'm all right. Really. I just didn't get much sleep last night is all." "Uh-huh. Out tom-catting again, were you, Hot Stuff?" Normally, I kind of enjoyed Massha's banter. Today, though, I was just too tired to play. "Actually, I went to bed fairly early," I said, stuffily- "I just had a lot of trouble getting to sleep. I guess there was just too much on my mind to relax." That was a bit of an understatement. Actually, I had tossed and turned most of the night ... just as I had for the two previous nights. I had hoped that once I had dealt with the money problems I had been wrestling with, I could concentrate on making up my mind about whether or not to marry Queen Hemlock. Instead, all the factors and ramifications kept dancing in my head, jostling in my head, jostling each other for importance, until I couldn't focus on any of them. Unfortunately, I couldn't put them aside, either.
