   "Excuse me for interrupting, sir," the butler interrupted, "but there's a call waiting for you in the other room."    "A call?"    "Yes. On the holophone. It's from Legion Headquarters, which is why I deemed it necessary to wake you rather than simply taking a message."    "Oh, swell. Just what I need first thing in the morning. Just a second while I get dressed."    "If I might point out, sir, you're still dressed from last night. I commented on it when you retired, but you seemed rather eager to get to sleep."
