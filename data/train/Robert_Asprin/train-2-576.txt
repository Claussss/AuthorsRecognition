            I looked at the girl. She shrugged and backed away.             It looked like I was going to have to fight all of them. Me and the dragon. Terrific.             I remembered my skinning knife. It wasn't much, but it was all I had. As casually as I could, I reached behind me and tugged at my shirt, trying to pull it up so I could get at the knife. The knife promptly fell down inside my pants.
