   "I... I'm afraid I don't understand, sir. Why would you prefer a tie to a win?"    Phule opened his eyes and raised his head again, his face splitting in a wolfish grin.    "You weren't watching close enough, Beeker. We did win."    "Think about it. Our little Space Legion Omega Company, the dregs of the dregs, just held its own with the Red Eagles-the best the Regular Army has to offer. What's more, as far as the spectators were concerned, Escrima won his bout. The points favored Corbin because he knew the technicalities of the rules better, but it was obvious that in a real fight with no rules, Escrima would have made mincemeat out of him. On that basis alone, we were the winners before I even stepped onto the strip. In fact, the only event the Eagles won clearly was the drill competition-parade-ground flash that doesn't impress anyone with their fighting ability."
