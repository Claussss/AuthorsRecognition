   "So, have you two been on Perv long?"    The driver's voice dragged me back to the present my mind had been trying so desperately to ignore.  "Just got here today. In fact."    Suddenly, I zeroed in on what he had said.    "Excuse me, did you say â€˜you two?'"    The driver bobbed his head in acknowledgment.  "That's right. It isn't often I get a Klahd or a Djin, much less one of each in the same fare."  He not only knew how many we were, he had spotted what we were! Needless to say, the news was not welcome.
