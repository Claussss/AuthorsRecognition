Dayrne had heard of the stones, of course. He looked incredulously at Chenaya. "You stole it?" She nodded slowly. "Just the one," he pressed, "or both of them?" She tapped the diamond with a finger, indicating just the one jewel. "And this has something to do with why you can't or won't speak?" he asked again, and again she nodded. Dayme began to pace.

A sudden suspicion flared up within him. "What do you know about this?" he said to the priest. "You're Savankala's high holy-holy in this city. Is this why she left Sanctuary? Did you send her to steal this?"
