   "I remember being in this room last night," Glenda said softly.    The thought of her being here with a bunch of naked vam     pires chewing on her neck made me shudder.    "Then let's not wait for the music to start," I said.    I opened up the map and looked at it. Again, just coming      through the secret door had caused the map to change. Now the way out of here wasn't across the room, but up on what looked like a stage near the back of the room, directly across from the windows.
