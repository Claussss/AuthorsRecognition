"Like nothing you could ever imagine, apprentice," Aahz     "True," Tanda said, going back to staring at the drawings      on the ceiling, "but Skeeve might be the only one who can go      down there."    "I know," Aahz said, also going back to studying the roof      over his head.    "Exactly what do you mean by that?" I asked, not liking the idea that I might have to take that old corridor alone into the middle of the mountain.
