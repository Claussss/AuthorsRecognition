As she crossed the Avenue of Temples a young girl stepped out of the shadows and blocked her path. A small hand brushed back the concealing hood of a worn cloak, exposing dark  curls and  wide, frightened  eyes. "Please,  Mistress," she  said timidly, "a coin for a luckless unfortunate?" Chenaya realized she had forgotten her  own cloak. No matter, the street  people knew    her   well    by   now.    She   made    to   pass    the   girl     by.
