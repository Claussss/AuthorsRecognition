   "I hope you pay her well. Otherwise some other outfit might be tempted to swoop down and hire her away from you."    From his tone, I could make a pretty good guess as to which outfit might be interested in doing just that.    "Among other things, she holds stock in our operation." I said pointedly.    "Of course, of course. Just a thought. Well Mis...  Skeeve, I'm sure we can provide you with adequate financial support during your stay on Perv. What's more I hope you'll keep us in mind should you ever want to open an office here and need to open a local account." Pervects have an exceptional number of teeth, and Malcolm seemed determined to show all of his to me without missing a syllable. I was starting to get impressed myself.  I had known our operation was doing well, but had never stopped to assess exactly how well. If the banker's reaction was an accurate gauge, however, we must have been doing very well indeed!
