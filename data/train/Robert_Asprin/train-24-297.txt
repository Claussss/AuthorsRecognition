"I see the Scientists didn't waste any time discovering we were out of level," he said, not looking up from his work. "You heard?" "It wasn't necessary to hear them. I saw the Q-Box on the floor." "The what?" "The Q-Box. The instrument they were using to check level. The Technicians built it for them, so of course they use it to criticize our work."
