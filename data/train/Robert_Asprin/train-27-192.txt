Ischade  had given  up her  female prizes, rather than confront  Nisibisi magic,  pretending for  her own  sake that  she believed  the 'Stepsons' who came to claim Tamzen and her friends. Had  Roxane not  been leaving  town this  evening, she'd  have had  to wipe  the vampire's soul - or at least her memory - away.
