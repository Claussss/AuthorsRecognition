    me standing there in that restaurant kitchen was to scream and shout and call out her name, along with Aahz and Tanda's names.    Screaming would have covered up the panic I felt, but I      knew for a fact that screaming would have done no good. But      I still wanted to, more than anything.    I didn't.    My second reaction was to run like crazy out the back door, but then I would be a wanted man for skipping out on the lunch bill, and considering I might be stuck here for some time, I managed to not run either.
