I was interrupted by a telepathed thought from Kor. I looked at her questioningly. "Continue gesturing at the ground sketch," she continued to beam, "but unobtrusively scan the terrain around us." I did, and saw the cause of her concern. In an unusual display of predawn activity, there were Leapers quietly creeping into view out of the shadows around us. Both from their stealth and from the focus of their motion, it was apparent that not only had we been spotted, but we were the object of their ambush.
