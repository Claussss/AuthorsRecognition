"Mahz confirms Ssah's contention!" I was about to reply to this implication of my shirking of duty, when Zur's quiet voice interrupted. "If I may, Commander, there is no need for us to die. However, if the Black Swamp calls us home, there is much we can do for the Empire first." His assertion intrigued me. "Explain, Zur." "There is another species of the Coalition of Insects present on this planet. This means the fleets will be back. If we can survive long enough, we can rejoin the Empire at that time. Even if we do not survive until rendezvous, we may be able to gather information on the Enemy to leave for the Empire's use."
