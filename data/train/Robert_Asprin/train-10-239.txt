   What would I do if I got to the cliff face and they weren't      there, which was likely? It would be almost dark by then and      I would have to spend the night out in the wild. And, for some reason, that idea didn't sit well.    And what would I do if they never came back here? Should      I head for the city with the golden cow in it? I remembered enough from the map that the city's name was Dodge. I could work my way there, given time.
