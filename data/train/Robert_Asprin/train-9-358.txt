   "Urn... M.Y.T.H. Inc."    He jotted the information down on a small notepad.    "Your home offices are on Klah?"    "No. We operate out of Deva... At the Bazaar." He glanced up at me with his eyebrows raised, then caught himself and regained his composure.    "Would you happen to know what bank you deal with on Deva?"    "Bank? I mean, not really. Aahz and Bunny... our financial section usually handles that end of the business." Any hope I had of a credit line went out the window. I didn't know for sure we did any banking. Aahz was a stickler for keeping our funds readily available. I couldn't imagine a bank wanting to deal with someone who didn't trust banks, or to take my word for what our cash holdings were...  even if I knew what they were.
