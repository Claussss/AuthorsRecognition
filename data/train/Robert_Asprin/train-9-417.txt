   I suppose it was meant as a rhetorical question, but my annoyance at being embarrassed prompted me to answer.  "As a matter of fact, I haven't. I'm just visiting this dimension. We don't have anything like it back on Klah." There was a long silence, long enough for me to wonder if it had been a mistake to admit I was from off-dimension.  The buzzer went off, somehow catching me unaware again even though I had been expecting it.
