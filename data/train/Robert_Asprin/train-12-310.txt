   sion seemed to be dissolving into a family fight I felt I    had no business being present for. Apparently Massha    felt the same thing.   "Well, if you can't help us, that's that," she said, get-    ting to her feet. "No problem. A favor's not a favor if    you have to be argued into it. C'mon, Hot Stuff. We're    wasting our time and theirs."   Though in part I agreed with her, desperation    prompted me to make one last try.
