"I'm sorry about that, Bunny. I guess she just assumed ..." "That's the woman you're supposed to marry?" Bunny said as if I hadn't spoken. "Well, it's what she wants, but I'm still thinking it over." "And if somebody kills her, you'd feel you had to take over running the kingdom?" "Uh ... well, yes." There was something in Bunny's voice I didn't like. I also found myself remembering that while she had never met royalty before, her uncle was none other than Don Bruce, the Mob's Fairy Godfather, and that she was used to an entirely different brand of power politics.
