   "You must be the Great Skeeve."    His voice was a dangerous purr, but it still reverberated off the walls. He moved toward me with a surprisingly light tread, holding out his hand in welcome.    The crowd seemed to hold its breath.    "... And you must be the one they call the Sen-Sen Ante Kid." I responded, abandoning my hand into his grip.    Again I was surprised... this time by the gentleness of his handshake.
