            I tried desperately to think of a defense, but couldn't. I didn't even know what I was supposed to be defending against!             Suddenly, something flashed across my line of vision and the stick was gone.             I blinked and looked again. The stick was lying on the ground, split by a throwing knife, a black-handled throwing knife.             "Any trouble here, Master Skeeve?" a voice boomed.
