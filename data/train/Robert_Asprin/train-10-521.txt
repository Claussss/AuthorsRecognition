   Aahz was sitting at one of the desks while Tanda and I stood beside him when the wall opened up and Harold stepped in. Through the opening I could see daylight flooding into the main area beyond the bathroom. It seemed we had survived another full-moon night in the land of cow vampires.    Harold stepped in and glanced at where Glenda was still      sleeping. She hadn't moved at all during the night.
