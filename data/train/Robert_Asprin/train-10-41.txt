   "Why do I have a bad feeling about this?" Aahz asked as      he pulled out the parchment, unfolded it, and put it on the bed      so all three of us could look at it.    I had no idea what I was looking at, but Tanda seemed to.      She pointed at the upper left corner.    "That's Minikins' Dimension."    Even I knew that, since it was labeled Mini.    "So we start there?"    Aahz nodded. So did Tanda, for which I was grateful. If they both agreed, at least we had something solid.
