   My apprentice shrugged her massive shoulders.    "Okay. What do you want me to do?"    "Just keep an eye on those two and see that they don't get into any trouble while I think."    "Keep them out of trouble? At the Bazaar at Deva? Aren't Guido and Nunzio supposed to ..."    "Massha!"    "All right. All right. I want it noted, though, that I'm taking this assignment under protest."    I'm sure I didn't give Aahz this much back talk when I was apprenticed to him. Every time I say that out loud, however, my partner bursts into such gales of laughter that now I tend to keep the thought to myself, even when he isn't around.
