   He jumped as a voice behind him said, "Excuse me, sir, can I help you?"    He turned to see a legionnaire with a dark pompadour, sideburns, and night vision goggles hanging around the neck. "Aren't you supposed to be on duty in the command center?" he asked.    The legionnaire grinned. "No, I wish I was. Working there's got to be a lot more fun than running around in these stupid drills."    From the voice, Snipe realized that this one was a male. Obviously not the same as the one he'd just seen...except the face was uncannily close. Snipe shivered, then said, "I need to inspect the perimeter in Blue Sector. And don't assume it's a drill, either. This is a war zone, you know."
