   Not a bad idea, O'Donnel thought with a tight smile, running a totally unpredictable opponent at the champion by bringing in a nonfencer. Still, he doubted it would make much difference.

Corbin scored an easy win over his inexperienced opponent, though the victory was not as decisive as O'Donnel would have liked.
