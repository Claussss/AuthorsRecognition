   "Speakin' a theories," I said, "we got one that isn't goin' to work itself out without a lotta pushin' from us."    The vampire stretched his arms and yawned. "All right. I'll take care of the disco and the architect if you can start checking into the casino and the shops. Okay?"    I had to admit I was a little taken aback by his enthusiasm.    "You mean right now? It's pretty late."    He showed me his fangs in a little grin. "For you, maybe. Us night people are just starting to wake up, which means it's just the right time for me to start scouting around for a band and bar staff. Since we're on different missions anyway, though, I've got no problem if you want to catch a few Z's before you do your rounds. What say we meet here same time tomorrow for an update?"
