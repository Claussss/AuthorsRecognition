   "Is that true?" I said.    The policeman ignored me, leaning back in his chair to stare at J.R. through half-closed eyes.  "You seem to know a lot about police procedure, son. Almost as if you've been rousted before."    A sneer spread across the street vendor's face as he met the challenge head on.    "Anyone who works the streets gets hassled," he said.  "It's how you police protect the upstanding citizens from merchants like me who are too poor to afford a storefront.  I suppose it is a lot safer than taking on the real criminals who might shoot back. We should be grateful to our defenders of the law. If it wasn't for them, the dimension would probably be overrun with street vendors and parking violators."
