   Now, I haven't read the book they was chattin' about a second ago, but this is somethin' I can comment on.    "Ummm ... Massha?" I sez. "That may not be such a good thing."    "What do you mean?" she sez, her smile fadin' as she looks back and forth between Nunzio and me. "That was my assignment, wasn't it?"    "Tell her, Guido," Nunzio sez, dumpin' the job of givin' Massha the bad news in my lap.
