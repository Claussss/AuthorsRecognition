  "Welcome to Possiltum," I managed at last.   It was a considerably abbreviated version of the speech I had planned to give, but it was as much as I could remember under the circumstances.   "Hello, Roddie," she said without looking at me, still waving at the crowd. "I'm going to scamper off for my quarters in a second. Be a love and try not to get underfoot during the next week... there's so much to do. Besides, it looks like you're going to have your hands full with other business."
