   "Sounds good to me," Nunzio sez. "Let's get going."    If, perhaps, our attitude toward dyin', not to mention the possibility of maybe whackin' each other, sounds a little callous, I would suggest youse consider anew what it is Nunzio and me do for a livin'. We is bodyguards ... which means that along with our jobs, we accept the possibility that at some point one or both of us might have to die so that the person what we are protectin' does not. I repeat, it is part of the job ... and we'd be pretty dumb bunnies if that part of the job description came as a surprise to us after all this time.
