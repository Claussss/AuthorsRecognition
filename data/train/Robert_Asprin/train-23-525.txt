I was under the impression you already had a fair deal." "Maybe that's what you call it," Hairy snarled, his nervousness overcome by his anger. "But we don't see it that way." "Don't you think this is a bit extreme?" Tambu chided him. "There are formal channels for registering complaints. I fail to see why you feel you have to resort to such drastic methods to make your feelings known."
