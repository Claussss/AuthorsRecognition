   Before I could stop him, he strolled to the counter.    "Hey, Gus!" he called. "Mind if I take an extra cup?"    "Actually..." the gargoyle began.    "Thanks!"    Brockhurst was already on his way back, bearing his prize with him, some kind of a thin-sided, flimsy canister. Plopping down at a nearby table, he beckoned to me, indicating the seat opposite him with a wave of his hand.    There was no gracious course for me to follow other than to join him, though it would later occur to me I had no real obligation to be gracious. Moving carefully to avoid knocking anything over with my sword, I maneuvered my way to the indicated seat.
