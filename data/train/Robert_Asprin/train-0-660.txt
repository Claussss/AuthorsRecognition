   Colonel Battleax settled into the chair facing Blitzkrieg's desk. "I've been watching the news, General," she said. "You've been pulling strings again."    Blitzkrieg feigned surprise. "What are you referring to?"    "A news story from Landoor. It seems there were shots fired at the spaceport, presumably by antigovernment rebels."    "Landoor...that name is familiar..."    "Of course it's familiar," said the colonel, losing patience. "You went horse-trading to the Joint Chiefs to get a Legion company posted there as the peacekeeping force. You don't do that so often that you're likely to have forgotten it, unless you're getting senile even faster than anyone thought. You sent Phule's Company-Captain Jester's Company-to Landoor."
