"Can't you get it right!" Illyra snarled, thrusting head and shoulders through the anteroom drapes. The percussive chorus came to an immediate halt with an aghast look on the faces of the younger men and a knowing, concerned one on Dubro's. "Learning's not easy," her husband said cautiously, his blue eyes nar- rowed to unreadable slits. "What, then, is he learning? How to give me a headache?" Dubro nodded twice, once to his men who laid down their hammers and the second time to his wife as he approached her. He wrapped his arm gently around her and brought her into the anteroom beside him. Just as the forge was his true home-a place built to his scale and com- fort-so the scrying chamber was Illyra's true home and it made him seem an unwelcome giant scraping his head on the rafters, yet unable to sit, as the visitor's chair would not take his weight.
