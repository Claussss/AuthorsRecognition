"Your friend was right, leech. Someone has set a dark spell on you." Nadeesh moaned. "Hmm. And left a barrier. Perhaps you would think of an opening gate, opening doors, a cave with a wide open mouth ... no no, please be still but not stiff ... hmm." A little work discovered the impossible: the spell came from a dead man. One Marype, the son of a mage named Mizraith and long appren- ticed to a shadowy mage name Markmor. The problem was that every- one knew Marype was dead! Except that this spell is not that old. Marype is vehemently alive! Furthermore he's past the apprentice stage-past jour- neyman, by the Flame! Strick concentrated, began to sweat ... and soon realized that the severity of Nadeesh's affliction was because Marype had gained possession of something belonging to the physician.
