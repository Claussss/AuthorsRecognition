   "The civilian authorities are recommending you be disciplined severely ... that you be made an example of to discourage other soldiers from following your example."    I start feelin' anxious again. This does not sound so encouragin', and after a career unblemished by a single conviction, I am not eager to spend time in an army stockade. I wonder if it is too late to withdraw our confession ... and whether the MPs are still outside.
