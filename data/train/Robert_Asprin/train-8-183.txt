   "I mean, how come he's writin' poetry?" I add, just to get some kinda conversation flowin'.    "Lyrics," she sez, in a flat sort of voice.    "Excuse me?"    "I said 'lyrics' ... as in 'words for songs' He likes to perform in the local clubs at their open stage nights, and he writes his own material ... constantly."    "Is he any good?"    This gets me a small shrug.    "I suppose he's not bad ... but he doesn't play guitar, so mostly he has to sing a cappella. That makes his performance sound a little thin after listening to an evening of singers with instrumental accompaniments."
