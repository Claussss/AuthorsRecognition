   "Then what are the positions?" I asked.    "It's a five-man team," the Deveel explained. "Two forwards, or Fangs, chosen for their speed and agility; one guard or Interceptor, for power; a goaltender or Castle, who is usually the strongest man on the team; and a Rider, a mounted player who is used both for attack and defense."    "Sounds straightforward enough," my mentor commented.    "Can't you tell us anything at all about the play?" I pressed.
