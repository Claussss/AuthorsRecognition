We were on one of the elevated walkways overlooking a maze. The Warriors below were maneuvering the corridors utilizing the echo helmets, and pausing sporadically to fire at pseudo-Ant targets that appeared singly or in groups to block their path. The transparent walls of the maze gave clear view of the exercise, but what caught my attention was elsewhere. "Zur!" I beamed to my second-in-command. Because of the sensitivity of the echo helmets, we did not speak aloud in the training bays.
