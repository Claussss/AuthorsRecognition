  "I see," Aahz murmured softly. "Getting pretty big for your britches, aren't you, kid?"   "Not really. I'm very much aware of how little I know, thank you. But this is my assignment, or at least it was accepted in my name, and I mean to give it my best shot... however inadequate that might be. Now for that assignment, I need your help, Aahz... heck, I'll always probably need your help. You're my teacher and I've got a lot to learn. But, I'm not going to roll over and die without it. If getting your help means turning my assignment and my apprentice over to you, then forget it. I'll just have to try to handle things without you."
