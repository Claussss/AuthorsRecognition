Illyra began as  Lalo picked up  his brush. Then  Latilla began to  whimper, and Gilla forgot to listen to the S'danzo as she bent to comfort her child. In the  night the  mobs began  to drag  the dead  and their possessions into the streets to burn them,  but the sight of  scorching brocades or melting  gilt was too much  for many  of the  more lawless,   so the  devout took to firing houses without checking too  closely to  see whether  anyone were  left alive   inside.
