    Any other circumstances I would have enjoyed the feel, but      standing in the middle of a crowd with acid scales all over me      sort of deflated any thoughts of enjoyment.    Aahz just stood and shook his head, staring at the tent, until I was finished and Tanda had inspected my hair and neck and other areas for a stray scale. I didn't know that we had both missed one in my left shoe until I looked down and saw that my shoe was smoking. It was one of my best pairs, too.
