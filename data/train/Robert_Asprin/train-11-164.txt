   There was a moment of awkward silence, then I withdrew my arm from the translator pendant.    "Well, Aahz," I sighed, "how do we talk our way out of this one?"    "Put your arm back in the pendant," Aahz hissed. "He's getting suspicious."    "He's already suspicious," I pointed out. "The question is what do we do now?"    "Nothing to it," my mentor winked. "Just watch how I handle this."    In spite of my worries, I found myself smiling in eager anticipation. Nobody can spin a lie like Aahz once he gets rolling.
