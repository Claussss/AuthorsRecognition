   What she was referring to, of course, was her jewelry.  Nearly all the magik Massha used was of the gimmick variety... magik rings, magik pendants, magik nose studs...  hence the nickname within the trade of "mechanic." She was, however, polite enough to not stress too hard the fact that her toys were often more effective and reliable than my own "natural" form.    "You're right, Massha, and I'd love to have you along... but you're needed more against Hemlock. Before you get too worried, though, just remember I've handled some pretty tough situations in the past."
