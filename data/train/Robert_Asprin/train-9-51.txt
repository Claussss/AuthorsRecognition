Kalvin said, shaking his head. "Perverts... excuse me, Pervects... are feared throughout the dimension for their terrible, violent tempers. But you, you not only describe it as a snit-fit, you're willing to show up on Perv itself just to make a point. You're either very good or an endangered species."
