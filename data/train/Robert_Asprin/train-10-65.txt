    to have Aahz teach me the magik involved so I could do that with our rooms back at the palace.    The tent was dimly lit and had a polished marble floor and      dark, wooden-looking walls. There was almost no furniture.      A simple wooden desk sat on the side of the room facing where      we had come in. A massive map of what looked like dimen­     sions filled the wall behind it.    A woman sat at the desk, not looking at us at all. What­ever had Aahz and Tanda so worried about being here wasn't clear on first glance. The room felt odd, but not threatening, besides it being a hundred times larger than the tent holding it. We all stopped a few feet in front of the desk, with Aahz clearly in the position to do the talking.
