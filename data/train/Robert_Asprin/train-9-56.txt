   Coming from Klah, a dimension which excelled at neither magik nor technology, I found the writeup to be pretty impressive. Kalvin, on the other hand, seemed to find end less amusement in it.    "... ‘Despite ample proof... ‘ I love it!" he chortled.  "Wait'll the next time I see that blowhard."    For some reason, I found this vaguely annoying.  "Say, Kalvin," I said, "what does your book say about Djinger?"
