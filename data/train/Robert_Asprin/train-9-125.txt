   "Where is he going?" I said to the smug doorman, as casually as I could manage.    "To the front desk, sir."    "But he has my bag."    "Yes. I suggest you follow him closely. He's not to be trusted, you know."    "But... Ohhh...!"    I knew when I had been outmaneuvered. Apparently, all the doorman did was open cab doors and off-load the bag gage... not carry the bags inside. Of course, the fact that I had tipped him assuming he would perform that service was my fault, not his. Defeated, I trailed after the bellhop, who was waiting inside with his hand out in the now all-too familiar gesture that means "Pay or you'll never see the end of me." This time, however, I was more than happy to pay him off. Whatever Edvik had said, I had decided I would be better off handling my own luggage from here on out.
