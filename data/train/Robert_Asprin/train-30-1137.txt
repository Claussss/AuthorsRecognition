the Wine Barrel, as he was doing tonight. The Wine Barrel had  changed, even during Monkel's  brief time in town.  Much of the new money in Sanctuary was  being tunneled into its only readily  expandable food source-the waterfront. The fishing community was enjoying an  unprecedented affluence, and it was only to be expected that a portion of that wealth would be spent at their favorite gathering point and tavern, the Wine Barrel.
