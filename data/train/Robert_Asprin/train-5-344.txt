My pet's head snapped around, then he went bounding toward what he thought was a new playmate.    "Nunzio. I..."    Just as the dragon reached him, my bodyguard held out a hand, palm outward.    "Stop, Gleep! Sit! I said SIT!!"    What happened next I had to reconstruct later from replaying my memory, it happened so fast.
