"Speaking of that immunity, Tzu, what is the possibility that the Ants may have a similar exoskeleton?" She considered for a few moments before answering. "Unknown, Commander. The Scientist team is currently praying to the Black Swamps we never have occasion to find out." This surprised me, as it seemed contradictory to the curious nature of the Scientists. "Explain, Tzu." "The time to investigate the Ants would have been before they knew about our presence. Now that they know we are here, it is only a matter of time before they act on that knowledge. As such, the Scientists feel it is in the best interest of safety to complete our mission in the shortest time possible and depart. Our position here is tenuous at best, and it becomes more so with the passage of time."
