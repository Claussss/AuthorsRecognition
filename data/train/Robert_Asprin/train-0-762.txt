   "You've had plenty of time for meddling," snapped Eastman. He rose to his feet, his fists balled at his side.    "That depends on what you mean by meddling," said Phule, as calmly as he could manage. "Come inside and we can discuss it."    The two followed him into the office, grumbling, and he closed the door behind them. He directed them to a large couch, then perched on the edge of his desk and said, "Gentlemen, I have good news for you. I have just returned from a mission to persuade Le Duc Taep to end his rebellion. I'm sure you will be pleased to learn that Le Duc Taep is disbanding his army. Instead of trying to overthrow the government, the rebels are ready to do their part to build a strong economy."
