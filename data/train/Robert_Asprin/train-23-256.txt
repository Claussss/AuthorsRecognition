"Then it's a unilateral decision," Ramona stated flatly. "No one's going to buck you if you feel that strongly about it." "Don't be so sure. Sometimes I think some of the captains automatically take the opposite position I do just to be ornery." "I am sure," Ramona insisted. "And if you don't realize what's going on, it's about time you took another look at things. Sure the captains argue with you, because they know you respect people who think for themselves and speak their minds. You tell each person who signs on this force that you won't tolerate 'yes-men,' and they take it to heart. They'll argue because you tell 'em to, but don't kid yourself into thinking they'll go against you on anything big. You're Tambu, and you call the shots in this outfit. They wouldn't have it any other way."
