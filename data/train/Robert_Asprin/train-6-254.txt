   "Take your order?" the gargoyle asked politely, the smile never twitching.    "Urn ..." I said taking a step back. "I'll have to think about it. There's so much to choose from."    In actuality I couldn't read the menu ... if that's what it was. There was something etched in the wall behind the gargoyle in a language I couldn't decipher. I assume it was a menu because the prices weren't etched in the wall, but written in chalk over many erasures.
