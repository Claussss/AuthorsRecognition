   The master sergeant had the grace to look embarrassed.    "We didn't think they could come on that strong, sir," he muttered, avoiding the officer's gaze.    "Uh-huh. We got cocky and overconfident to a point where we badly underestimated an opponent," O'Donnel clarified. "If anything, Sergeant, we owe these Legionnaires a vote of thanks for teaching us a valuable lesson. I think we were damn lucky not to have learned it in real combat. At least this way, we're still alive... and we get another chance."
