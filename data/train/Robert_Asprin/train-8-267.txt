He teamed up with Isstvan against us back when I first met Skeeve ... and you're right, if he gets suspicious, a disguise spell wouldn't keep him from figuring out who I am."    "Maybe we should wait and try to run our gambit somewhere other than here," I sez, tryin' to keep the hope out of my voice.
