   "You're going to sleep for a long time," Tanda said, smiling at me.    Just her mention of sleep made me sleepy. I couldn't believe they had done this to me.    "Taking a guy's carrot juice isn't nice."    "I know," Tanda said.  "But we're doing it for your own good.  You haven't slept in at least three days.  You need to stop moving and just lie down."    The tiredness was washing up over me like a wave on the beach. It was everything I could do to even think about saying I didn't need sleep.
