   The top sergeant gazed at him levelly. "Are we talking about a transfer, sir?"    Phule grimaced. "I'll admit the possibility has crossed my mind... and you're the only one I've seriously considered it for. I don't like it, though. It's too easy, too much like quitting without even trying. I admire your abilities, Brandy, as well as your leadership capacity. I'm hoping we can work together, work with each other, not in opposition. The only way I can see that, though, is if there are some major changes on your part."
