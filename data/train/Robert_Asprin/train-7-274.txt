   I should have been suspicious right then. If I'm at all money-grubbing, it rubbed off from Aahz during our association. Anytime Aahz starts talking about giving something away that we could sell, like our time, I should know there's something afoot.    "Gee, Aahz, I don't think I could take the time. I've been really busy."    "... Levitating pencils and checking for embezzlement of funds that are all gravy anyway?"
