Her      eyes were closed, and if her chest hadn't been moving I would have thought she was dead.    "Wait," Tanda said as I started to get down on my knees to look for an opening in the wall under the bunk beside Glenda's, where the map indicated it would be. "We need to protect ourselves, not let anyone know what we're doing."
