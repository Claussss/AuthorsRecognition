   "That's about the lowest..."    "Hey! The name's ‘the Geek,' not ‘the Red Cross'!  I don't do charity. Folks come to me to bet, not for handouts."    I haven't thrown a punch at anyone since I started practicing magic, but I was sorely tempted to break that record just this one. Instead, I turned to the little girl.    "Get your things, Markie. Daddy's taking you to your new home."    My partner and I were currently basing our operations at the Bazaar at Deva, which is the home dimension of the Deveels. Deevels are reputed to be the sharpest merchants, traders, and hagglers in all the known dimensions. You may have heard of them in various folk tales in your own home dimension. Their fame lingers even in dimensions they have long since stopped trading in.
