   "Leave him alone," my mentor shouted back. "He's a neutral."    Actually, I hadn't planned on attacking him, but it was nice to know he wasn't part of the opposition.    I was the last of the team to get into place. Aahz and Chumly were bracketing me as the Fangs, Gus was behind me, waiting to take advantage of his extra mobility as Guard; and Badaxe was braced in the mouth of the goal as Castle. We seemed about as ready as we would ever be.
