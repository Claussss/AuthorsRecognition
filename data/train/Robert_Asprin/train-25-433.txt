"Now, as I was starting to say, we are a coalition of mercenaries. Our current employers are the people you refer to as the C-Block." Fred felt his flesh turn cold. Commies! They were being held at gunpoint by a pack of Commies! "We are relaying a proposal to you from our employers. What we are offering you is a lasting world peace. Now let me elaborate on that before everyone panics. In the past, when someone offers world peace, it's usually on their terms. 'Do things my way and nobody will get hurt!' Well, this isn't what we're saying. We aren't saying the free world should convert to communism, or that the Communists should go imperialistic. We are proposing a method by which both ideals can be left free to pattern their lives according to the dictates of their conscience and traditions."
