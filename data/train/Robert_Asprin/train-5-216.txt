   "Hey, Boss!" Guido called, sticking his head in the door. "The Geek's here to see you."    "I'll handle this," Aahz said, heading for the reception area. "You stay here and listen to what Chumley has to say. He's probably right. I have been edgy lately ... for some unknown reason."    "If I am right, then you should hear it, too," the troll called after him.    "Talk to me, Chumley," I said. "That's probably the closest you'll ever hear to an apology from Aahz, anyway."
