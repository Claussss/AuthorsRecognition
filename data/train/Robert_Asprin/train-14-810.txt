   "We know the article in question, Captain," Battleax interrupted, fighting a smile. "It's referenced frequently in your file. "    General Blitzkrieg was shaking his head in amazement and confusion.    "Is it legal? Doing business with an alien race outside the Alliance, I mean."    "To the best of my knowledge," the captain answered smoothly, "there is no law specifically forbidding such an arrangement. If we were at war with the Zenobians, it might be a different matter, but I don't believe there are any provisos for dealings with intelligent aliens that are not either in the Alliance or actively at war with us."
