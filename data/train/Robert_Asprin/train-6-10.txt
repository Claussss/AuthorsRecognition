   I winced at the deep, sarcastic tones booming close behind me. All my efforts were for naught. Aahz was awake.    I assumed my best hangdog attitude and turned to face him.    Needless to say, he looked terrible.    If, perchance, you think a demon covered with green scales already looks terrible, you've never encountered one with a hangover. The normal gold flecks in his yellow eyes were now copper, accented by a throbbing network of orange veins. His lips were drawn back in a painful grimace which exposed even more of his pointed teeth than his frightening, reassuring smile. Looming there, his fists clenched on his hips, he presented a picture terrifying enough to make a spider-bear faint.
