  Finally the door opened, and the four Tues filed out laughing and chatting together.   "Cute," I called. "Don't hurry or anything. I can worry out here all day."   One of the white team ran up and gave me a hug and a kiss.   "Sorry, handsome. We were having so much fun we forgot about you."   "Um... could you do something about the disguises before you kiss me again?"   "Whoops. Sorry about that!"
