   I nodded. Every time I asked Aahz to start teaching me how to dimension-hop he brought that problem up.    "I might be able to jump to a few hundred," Aahz said, "if      I had my powers back and I was close enough to them. Maybe      between Tanda and me we could find three or four hundred.      With a really expensive D-Hopper we might find another few      hundred on top of that.  But there are thousands and thousands of dimensions.  Maybe even millions, for all I know. The Shifters are the travel agents of dimensions."
