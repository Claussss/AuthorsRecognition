   "Hi, Tananda! What's new?"    Our cordial greetings, intended to disarm the situation, succeeded only in stopping our colleague in her tracks.    Tananda is quite attractive-if curvaceous, olive skinned, green-haired women are your type. Of course, she looks a lot better when she isn't pursing her lips and narrowing her eyes suspiciously.    "Well, for openers, I'd say the little girl under your arm is new," she said firmly. "I may not be the most observant person, but I'm sure I would have noticed her if she had been around before."
