   "Hey, Aahz," I blinked. "What do we need a bookie for?"    "To brief us on the game, of course."    "A bookie from Deva is going to tell us how to play the game in Jahk?"    "It's the best we can do," Aahz shrugged. "You heard Griffin. Nobody in Jahk will give us the time of day, much less help us put a team together. Cheer up, though. Bookies are very knowledgeable in spectator sports, and the ones here in Deva are the best."
