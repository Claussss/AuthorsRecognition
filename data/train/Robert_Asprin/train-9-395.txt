   The thought was enough to inspire me to voice my frustrations to Edvick and ask if he had any thoughts as to alternate methods of searching the magikal community.    "I was just thinking about that, Skeeve," he said over his shoulder,' "but I didn't figure it was my place to say anything unless you asked."    "Well, I'm asking. After all, there's no shame in admitting you know this dimension better than I do." That last was said as much to myself as to Edvick, but the cabbie accepted it in stride.
