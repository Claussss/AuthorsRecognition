straight on. Strat had "explained" about Stilcho  and Janni and Ischade's talent  for raising uneasy dead. Strat said it was a favor she did them, a gift to those who'd  died with their honor blighted. Crit hadn't argued-there wasn't time. Strat was addled, bewitched, and if he got through this  he was  going to  beat some  sense into  the big  fool as  soon as possible, do something final about Ischade or make her loose her hold on Strat.
