"But we'd better get back to that job we were doing, before somebody notices we're gone then we might really get in trouble."    "Just tell them you were bringing me something," said Phule. "And thanks-I think." He looked at the pile of papers, and his expression was anything but thankful. But Roadkill and Street were already out the door.
