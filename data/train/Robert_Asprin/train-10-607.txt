Clearly, as apprentice magicians, neither of us even had a clue what the other three      were considering.    "I think it might be done," Aahz said, nodding. He looked      at Glenda. "Good idea."    She said nothing in return. It seemed that as the closer we      got to a possible answer, the more sullen and reserved she became. I was still so angry at her for what she did to me that I didn't care enough to even ask what was happening.
