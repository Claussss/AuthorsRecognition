The sergeant left at a run. "I'll go with him," Stilcho said, and Strat caught him a second time. "She's not free." "If Ischade wants her out, Ischade can find Critias. Come on, man. We're going to go tell her that." Stilcho said nothing, only came as fast as he could, exhausted as he was. "Horses," Straton yelled, and the horses were waiting at the gate. Crit moved, tried to pull himself up from the upside-down position in which he had waked, in which he had already suffered hell, coming to soaking wet and staring upside down into the face of a lunatic with a knife.
