"Hanse," Mignureal said in an intense tone. "Hanse!" "Easy, Notable! Jileel-what are you doing here at this time of ni-" Hanse's nape bristled and he broke off. He had heard Mignue's voice, and knew it was Jileel, and yet he had heard more, too: it was that strange voice he had heard from Mignue, on a few occasions. Always when he was off on business; always when she had no idea as to his intent, much less his goal. He stepped leftward so that she had to turn. That way a bit of light from a window up the street showed him her eyes. Yes, and that eerie feeling enveloped him. Her eyes were all fixed and starey, really looking as if she weren't at home in there.
