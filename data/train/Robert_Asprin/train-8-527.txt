   "New bodyguard, huh?" I sez, not bein' able to think of anythin' wittier to say as I accepts the knife and stashes it.    "We met on Perv," she sez, a little frosty. "Skeeve needed a bodyguard ... and it seems he didn't have one with him."    Now I am not so far gone that I can't spot a professional rebuke when I hear one.    "We didn't like it, either," I growl, "but the Boss ordered us not to go along with him and asked us to lend a hand here instead."
