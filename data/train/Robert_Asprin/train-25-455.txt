Mausier felt weak. "And if I don't jump?" he asked quietly. Stills grimaced. "Now that would be unpleasant for everybody." Mausier raised his eyes to look at them. "Are you saying they'd actually kill me?" Stills actually looked surprised. "Kill you? Hell, man, you read too many spy novels!" Weaver spoke for the first time. "Look around you, Mr. Mausier. You're running a very delicate operation here. What happens to it if the phone company refused you service? Or if the people who manufacture all the gadgetry either recall it or refuse to service it? The Zaibatsu have been monitoring your scramblers for years. Suppose they publish a notice in all newspapers that in one week they'll publish a list of names of all agents still on your list of clients? Now, I don't like threats, Mr. Mausier, but if we wanted to we could shut you down overnight."
