   I kept moving, fighting down the desire to shout out Aahz's      name. And the desire to just run. I didn't know where I would      run, but for some reason running was a massive desire.    I reached the edge of town and stood on the last board of the covered sidewalk looking up the road that wound toward      the cliff where we had hopped into this dimension. I was sure      Tanda and Aahz would come back for me.
