He was more than surprised. "You give me an amulet, Termagant?" "I loan you a keepsake, Hanse." "I thank you, I think. Uh-is it all right if I tuck it inside my tunic?" For once, she chuckled. "Yes, Hanse, that will be all right." He nodded, one sharp brief bob of his head. "Good. Thank you. I am glad to know that Mignu-that Jileel is in good hands. The Termagant herself, and two big escorts." For the second time he had made her chuckle, even while she rankled at not having terminated their conversation before he did. A very nervy and decisive young man-and didn't he just love and perhaps live for danger and excitement! No tools or concentration were necessary for her to see that, not her. She well knew that her own abilities were almost equal parts intuition, and observation, and the S'danzo ability.
