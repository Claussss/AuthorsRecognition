   "Wonderful!" I grimaced. "So we can't set foot in the room we're supposed to steal something out of. Anything else?"    I was speaking sarcastically, but Tananda took me seriously.    "Just the magikal wards around the statue itself," she shrugged.    "Magikal wards?" I gulped. "You mean there's magik in this dimension?"    "Of course there is," Tananda smiled. "You're here."    "I didn't set any wards," I exclaimed. "That wasn't what I meant," Tanda chided. "Look, you tapped into the magikal force lines to disguise us. That means there's magik here for anyone trained to use it-not just us, anyone. Even if none of the locals are adept, there's nothing stopping someone from another dimension from dropping in and using what's here."
