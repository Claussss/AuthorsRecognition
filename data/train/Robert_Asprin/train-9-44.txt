   "Not a chance," I said firmly. "Let's go back to my original request. Can you advise me on how to find Aahz?"    "I might have a few ideas on the subject," the Djin admitted.    "Have you tried a phone book?"    By now suspicion had grown into full-blown certainty.  My hidden ace had turned out to be a deuce... no, a joker. If I was counting on Kalvin for the difference between success and failure, I was in a lot of trouble.  Until now I had taken finding Aahz for granted, and had only been worrying about what to say once we were face-to face. Now, looking at the streets and skyscrapers of Perv, I was painfully aware that just finding Aahz was going to be harder than I thought... a lot harder!
