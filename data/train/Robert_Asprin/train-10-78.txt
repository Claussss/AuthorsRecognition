Moving toward us."    "I must have missed it," Aahz said, and looked at me.    All I could do was shake my head and shrug. I hadn't seen      anything either, but Tanda seemed a bit spooked.    I got a pretty decent fire in the middle of the dirt floor, using nothing but my mind and a bunch of wood, as Tanda put a containment field around the room to keep out the wind.
