Meanwhile, if I may recite from a rondel I completed before you found me - 'Each sword of sorrow that would maim or slay, 	 My lady of  the morning deftly parries. 	 Yet gods forbid I be the one she marries! 	 I rise from bed the latest hour I may. 	 My lady comes to me like break of day; 	 I dream in darkness if it chance she tarries.'
