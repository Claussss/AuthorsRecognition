Groaning slightly and burrowing into my pillow, I tried to gather my thoughts. What was going on here? What happened to make me feel ... Suddenly, the memory of the previous night flashed across my mind ... or, at least, the beginning of it. The blind date ... The Wooden Stake ... the admiring crowds ... Cassandra! I sat bolt upright and ... Big mistake. BIG mistake. Every pain and queasiness I had been feeling slammed into me threefold. With a moan, I fell limply back onto my pillow heedless of the new unpleasant sensations this move caused. You could only feel so miserable, and I had bottomed out. Nothing could make me feel worse. Forget any effort at rational thought. I was just going to lie there until my head cleared or I died ... whichever came first.
