   I was setting my hat on a rock when I saw the glint of metal tucked down in a crack in the rock. I glanced around, but no one was watching, so I leaned down and looked closer, not believing my eyes. There, tucked into an opening in one      rock, was a short metal cylinder, like nothing I had seen in this dim     ension so far.      It was the D-Hopper.    I carefully pulled it out, noticing that a folded piece of paper came with it. The map!
