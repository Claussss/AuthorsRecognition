   "This is a strange place."    Glenda agreed and we started off down the hill, four strang­     ers walking into a town full of cowboys. I just hope my dis­     guises worked. Just in case, I stayed real close to Glenda. Not that that was a hardship or anything.    The town of Evade was active and primitive. The only street was appropriately enough called Main Street. It was dirt and hardened mud and very rough. It split two rows of wooden buildings with covered wooden sidewalks in front of them. Outside the main street were houses scattered through the farmlands, tucked into groves of strange-looking trees.
