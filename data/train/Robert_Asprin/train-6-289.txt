   "I thought Gremlins didn't exist," I commented casually to Gus.    "A lot of folks think that," the gargoyle agreed. "But you can see for yourself, they're real."    I wasn't sure. In the split second I had taken my eyes off the Gremlin to speak with Gus, he had vanished without a trace. I was tempted to go looking for him, but Gus was talking again.    "Just a second and I'll introduce you to my partner," he was saying. "He's here somewhere."
