   Of course, one cannot expect wonders from a Klahd raised by a Pervert, can one... hmmm?? Well, Chumley old boy, time to muddle through one more time, what?    I must admit this latest collection assignment for Tananda had me worried. At her best little sister tends to lack tact, and lately...    As near as I can tell, there was bad blood building between her and Bunny. They had never really hit it off well, but things had gotten noticeably sticky since Don Bruce's niece set her cap for Skeeve. Not that little sister had any designs on the lad herself, mind you. If anything, her feelings toward him are more sisterly than anything else... Lord help him. Rather it seems that it's Bunny's tactics that are setting Tananda's teeth on edge.
