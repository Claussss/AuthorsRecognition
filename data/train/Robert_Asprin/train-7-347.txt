   Not wishing to pursue the subject further, I gathered up a handful of proposals.    "Right now, I've got to go through these proposals a couple more times until I've got them straight in my mind."    "What's the problem? Just pick the best one and go with it."    I grimaced bitterly.    "It's not that easy. With some of these proposals, it's like comparing apples and oranges. One offers an ongoing percentage of profits... another is quoting a high purchase price, but wants to pay in installments... there are a handful that are offering stock in other businesses in addition to cash... it's just not that easy to decide which is actually the best offer."
