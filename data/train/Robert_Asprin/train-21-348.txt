"Basically, Bunny," I said, "I wanted to apologize to you." "For what?" she seemed genuinely puzzled. "For how I acted this morning ... or whenever it was that I woke up." "Oh that," she said, looking away. "There's no need to apologize. Everyone gets a bit out of sorts when they have a hangover." It was nice of her to say that, but I wasn't about to let it slide. "No, there's more to it than that, Bunny. You tried to raise some valid concerns about my health and well being, and I gave you a rough time because I wasn't ready to hear what you were saying. I guess I didn't want to hear it. With everything else I've been trying to sort out, I really didn't want one more problem to complicate things."
