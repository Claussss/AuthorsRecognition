   Harry's eyes flickered over to the older woman he had been ignoring so far.    "Her? She's `the Man' up here?"    "Be-lieve or be dead," the bartender said, flashing a tight smile. "You may have heard that someone called Max is running things. Well, that's short for 'Maxine,' and that's her. She's got a piece of every casino on this station and is real good at keeping the tourists in and the competition out. I'll tell you, C.H., if you start thinking about picking up some extra change with a bit of part-time larceny here on Lorelei, you don't worry about the cops-you look over your shoulder for Max. She does hire free-lancers from time to time, by the way, but ain't real tolerant of independents, if you know what I mean."
