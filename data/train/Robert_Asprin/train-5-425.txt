   The dragon of spades to me, and the ogre of hearts to the Kid.    No apparent help for either hand ....xcept that now the Kid had three hearts face up.    We both studied each other's cards for a few moments.    "I'll admit I can't figure out what you're betting, Skeeve," my opponent sighed. "But this hand's worth fifty."    "...And up fifty."    Instead of responding, the Kid leaned back in his chair and stared at me.
