   "Yeah, kid?"    "What's your honest appraisal of my chances?"    There was a moment of silence before he answered.    "Kid, you know how you're always complaining that I keep tearing down your confidence?"    "Well, for both our sakes, don't push too hard for my honest appraisal."    I didn't.    Getting through the back gate proved to be no problem ... mostly because there wasn't a back gate. To my surprise and Aahz's disgust, the wall did not extend completely around the palace. As near as I could see, only the front wall was complete. The two side walls were under construction, and the back wall was nonexistent. I should clarify that. My statement that the side walls were under construction was an assumption based on the presence of scaffolding at the end of the wall rather than by the observation of any activity going on. If there was any work being performed, it was being done carefully enough not to disturb the weeds which abounded throughout the scaffolding.
