   "All right, Tusk. Then give me your communicator."    "Give it to me, then get back to your position."

"I thought he was supposed to be a pacifist," O'Donnel said, watching the Voltron go.    "So did I," Phule acknowledged absently as he worked the communicator's settings. "All right, Major. I've keyed this thing for a beeper cue so it won't give your position away when it goes off. Three beeps means we need you, then press this side lever here to go into talk/receive mode for specific instructions. Except for that, don't touch any of the controls. If you're not familiar with the unit, you might end up making noise at someone's else's position by mistake. Clear?"
