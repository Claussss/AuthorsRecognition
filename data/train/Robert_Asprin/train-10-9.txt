   That's when I decided to try something really stupid. I decided to try to outwit Aahz and trick him into taking me dimension traveling again.    An item had come to hand that I thought might be just the ticket, so one afternoon when he seemed a bit bored himself, I      sprang it on him.    "Aahz," I said, holding out a folded piece of parchment to      him, "I think you should take a look at this."
