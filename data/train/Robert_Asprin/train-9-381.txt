   I was barely in time.    My bodyguard had a sinister looking weapon out and was drawing a bead on J.R. almost before I could say anything.  At the sound of my warning, however, all movement froze and she shot me a vaguely quizzical look.  "It's all right," I said hastily. "He's a friend of mine. He' s coming over because I waved at him as we pulled up."    The weapon vanished as she gave the street vendor a hard, appraising look.
