   Apprentices hate the candle drill. I did when I was an apprentice. It's a lot more fun when you're on the teaching end.    "Come on, Skeeve. I'm getting too old to learn this stuff."    "And you're getting older the longer you stall, apprentice. Remember, you came to me to learn magic.  Just because we've gotten distracted from time to time doesn't mean I've forgotten completely. Now light the candle."
