   "... Once a night, a player can change the suit of one of his up cards...."    "... Every five hands, the sequence of cards is reversed, so the low cards are high and vice-versa...."    "... Threes will be dead all night and treated as blank cards...."    "... And once a four-of-a-kind is played, that card value is also dead...."    "... Unless it's a wild card, then it simply ceases to be wild and can be played normally...."
