   "There you are. Boss! Good. I was hopin' you were still up."    I cleared my mind to find one of my bodyguards entering the room.    "Oh. Hi, Guido. How did the report go?"    "Couldn't be better. In fact, Don Bruce was so happy he sent you a little present."    In spite of my worries, I couldn't help smiling. At least something was going right.    "That's great," I said. "I could use a little cheering up just now."
