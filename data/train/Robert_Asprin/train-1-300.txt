"He's not here, I said." "But the problems are, and you're short-handed, so they say up at the guild hostel." "Who sent you?" Bluntly put. If this fighter was a mere, as he said, the guild records could tell him something about the man he was looking at -if Crit needed to know any more. A quirked smile that showed no teeth. "Your need, for certain-and the Riddler's. The Storm God, if you like." Crit hated this sort of innuendo- The man he was looking at was of a fighting class not usually under his command, and if the newcomer was staying in Sanctuary, some accommodation between them would have to be made. The last thing he needed was a man like this working against him. And if he was what he seemed-an acquaintance of Tempus-then he might represent a light at the end of Crit's personal tunnel.
