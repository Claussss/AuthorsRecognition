   "Yeah, me too."    "Pretend to eat and I'll see if I can get some answers" she said.    She stood and moved over to where the man stood behind      bar. I couldn't tell what she was saying, but after a moment he laughed and looked at me as if I were the brunt of a joke. I pretended to bite and chew on a asparagus spear and just smiled back.    At that moment Aahz and Tanda came in. They glanced first at Glenda, then saw me and came over and sat down in the other two chairs, their backs to the main part of the room.
