   "Well, if you don't mind, there's another possibility I'd like to try."    "What's that, Massha?"    "Tell me, Big Julie, is General Badaxe still running the army?"    "Hugh? Sure is. He's a fast learner, that one. Remembers mostly everything I've taught him about runnin' an army."    "Well," Massha sez, heaving herself to her feet, "I think I'll just wander off and try to find his headquarters. He had quite a thing for me the last time I was through. Maybe if I look him up again, I can get his mind off running the army for a while, or at least distract him enough that they won't be quite so efficient."
