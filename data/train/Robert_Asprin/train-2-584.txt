                         "Okay, shrimp! Let's see you stop this!"             I jerked my attention back to the leader. He was standing now, confidently holding aloft a stick. Yesterday it wouldn't have fazed me, but knowing what I did now, I froze. I didn't know what model it was, but apparently the leader was confident its powers would surpass             He grinned evilly and slowly began to level the stick at me.
