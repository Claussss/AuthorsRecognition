   For several reasons I figure it would be wisest not to admit the true relationship Nunzio and me has with Massha.    "She was with the general when I met him at court, sir," I sez, sorta truthfully.    "You've been to the Royal Court?"    "Yes sir ... but it was a while back ... just before the king married Queen Hemlock."    "I see," the officer sez, thoughtful-like, then sets the paper he was holdin' aside and starts rummagin' again.
