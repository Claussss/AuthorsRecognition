   I pointed to my next finger.    "Dimension where we had to be four feet tall and where I      bought the map." I held up the three fingers. 'That many in front of the game dimension."    I wanted to add that I could go over them again if Aahz wanted, but he was clearly not happy with me, so I didn't offer.    Tanda smiled. "I thought so. Mini."    "So what's so special about that dimension?" I asked. It hadn't seemed like much to me, although Tanda had not wanted to stay there long on our shopping trip.
