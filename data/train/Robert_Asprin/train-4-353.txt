  "So what are the odds tonight?"   The Deveel grimaced.   "Lousy. It's one of those Badaxe and the King matchups, if I was following your example right. In this case, the team you'll see in red trunks are Badaxe.   They're hotter than a ten dollar laser and have won their last fifteen bouts. The weak sisters ... the King to you... will be in white trunks and haven't won a bout in two years. When the Mob put their bet down, the odds were running about two hundred to one against the whites." I whistled softly.
