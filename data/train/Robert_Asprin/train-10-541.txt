   "I'm puzzled," Aahz said, "How did you get him to lie that      there was a cow here who gave gold milk and draw a treasure map to it?"    "It never says anything about a cow giving gold milk," Harold said, laughing. "I'm the cow the map leads to, and I was willing to give anyone a lot of gold if they found me."    "Makes sense to me," Tanda said, laughing.    I was enjoying the different emotions playing over my mentor's face. We had deciphered the map, found the cow, and were entitled to the gold. That made Aahz's mouth water, I could tell. But, at the same time, getting the gold out of here, with all our blood still inside our bodies, was going to be another matter.
