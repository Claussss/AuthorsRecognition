   A brief smile flitted across Phule's face.    "I think I'll follow normal procedure, anyway ... just for practice. Give me a broadcast channel."    "You got it, Big Daddy. We're all ears."    Without thinking, Phule dropped into a deeper, formal voice as he began his announcement.    "If I could have your attention for a moment ... I have been told that some of you are worried about the recent call from Legion Headquarters. All I can tell you at the moment is that we are being reassigned. I repeat, we are being reassigned ... That's the entire unit. Details will be provided at a formal briefing tonight at twenty hundred hours. Officers, please stand by. Your presence will soon be required for a strategy session. That is all."
