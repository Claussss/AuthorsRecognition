   If he hassles you any, go get Rev to write out a requisition for it."    Do-Wop smirked. "If he hassles me any, I'll just figure out some way to skank it.

We don't have to explain where it came from if somebody sees us using it, and people aren't shooting us the evil eyeball when we really need to do something without being noticed."
