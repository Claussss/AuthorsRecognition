   I was counting out my own chips when something occurred to me.    "How much is that worth?" I said, pointing at the mint.    That surprised my opponent.    "What? The mint? One copper a roll. But you don't have to..."    Before he had finished speaking I added a small coin to my chips, pushed them into the center of the table, grabbed his mint, and popped it into my mouth.    This time the audience actually gasped before lapsing into silence. For several heartbeats there was no sound in the room except the mint crunching between my teeth. I almost regretted my bold move. The mint was incredibly strong.
