In the dream, Shawme had been back in Ratfall where no one had a future and no one had a past, not a chance or a hope. Except Zip. And Zip didn't pay any mind to the youngsters.

As the dream's terror fled, joy filled her and crested into exultation. She was really here! She'd made it out of Ratfall!
