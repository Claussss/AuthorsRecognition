   "I ... we need ... a room."    "There aren't any available."    Frumple starts to turn away, only to find his movement is restricted ... specifically by my cousin who has reached across the bar and taken hold of his shoulder.    "Give him a room," Nunzio sez, soft-like.    Now, when Nunzio talks quiet like that, it usually means he is about to lose his temper ... which, in this case, is understandable. I mean, we have put an awful lot of trouble into this setup to have it thwarted by anything silly like room availability.
