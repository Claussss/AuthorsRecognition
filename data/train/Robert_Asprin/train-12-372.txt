   no way to increase our weight, unless....   When Aahz first taught me to fly, he explained the    process as "levitation in reverse." That is, instead of    using the mind to lift objects, you push against the    ground and lift yourself. Focusing my reservoir of magi-    cal energy, I used a small portion to try flying in reverse.    Instead of pushing up, I pushed down!   Okay. So I was desperate. In a crisis, I'll try anything,
