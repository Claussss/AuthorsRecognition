   Super Gnat assumed the relaxed warmth of an icicle, but Phule was unruffled.    "Good evening, Top," he said. "I assume you're here about Tusk-anini?"    "Oh no... well, in a way, I guess. Actually I was looking for Super Gnat. The troops said she was headed this way. "    "You found me."    "Well, the way it is, Gnat, I think I owe you an apology."    "An apology?"    "Yeah. I've been thinking about what happened, and the truth of the matter is, I was out of line. Not that I meant any harm, mind you, but I guess I never stopped to consider how much the teasing really bothers you. Heck, if anyone should know what it's like to be needled about size, it's me. Anyway, I should know better, so I want to apologize. I'll try to watch it in the future."
