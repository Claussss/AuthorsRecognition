   Following my system, I folded the next two hands, then hit them hard on the third. Most of the other players folded rather than question my judgment.    Grunk stayed until the bitter end, hoping I was bluffing.    It turned out that I was (my hand wasn't all that strong), but that his hand was even weaker. Another stack of chips tumbled into my hoard.    "That does it for me," Grunk said, pushing his remaining chips toward the Geek. "Cash me in."
