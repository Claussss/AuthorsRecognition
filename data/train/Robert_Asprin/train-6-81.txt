Just do your thing like I showed you and everything should come out fine."    "But if the other magicians-"    Aahz stopped short and turned to face me.    "Look, kid," he said seriously, "just because I keep telling you you've got a long way to go before you're a master magician doesn't mean you're a hack! I wouldn't have encouraged you to show up for this interview if I didn't think you were good enough to land the job."
