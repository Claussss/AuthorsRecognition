The captain was wearing a white dinner jacket with a plaid bow tie and matching cummerbund-appropriate attire for greeting customers at the Fat Chance Casino, but a bit out of place in the field.

"Armstrong, see if the major wants something to drink," he said, then grinned and added, "it's on the house."
