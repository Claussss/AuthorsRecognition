   The gang leader had turned and trotted out ahead of the others a few paces.    "Cute. Real cute," he called, turning to face me again.  "Hadn't figured you for magik. Well, let's see how you handle this, wise guy!"    With that, he pulled what looked like a couple of blackboard erasers from the pocket of his jacket. At first, I thought he was going to try to throw them at me, but instead he clapped them together over his head, showering himself with what appeared to be white chalk dust. It would have been funny... if he hadn't looked so grim as he started for me again.
