  Robert Asprin   Myth-ion Improbable Author's Note    If this book is your first exposure to the Myth-Adventures of      Aahz and Skeeve, there is no reason for you to read this note.

Specifically, as to why you are      now holding this volume instead of the long-awaited, long-promised episode titled Something M.Y.T.H. Inc.
