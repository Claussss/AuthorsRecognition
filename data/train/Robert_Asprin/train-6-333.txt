   There was a man standing on the tower's platform, his standard leaning against the railing beside him. Suddenly, his standard toppled over, apparently breaking off a handspan from its crosspiece. The man bent and retrieved the bottom portion of the pole, staring with apparent confusion at the broken end.    "Any other targets?" Ajax asked.    He was leaning casually on his bow, his back to the tower. He hadn't even bothered watching to see if his missile struck its mark.
