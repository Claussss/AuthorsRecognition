   The outcries were louder now, ranging from indignation to anger, punctuated by breaking glass and other such cacophonies. Years of hanging around with Tananda had trained my ear, so I amused myself by trying to catalogue the damage by its sound. That was a table going over,... Another chair,... A mirror (wonder how she missed the glasses?),... That was definitely a bone breaking,... Someone's head hitting the bar, the side, I think,... There go the glasses,... A body hurtled through the plate-glass window next to me and bounced once on the sidewalk before coming to a halt in a limp heap... a fairly good-sized one, too.
