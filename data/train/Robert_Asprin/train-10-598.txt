     A. VESPUCCI    Everyone made great noises about the map I had created. And Tanda gave me a long and very nice hug.   I didn't say much, since I was so proud of what I had done, I was afraid I'd ruin the moment by saying something stupid.    Finally, Aahz laid the map out on the table and said, "Let's      get to work. We need to find on here where the spell Count Bovine placed over this dimension is drawing its power."
