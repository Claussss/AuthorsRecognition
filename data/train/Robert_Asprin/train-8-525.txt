   "New bodyguard?" I sez, takin' a look behind me and ...    The world stops ... as does my heart and lungs.    Now, when I say this chick is stunnin', it has nothin' to do with the fact that she just knocked me cold. She has the smooth, strong lines of a panther ... except for a few pleasant roundin's one does not normally find on a cat of any size. She also has green scales and yellow eyes which are regardin' me levelly.
