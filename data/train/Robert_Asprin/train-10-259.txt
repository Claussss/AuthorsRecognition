   It took just over an hour in the mid-day heat to walk up the road to where we had first arrived in this dimension. I didn't meet anyone on the road, and the air was so hot and silent near the cliffs, it felt as if I was walking through my own tomb.    I shook myself off and tried not to let my thoughts go to the dark side of this.    I moved over to the rocks where we had hidden to watch      the two guys go by. My head was sweating under my hat so that when I reached the shade near the cliff I took it off.
