"This is something for your brother, Walegrin," Dubro decided with a firm nod of his head. "You tell him then. I'm going for a walk, maybe I'll find a garden somewhere. I don't want to go to the barracks." Dubro grunted and Illyra suppressed a sigh. A year ago, less even, and her husband would have gone into a rage at the mention of Walegrin's name. He had blamed all their misfortunes on her straw-haired brother. Now, since Walegrin had deposited Trevya in her arms, the commander was welcome in their house and the two men often spent the evening in a tavern. Dubro had even gone so far as to share the cost of posting the child to citizenship in the increasingly meaningless Rankan Empire.
