Not for the first time I noted Ssah's tendency for unnecessarily reckless action. However, this was not the time to go into it at length. "Team confirm. and home on Ssah's beacon." "Mahz confirms." "Ahk confirms." "Zur confirms." I waited for a few moments. Kor did not confirm. "Zur, Mahz, you are closest to Kor's sextant. Relay message or confirmation." "I have her confirmation, Commander," came Mahz's reply.
