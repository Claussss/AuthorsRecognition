   The floodlights went out suddenly, leaving me even more blinded than when they had been on.    "All right. Mister Skeeve. We'll try it your way. If you'll be so good as to follow me down to one of our â€˜interview' rooms?"    Even "trying it my way" was more hassle than I expected or liked. True, I was out from in front of the floodlights, but there were enough people crowded into the small "interview room" to make me feel like I was still on exhibition.
