He returned a moment later. "Cleya. It was the medallion." "Where did you get it?" Cholly told his story again. Ahdio stroked his chin glaring from his friend, to the medallion then at the door to the taproom. "You got trouble here," he said, returning the medallion. "Bad cess. Look, I have this old war buddy named Strick. He's a magician. Hold on, he's not like the ones you've seen. He's strictly a white mage ... literally can't use his powers for evil. Take my word, he's one of the good guys. Tell him I sent you."
