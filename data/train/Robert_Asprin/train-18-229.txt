me, Stilcho-ex-slave  speaks to  slave now-do  you enjoy  this condition? You'll trek to hell and  back to preserve that  little thread of life  of yours; you'll whimper and you'll go like a beaten  dog because even death won't make you  safe from her,   and your  life  won't  last a   moment if  she  forgets you the  way she's forgetting those others.  But what if there  were another source of  life?
