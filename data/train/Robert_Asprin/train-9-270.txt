That last was said by a burly Pervect, one of six actually who were blocking our path down the alley. Apparently our little act hadn't fooled everybody.    "Skeeve, I..."    "Never mind, Kalvin. I just figured out for myself what ‘Oops' means."    "Of course, you know this here's what you'd call a toll alley. You got to pay to use it."
