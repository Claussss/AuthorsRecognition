   As Aahz helped Glenda up the stone ladder, Tanda and I      went on up to the trap door. Since Aahz hadn't taught me a      spell yet that could sense if something was on the other side      of a wall, or a floor in this case, I was leaving that up to Tanda.    "We still in the clear?"  I asked.    "We are," Tanda said.    I eased up to the wooden trapdoor and pushed slowly. The wood scraped as it went up, then the door seemed to catch on something.  It took me a moment to realize it was a rug. From the looks of it, a very old rug.
