   "It looks like Manhattan... only more so!" That came from Massha. She's supposed to be my apprentice... though you'd never know it. Not only is she older than me, she's toured the dimensions more than I have.  Even though I've never claimed to be a know-it-all, it irritates me when my apprentice knows more than I do.    "I see what you mean," I said, bluffing a little. "At least, as much as we can see from here." It seemed like a safe statement. We were currently standing in an alley which severely limited our view. Basically, it was something to say without really saying anything.
