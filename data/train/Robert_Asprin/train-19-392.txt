They had reached the fourth sphere when the sound of feminine laughter from the kitchen broke Darios's concentration. "I doubt I'll remember even what we've done so far-" said Lalo, taking pity on him.

Darios can't hear the difference, he realized. Maybe I do know a few useful things after all. He opened the door.
