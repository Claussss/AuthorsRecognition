   "I don't see anybody," Tiffany said nervously, peering into the almost impenetrable shadows that lined the access.    "Maybe he woke up and moved on," Doc said. "We'll just check a little further, then-uh-oh."    "What is it, Doc?"    "Just keep walking, Tiffany. Don't look back."    Too startled to think clearly, the actress immediately shot a look behind them toward the mouth of the alley.    There were three men, faceless in the gloom but unmistakably heavyset, following the mock Legionnaires. When they saw Tiffany had spotted them, they quickened their pace as if to close the gap separating them from the pair.
