   "I... I'll try," I said "but it's not easy."    "Of course it's not easy!" the Djin shot back. "Who ever said it was easy? Nothing's easy. Sometimes it's less difficult than at other times, but it's never easy. Part of your problem is that you keep thinking things should be easy, so you assume the easy way is the right way. Case in point:    You knew it would be hard to ask me to stay on after I had fulfilled the contract, so you decided the right thing to do was not to ask... ignoring how hard it would be for you to keep hunting for Aahz without me."
