   For a change, I have no difficulty lookin' innocent and dumb, as he has totally lost me with his train of thought.    "What I have here are the papers promoting you to sergeant and Nunzio ... he's your cousin, isn't he? ... to corporal."    Now I am really lost.    "Promotions, sir?"    "That's right. Sergeant Smiley here has told me how the two of you have taken it on yourselves to lead your squad during training ... even to the point of giving them extra training during off duty hours. After seeing for myself how you took command after ... that mishap during training today, I have no problem approving your promotion. That's the kind of leadership and incentive we like to see here in the army. Congratulations."
