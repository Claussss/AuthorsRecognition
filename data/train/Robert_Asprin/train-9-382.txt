Pookie nodded and began scanning the immediate area with a watchful eye as I turned to J.R.    "Interesting friends you've got," he said, staring at my bodyguard.    "Funny, she was just saying the same thing about you.  She's my new bodyguard. After last night, it seemed like a good idea. Incidentally, sorry about that welcome. I forgot to warn her you were coming over."
