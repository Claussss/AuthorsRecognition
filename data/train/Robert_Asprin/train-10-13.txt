   "A scam, I'm sure," Aahz said, turning away. "Just like      you to waste money."    I frowned. This was going to be harder than I thought.      Normally, if there was any chance of making money at any     thing, he jumped at it.    Then it dawned on me I hadn't told him what the map led to.    "Aahz," I said to his back.    He didn't move. Instead he just kept staring out the win     dow at the courtyard.
