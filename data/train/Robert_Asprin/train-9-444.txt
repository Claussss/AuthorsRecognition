   "Actually, Captain, I'm a little surprised that I'm here.  I thought we had covered everything pretty well my last visit."    The police who had picked me up in front of my hotel and delivered me to the station had been extremely tight lipped. Beyond the simple statement that' â€˜The captain wants to see you," they hadn't given the slightest indication of why I was being pulled in.    "Oh, the IDs were just to confirm we were dealing with the right person," the captain smiled. "A point you have very generously conceded. As to why you're here, it seems there are one or two minor things we didn't cover the last time we chatted."
