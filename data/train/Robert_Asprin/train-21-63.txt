"It seems that the current financial crisis hasn't caused many cutbacks in your operation," Aahz said dryly. "Of course not" Grimble replied easily. "That's only to be expected." "How's that?"

You see, when a kingdom or company is doing well, no one wants to be bothered with budgets, much less cost savings. As long as there's money in the coffers, they're happy. On the other hand, when the operation is on the skids, such as is currently the case with Possiltum, then everyone wants answers ... or miracles ... and it's up to us irritating beancounters to provide them. More analysis means more man-hours, which in turn means a larger staff and expanded facilities."
