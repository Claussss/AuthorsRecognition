"Who else is working on it?" "Higgins on the East Coast and Marcus in New Orleans." "Higgins? I thought he got dumped after his last fiasco." "Just shelved. If you want my guess, someone's using this assignment as an excuse to dump him. I'd be willing to bet that whatever he turns in, it gets rejected. I'm guessing he'll be out by the end of the year." "It's about time. Who's Marcus?" "Never met him. He's supposed to be some kind of genius, but the word is he rubs a lot of people the wrong way. If he thinks you're an ass, he'll say so. You can imagine how well that goes over in the brainstorming sessions."
