"Drop him in acid. How do you..."    "I get the picture. That's it? You tell bad jokes?"    "Well, I give pretty good advice."    "That's good. I think I'm going to need some."    "I'll say. Well, the first piece of advice I've got for you is to forget about this and head for home before it's too late." For a moment the thought was almost tempting, but I shook it off.
