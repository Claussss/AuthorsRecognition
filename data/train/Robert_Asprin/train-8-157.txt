   "I was just wonderin'," I sez with a shrug. "It's nice to know you know I'd be under orders. The question is whether or not that officer knows it."    Now the sergeant is no dummy and I really don't expect him to fall for the old "there's someone behind you" gag ... but he does. It isn't until much later that I find out non-coms have a real thing about officers. That is, they are comfortable runnin' the army ... unless there is an officer somewhere in witnessin' range. Anyway, Smiley starts cranin' his neck around tryin' to spot the officer to which I am referrin', and when his head is turned away from me, I glide in on him.
