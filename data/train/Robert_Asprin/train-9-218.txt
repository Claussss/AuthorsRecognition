Well, if you must know, I'm a little uncomfortable around magicians... current company excepted, of course. Never had much call to deal with ‘em and just as happy to keep it that way. I've got a buddy, though, who's a financier. He just might be able to help you out.  Most of these finance types know each other, you know.  Leastwise, I can probably get you in to see him without an appointment."
