   "But-" I began.    "You will wait here," Aahz ordered. "I repeat, wait. No fights, no window shopping for dragons, just wait!"    "I'll stay here with him, Aahz," Tanda volunteered.    "Good," Aahz nodded. "And try to keep him out of trouble, okay?"    With that, he turned and disappeared into the crowd. Actually, I wasn't too disappointed. I mean, I would have liked to have gone with him, but I liked having some time alone with Tanda even more... that is, if you can consider standing in the middle of the Bazaar at Deva being alone with someone.
