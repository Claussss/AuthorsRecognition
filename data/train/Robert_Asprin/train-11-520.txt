   "The score," the troll continued casually, "is nothing to nothing to one ... against us. Not the best of starts, what?"    For one instant I thought we had scored. Then I remembered that in this game, points are scored against a team. Therefore "nothing to nothing to one" meant we were behind by a point.    "Don't worry," Aahz snarled. "We'll get the point back, with interest! If they want to play rough, so can we. Right?"
