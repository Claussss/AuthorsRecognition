   There was only one problem with it, and that was the   Robert Asprin   focus of our attention as we dashed in.   The only decoration that we had kept from the previ-    ous owners was an ornate tapestry hanging on the north    wall. Usually I'm faster than Aahz, but this time he beat    me to the hanging, sweeping it aside with his arm to re-    veal a heavy door behind it.    Our worst fears were realized.
