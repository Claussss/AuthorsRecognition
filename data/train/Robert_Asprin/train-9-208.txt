   "No. I meant why do you do this for money instead of getting a job?"    He studied me for a moment with his Pervish yellow eyes, then gave a small shrug.    "All right," he said. "I'll give you a straight answer.  You don't get rich working for someone else... especially not at the kind of jobs I'd been qualified for. You see, I don't come from money. All my folks gave me was my name. After that I was pretty much on my own. I don't have much school to my credit, and, like I say, my family isn't connected. I can't get a good job from an old pal of my dad's. That means I'd start at the bottom... and probably end there, too. Anyway, I gave it a good long think, and decided I wanted more out of life."
