   "Can I help you, lady?"    The proprietor was perched behind the counter on a stool readin' a newspaper. He didn't get up when he talked ta me, so I decided ta shake him up a little.    "Well, yes. I was thinkin' a buyin' a lot of ... stuff. Can you give me some better prices if I buy in volume?"    That brought him out from behind the counter with a pad and pencil which had materialized out of thin air.
