   "Why, sure, lady. Always ready to deal. What was it you were thinking of?"    I took my time and looked around the place again.    "Actually, I was wonderin' if you could quote me a price on everything in the store."    "Everything? Did you say everything?"    "Everything.. including your sweet adorable self."    "I don't understand, lady. Are you saying you want to buy my store?"    "Not the store, just what's in it. I'm thinkin' this place could do better in a new location. Truthfully now, how has business been going for you lately?"
