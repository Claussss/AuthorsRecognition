   "Umm ... Hi, Aahz," I said hesitantly.    "Hello, Skeeve," he replied without looking around.    I waited for a few moments for him to say something else. He didn't. Finally I sat down on the bench next to him and stared at the water myself a bit.    We sat that way for a while, neither of us saying anything. The trickling water began to have a tranquilizing, hypnotic effect on me, and I found my mind starting to relax and drift.
