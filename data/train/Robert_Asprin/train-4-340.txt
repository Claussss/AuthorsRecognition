  "Say, Skeeve. Where do you keep your dragon during the day?"   I glanced over to find Shai-ster studying my pet through narrowed, thoughtful eyes.   "Usually he's with me, but sometimes I leave him with a dragon-sitter. Why?"   "I just remembered an 'interruption of business' claim we had to pay the other day ....ad to pay! Heck, we're" still paying it. Anyway, this guy sells dragons, see, except for over a week now he hasn't sold a one. Usually sells about three a day and says since he paid us to be sure nothing happens to his business, we should make up the difference in his sales drop... and, you know, those things are expensive'."
