   "My name is Sergeant Smiley, and Ah will be your drill instructor for the next few days. Now, right away Ah want you to know that there are three ways of doing things in this man's army: the Right Way, the Army way, and My Way ... we will do things My way! Do I make myself clear?"    "YES, SERGEANT!!"    The group is gettin' into the swing of things now, bellowin' out their responses like a convention of beat cops goin' after a jaywalker.
