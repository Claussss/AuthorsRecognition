   A man with a white hat and a big shovel was slowly pick­     ing up fresh horse leavings and tossing them onto the piles. I      wanted to ask him what debt he was trying to pay off, or what      he was trying to buy, because whatever it was, the price was      too high.    When we reached the main area of town we stepped up on the sidewalk on the left side and into the shade. Sud­denly I realized just how hot our walk from the cliff had been, and how lucky it was these people wore hats. The sun hadn't seemed that hot at first, after coming from Vor­tex #6, but now that we were in the shade, I realized how bad it was.
