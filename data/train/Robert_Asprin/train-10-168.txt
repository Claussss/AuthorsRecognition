   "Exactly," Glenda said. "Except for going through these      Vortex locations at one point or another, the map changes the      correct path with every user, and every attempt."    "Hmmm." Aahz said, staring at the piece of parchment.      "Too bad we can't just take the magik out of the map and have it tell us the only true path to the dimension with the golden cow."    That gave me an idea. It was so simple it was probably stupid, so I didn't say anything aloud. Still, the thought kept rattling around in my head as the others continued their conversation.
