Dragons have various degrees of flame at their disposal, ranging from "toast a marshmallow" to "make a hole in rock." You might keep that in mind the next time you consider arguing with a dragon.    Within seconds of my extinguishing the pyrotechnics, a brief shower of black powder drifted down on us.
