   I considered doing something. I considered going back to sleep. Then I remembered my mentor's condition when he had gone to bed the night before.    That woke me up fast. The only thing nastier than a demon from Perv is a demon from Perv with a hangover.    I was on my feet and headed for the door in a flash. (My agility was a tribute more to my fear rather than to any inborn talent.) Wrenching the door open, I thrust my head outside and surveyed the terrain. The grounds outside the inn seemed normal. The weeds were totally out of hand, more than chest high in places. Something would have to be done about them someday, but my mentor didn't seem to mind their riotous growth, and since I was the logical candidate to cut them if I raised the point, I decided once again to keep silent on the subject.
