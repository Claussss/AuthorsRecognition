   Tanda laughed. "Master Magician Skeeve here just solved      a whole bunch of our problems."    I stared at the map, not believing what I was seeing.    Now there was only one line from Vortex #6 to Molder,      then a line from Molder to Vortex #5, then a line to a dimen     sion called Baasss, then a line back to here, Vortex #6, then      one final line to our cow dimension.    And the cow dimension now had a name.
