"Well, you've got a job here as long as I've got anything to say about it." I assured him.    "Thanks, Boss. I was startin' to get a little tired of how the Mob operates, know what I mean?" That rang a bell in my mind.    "Speaking of that, Nunzio, do you think the Mob would ever get involved with something like this character assassination thing?"
