   "Is that your lizard?" I asked.    "There he is!" Gus crowed triumphantly, snatching the reptile from his shoulder and cupping it in his hands. "Meet Berfert. He's the partner I was telling you about."    "Hello, Berfert," I smiled, extending a finger to stroke him.    The gargoyle reacted violently, jerking the lizard back out of my reach.    "Careful, there," he warned. "That's a good way to lose a finger."
