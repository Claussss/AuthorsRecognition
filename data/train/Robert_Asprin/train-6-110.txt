   There was a strangled sound behind me, from the general, I think. I ignored it.    "Therefore, all that is required is that I satisfy His Majesty... and his advisors... that my humble skills will indeed suffice his needs."    I turned to the throne once more, letting the king see my secret smile which belied the humility of my words.    "Your Majesty, my powers are many and varied. However, the essence of power is control. Therefore realizing you are a busy man, rather than waste time with mere commercial trickeries and minor demonstrations such as we have already seen, I shall weave but three spells and trust in your wisdom to perceive the depths behind them."
