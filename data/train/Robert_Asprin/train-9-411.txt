   I fought against a wave of disappointment, unwilling to believe that after everything I had been through, this was going to turn out to be another dead end.  "Didn't he have a school or business or something? I met one of his apprentices once."    The Pervect shook his head.    "No. That we would have known about. He may have been willing to instruct a few close friends or relatives...  that's not uncommon for someone who's studied here. But I think I can say for sure that he hasn't been doing any formal teaching here or on any other dimension. We would have heard, if for no other reason than his students would have contacted us to confirm his credentials." Now that he mentioned it, I did recall that Rupert, the apprentice I had met, had specifically been introduced as Aahz's nephew. Overcome with a feeling of hopelessness, I almost missed what the record keeper said next.  "Speaking of relatives. We do have an address for his next of kin... in this case, his mother. Perhaps if you spoke to her, you might find out his current whereabouts."
