   I picked up the box and toyed with it idly.    "I thought I had stopped her by giving Rodrick wedding rings that they thought linked their lives, rings that wouldn't come off. The one in the box here is hers... of course, she had to cut off her finger to get rid of it. I hadn't anticipated that."    "I rather suspect she wanted her dream more than her finger," Chumley said with a grimace.    "So it would seem," I nodded. "Now she's on the loose, with an army we inadvertently supplied her with back when I was Court Magician of Possiltum. I'm not the greatest military appraiser around, but I don't think there's anything on Klah that can stop her ... unless M.Y.T.H. Inc. takes a hand in the game."
