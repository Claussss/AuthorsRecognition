I've overextended my credit trying to keep up a good front, and now it's catching up with me."    "Gee, Quigley, if that's your only problem we can take care of it in no time at all. We can arrange a quick consolidation loan to get the wolves off your back... with a slight interest charge, of course. Right, Aahz?"
