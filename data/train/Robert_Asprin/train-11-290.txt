   "So far, so good," Aahz murmured, scanning the backs in front of us to be sure we were unobserved.    "Maybe we should quit while we're ahead," I suggested hopefully.    "Shut up and start working," he snapped back in a tone that left no room for argument.    With an inward sigh, I closed my eyes and began making subtle changes in our disguises.    When I first learned the disguise spell, it was specifically to alter the facial features and body configurations of a being to resemble another. Later, after considerable practice, I learned to change the outward appearance of inanimate objects, providing they had once been alive. Aahz had seized this modification for a new application... specifically to change the configuration of our clothes. By the time I was done, we not only looked like Jahks, we were dressed in the uniforms of Veygan soldiers.
