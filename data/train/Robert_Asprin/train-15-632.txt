   The Reverend Jordan Ayres was not, on the whole, a man who placed great value on subtlety. He had found his answers to the problems of life, and they were big answers, flamboyant, in-your-face answers.

For the most part, they did work, if only because the way people usually solved their problems was to do something, almost anything, besides sitting and brooding on them.
