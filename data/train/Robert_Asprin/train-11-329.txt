Maybe then we can forget the whole thing-if you'll let us."    Aahz was standing motionless with his back to me. Now that I had vented my anger, I found myself suddenly regretful for having ground it in so mercilessly.    "Aahz?" I asked, stepping in behind him. "Hey! C'mon, we've got to give it back and get Tanda."
