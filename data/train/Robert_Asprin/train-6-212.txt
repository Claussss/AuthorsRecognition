   "She's been waiting for us, Aahz," I supplied brightly.    "That's right!" Aahz scowled. "Grimble said you set us up for this job."    Tanda winced.    "I can explain that," she said apologetically.    "I can hardly wait," Aahz intoned.    "I'm kind of curious about that myself," I added.    "Um... this could take a while, guys," she said thoughtfully. "Got anything around to drink?"    That was easily the most reasonable question asked so far today. We broke out the wine, and in no time were sitting around in a small circle quenching our thirst. Much to Aahz's disgust, I insisted we sit close enough to Gleep that he not be left out. This meant, of course, his rather aromatic breath flavored our discussion, but as I pointed out it was the only way to keep him quiet while we talked.
