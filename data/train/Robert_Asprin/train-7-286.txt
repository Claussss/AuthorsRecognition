"It's us, Quigley," the Kid said briskly before I could even say "Hi." "Will you let us in, or should we just go home?"    "Skeeve? Oh, thank goodness. Certainly... come right in."    I personally thought Skeeve was being a bit abrupt, and Quigley's fawning over him wasn't going to improve his manners at all.
