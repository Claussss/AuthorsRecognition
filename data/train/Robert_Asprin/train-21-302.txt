A part of me bristled at the thought of having to ease up on my drinking, but I fought it down ... along with my flash of fear at what that bristling might imply. "Okay, Nunzio," I said. "I'll do it. Thanks again. I appreciate how hard that was for you." "Don't mention it, Boss. Glad I could help you." He reached out and laid a hand on my shoulder in a rare display of comradeship. "Personally, I don't think you have that much to worry about. If you've got a drinkin' problem, it's marginal at best. I mean, it's not like you've been blackin' out or anything."
