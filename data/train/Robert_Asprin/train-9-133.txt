   It was nice to know some Pervects were efficient, once you had met their price. The hundred in gold had already disappeared.    The desk clerk slipped the receipt across the desk, a key held daintily in his other hand. I claimed the receipt and was starting to go for the key when he casually moved it back out of my reach, slapping his palm down on a small bell that was on the desk.    "Front!"    Before I could ask what this little declaration was supposed to mean, a bellhop had materialized at my side...  a different one than before.
