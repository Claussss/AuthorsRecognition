One day, this cartographer showed up. I wanted him to help me escape and he said he couldn't."    "He can't," Tanda said.    "Why?" I asked.    "He told me that, as long as he didn't involve himself in any activity in any dimension," Harold said, "he was free to use his magik to move anywhere he wanted, map anything he wanted, including through the magik that Count Bovine had put up to hold me here in this castle."
