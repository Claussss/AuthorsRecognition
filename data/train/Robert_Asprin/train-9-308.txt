   I could see I was playing into a stacked deck, so I abandoned the idea of impressing him with my innocence.  "I guess the bottom line is the same as before that sheet came in, then. Are you going to press charges against me... or am I free to go?"    He studied me for a few more moments, then waved his hand.    "Go on. Get out of here... and take your little street buddy with you. Just take my advice and don't carry so much cash in the future. There's no profit in teasing the animals."
