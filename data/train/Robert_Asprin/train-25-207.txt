"Jesus Christ, Steve. Have you ever used that placekick stunt before? In combat?" "Three times before. This is the second time it worked." "I saw it but I still don't believe it. If I ever mouth off about your knives again, you can use one of them on me." "Yeah, right. Say, can you be sure someone takes care of Aki's arm? I just want to go off and get drunk right now." "Sure thing, Steve. Oh, someone wants to talk to you."
