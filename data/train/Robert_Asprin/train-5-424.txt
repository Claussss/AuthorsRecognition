   The Kid was eyeing me thoughtfully. "I don't suppose you'd go thirty on that?" he said.    "I'll not only go it, I'll raise you thirty."    There were muffled exclamations of disbelief in the room... and some not so muffled. I recognized the voices of some of the latter.    The Kid just shook his head and pushed the appropriate number of chips into the pot without a word.    The crowd lapsed into silence and craned their necks to see the next cards.
