   This was one of the first times Aahz had actually clarified something he said. I wished he hadn't. I was more confused than I had been before.    "Um... how are we going to do all this?" I asked.    "We'll be able to tell better after you've had your first war council," Aahz shrugged.    "Aren't we having it now?"    "I meant with the enemy," Aahz scowled. "Sometime in the near future, you're going to have to sit down with one of their officers and decide how this war's going to be fought."
