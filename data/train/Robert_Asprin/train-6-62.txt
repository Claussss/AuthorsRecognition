   This was the first real proof I'd had as to how far my magical powers had developed in the past year. I knew this candle from my years as Garkin's apprentice. In those days, it was my arch nemesis. Even focusing all my energies failed to light it then. But now...    I glanced at the wick again, and again it rewarded me with a burst of flame.    I snuffed it and repeated the exercise, my confidence growing as I realized how easily I could now do something I once thought impossible.
