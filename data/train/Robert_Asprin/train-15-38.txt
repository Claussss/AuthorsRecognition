   After a few moments, Brandy held up her hands and shouted, "Hold on! Freefall, you aren't supposed to count."    Freefall pouted. "But Sarge, I wanna count. I like counting. "    Brandy growled, "It doesn't matter; you're a squad leader. You don't have to count."    "I don't see why Freefall can't count," said another voice from the back of the group. "Counting is fun."    "If Freefall counts, it throws the count off," said Brandy, glaring at the recruit who'd interrupted. "Now, everybody count off by threes-except for Freefall."
