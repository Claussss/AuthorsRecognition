   "Hold the elevator!"    The bellman caught the door with his hand in response to the call, and a broad-shouldered, chisel-featured young man in a black uniform burst into the car.    "Sorry for the inconvenience," he announced in an offhand tone that didn't sound apologetic at all, "but I have to commandeer the elevator for a moment."    As he spoke, he used a key to override the control panel and punched a button. The door closed, and the car began to move-downward instead of up.
