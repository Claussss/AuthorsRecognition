   "No. He offered to back half my bid so I could stay in the running... only it wasn't a painting. It was more what you would call literary."    Now I was getting confused.    "Literary? But I thought you said it was an art auction."    "It was, but there was an author there who offered to auction off an appearance in his next book. Well, I knew the author... I had done an interview with him in one of the â€˜zines I publish... so I thought it would be kind of neat to see how he would do me in print. Anyway, it came down to two of us, and the bidding got pretty stiff. I thought I was going to have to drop out."
