"I know it's raining," Aahz retorted tersely. "C'mon. Let's step in here while I get my bearings."    "Here," in this case, was some sort of invisible bubble enveloping one stall which seemed to be doing an admirable job of keeping the rain out. I've used magik wards before to keep out unwelcome intruders, but it had never occurred to me to use it against the elements.
