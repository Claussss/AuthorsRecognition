   I shrugged carelessly.    "It's not that hard to understand. He's a Pervect, so it's only natural that when things go wrong, he'd head for..."    "A Pervect?"    Kalvin was looking at me as if I'd just grown another head.  "You have one of these goons for a friend? And you admit it? And when he leaves you try to get him back?"    Now, I couldn't speak for any of the other citizens of Perv, but I knew Aahz was no goon. That's fact, not idle speculation. I knew the difference because I had two goons, Guido and Nunzio, working for me. I was about to point this out when it occurred to me that I wasn't required to give Kalvin any kind of explanation. I was the owner, and he was my servant.
