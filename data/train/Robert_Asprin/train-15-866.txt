   "Tgfrblt..."    "I don't know about you, but I'm going to go attack the free lunch buffet over by the dollar slots. It's the best deal in the casino!"    "Captain, can you confirm or deny the rumor?"    "Tgfrblt!"    "I'm calling Security right now, do you hear me?"    "Who you calling Security?"    "Come on, let's go see the action at the roulette tables!"    "Will everybody please shut up for one freaking minute?" The voice booming through the loudspeaker behind the comm console made everyone in the room jump and turn to look. There was Mother, standing at the console with a mike in her hand, glaring at the room. Suddenly realizing that six pairs of eyes and one Galaxy-wide network holocam were pointing at her, she gave a little shriek and ducked back behind the console almost as if someone had grabbed the collar of her jumpsuit and yanked her down.
