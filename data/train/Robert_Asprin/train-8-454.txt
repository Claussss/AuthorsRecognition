   "Yeah ... well ... I guess that's settled," the guy sez, lookin' back and forth between Nunzio and the men. "We'll go ahead and get started."    As he is goin', I find I cannot resist takin' one last dig at him.    "Say, Nunzio," I sez in a loud voice. "What do you call a teamster in a three piece suit?"    "The defendant!" Nunzio shoots back just as loud.    This humor goes right past the others in the crew, but the driver gets it. He breaks stride, and for a second I think he's gonna come back to "discuss" it with us at length. Instead, he just keeps on goin' and contents himself with slammin' the door for his witty response.
