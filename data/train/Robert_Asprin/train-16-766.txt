   "Captain need help. This will help!" Tusk-anini growled, not releasing his grip on the weapon.    "Give it to him," C.H. said, turning back to the supply clerk.    "But Sarge ..."    "Give it to him. I'll check him out on it myself."    With a shrug, the clerk released the weapon and watched as Tusk-anini walked away, cradling the bit of nastiness protectively in his arms.    "You tell me, hoss," the sergeant said softly. "Can you think of anyone in this outfit who could hold down that weapon better'n Tusk? It's got a kick like a sonofabitch."
