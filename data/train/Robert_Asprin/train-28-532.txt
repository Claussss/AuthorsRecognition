Carrying a pretty pendant off a woman's earring, Hakiem hied him to the  palace. Gained the  Presence by  sending in  one word  to the  Prince, with the pendant. Assured him he had nothing to do with the theft. Most privily Hakiem stated what he'd been told, and the thief's terms. Ransom. The Prince-Governor had to pay, and knew it. If he could get the damned  Savankh back, he'd never  have to let  out that it  had been stolen  in the first place.
