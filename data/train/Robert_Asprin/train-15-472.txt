And if he sees things my way, I suspect you'll have something to answer for, as well."    "Mr. Snipe, I'll take my chances," said Armstrong. "Would you like to finish inspecting the base before you report to the major?"    "Very well," snapped the other lieutenant. He stomped out the door, and a keen nose would have detected smoke coming from his ears.
