   There's a ripple of noise spreadin' forward from the back of the crowd, buildin' in volume as more and more voices join in. Abandonin' my efforts to see what's goin' on, I bend an ear to try to sort out what it is they're sayin'.    "... magician ..."    "He's back!"    "HE'S COMING!"    "... COURT MAGICIAN!!!"    "LOOK!! THERE HE IS!! IT'S ..."    "THE GREAT SKEEVEH!"    ... And it was!!    Just as I make out the words, the crowd at the back of the throne room parts, and the Boss comes walkin' in ... and Aahz is with him!! They seem to be arguin', of course, and are totally ignorin' the crowd around them which first surges back, then presses forward like a wall.
