  You may wonder how I went from talking with Massha to sitting on the throne. Well, I wonder myself from time to time, but here's what happened as near as I can reconstruct it.   Needless to say, her request to work as my apprentice caught me unprepared.   "M ... my ... but Massha. You already have a job as a court magician. Why would you want to apprentice yourself to me?"   In response, Massha heaved a great sigh. It was a startling phenomenon to watch. Not just because there was so much of Massha moving in so many different directions, but because when she was done, she seemed to have deflated to nearly half her original size. She was no longer an imposing figure, just a rather tired looking fat woman.
