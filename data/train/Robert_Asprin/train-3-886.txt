journeymen up at  the Mageguild, but  this summer (a  summer that was  really no worse than any  other) the  big magic-banded  doors stayed  shut and  the Hazard mages, when they were  seen at all, were  sweating through their robes  like any common laborer. Rumor said the worst was over and the magic was coming back, though only to  the strongest, or the  cursed, and as  yet too unpredictable  to sell at  any price.
