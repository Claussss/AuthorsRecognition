"I thought it was their idea to use Brazil for the fighting." "It was, but we got it in writing first. That puts it in our pocket as far as history or the press is concerned. We've got 'em cold."

You know Uncle Sammy-anything he can't tax he doesn't like, and anything he doesn't like he meddles with. It's within possibilities that he'll try to make us compromise with the Combine and divvy up the mines. If that happens, there will be a brawl, both in the courts and in Congress. If we're going to win that fight, we've got to have public support solidly behind us. That's where the saturation campaign comes in.

Hell, Eddie, you were the one who pointed it out in the first place."
