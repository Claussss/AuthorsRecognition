"Are they wearing kill-suits?" came a third voice from farther down the street. "As a matter of fact, they aren't!" shouted another voice from the alley alongside the cafe. "That was live ammo?" "I believe it was." The men by the truck were milling about, craning their necks at the unseen voices. Worthington suddenly realized he was sweating. "You hear that, boys? Live ammo!" "Fine by us!" The lieutenant opened his mouth to shout something, anything, but it was too late. His voice was drowned out by the first ragged barrage. He had time to register with horror that it was not even a solid hail of bullets that swept their convoy. It was a vicious barrage of snipers, masked marksmen. One bullet, one soldier. Then a grenade went off under the truck next to him and he stopped registering things.
