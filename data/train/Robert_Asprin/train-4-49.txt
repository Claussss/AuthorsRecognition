  With light heart and heavy purse, I entered my quarters.   Remember the last time I entered my quarters? How there was a demon waiting for me? Well, it happened again.   Now don't get me wrong. This isn't a regular occurrence in my day-to-day existence. One demon showing up unannounced is a rarity. Two demons... well, no matter how you looked at it, this was going to be a red-letter day in my diary.
