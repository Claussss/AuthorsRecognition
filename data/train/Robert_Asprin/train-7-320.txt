   I hadn't realized he had moved from my side until I saw him vault the low railing that separated the spectators from access to the playing field. The move was a bit spry for the "old man" guise he was using, but no one else seemed to notice.    It was a real pleasure to watch the Kid work... especially considering the fact that I taught him most of what he knows. I had to admit he had gotten pretty good over the years.
