  It suddenly occurred to me that I hadn't thought about my old mentor for days. The crises that had erupted shortly after his departure had occupied my mind to an extent where there was no time or energy left for brooding. Except for the occasional explanation of his absence, Aahz was playing no part in my life currently. I was successfully handling things without him.   Okay. I had successfully handled some things without him ... the Mob, for example. Of course, the training he had gotten me into earlier in our relationship had also provided me with confidence under fire... another much-needed commodity these days.
