Egor paused for a moment, but no laughter greeted his attempted joke. "Actually," he continued, "they've been working on their own on a surprise they've cooked up for today's meeting. I don't know what it is, but they've been planning it ever since they found out the yearly meeting was going to be on the Scorpion-and if I know my crew, it should be memorable." He sat down, and Tambu waited until the polite applause died.
