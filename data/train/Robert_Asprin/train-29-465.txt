"Where do I find him?" "You mean to tell me you lost him again?!" Markmor screamed, his face almost as livid as his robes. "I almost got him at Land's End. How was I to know the knife would bounce off his vest?" Marype cowered. "Then what happened?" "I followed him to the docks. It wasn't easy. He must know every twist and turn of every alley in town. He went into a place called the Winebarrel, and when he came out he was with two other men. One was a fishface, and the other had one arm. They got into a boat and rowed away. I had to be careful. People tend to notice when you appear and disappear in public. Besides, as long as he has the amulet not even you can trace him by magic."
