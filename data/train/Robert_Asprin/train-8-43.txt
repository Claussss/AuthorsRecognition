   "Ah can't hear you!"    "No, Sergeant!"    "Louder! Sound off like you got a pair!"    'NO, SERGEANT!!"    "That's better!"

By focusin' on one individual, not only has the sergeant let the rest of the group off the hook of tryin' to come up with an acceptable response to his questions, he has impressed on them that they really don't want to ever be singled out by him.
