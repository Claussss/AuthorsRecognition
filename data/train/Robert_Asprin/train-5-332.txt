   "But how am I supposed to stand a chance in this game? I'm not even going to be able to remember all the rules."    An awkward silence came over the table.    "I ... uhh... think you've missed the point, Skeeve," Tananda said at last. "You don't stand a chance. The Kid is the best there is. There's no way you can learn enough in a few days or a few years to even give him a run for his money. All we're trying to do is teach you enough so that you won't embarrass yourself-as in ruin the reputation of the Great Skeeve-while he whittles away at your stake. You've got to at least look like you know what you're doing.  Otherwise you come across as a fool who doesn't know enough to know how little he knows."
