            I tried to get my mind off the question. Maybe Aahz was right. No sense worrying about the problem until we knew for sure it existed. Maybe he wouldn't get his powers back. Maybe I'd get to be the one to fight Isstvan after all. Terrific.             "Hey! Watch the beast, kid!"             Aahz's voice broke my train of thought. We were leading the war unicorn between us, and the beast chose this moment to act up.
