   "Yeah!" Aahz answered. "So?"    "I've seen a pendant like that before!" I explained excitedly. "That's how he's controlling the dragon!"    The Deveel who had been running the Dragon stall where I acquired Gleep had worn a pendant like that. The pendant was used to control dragons... unattached dragons, that is. Attached dragons can be controlled by their owner without other assistance. A dragon becomes attached to you when you feed it. That's how I got Gleep. I fed him, sort of. Actually, he helped himself to a hefty bit of my sleeve.
