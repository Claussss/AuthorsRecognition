   "The golden cow?" I asked again, "Is it real?"    Aahz slowly turned and looked at me.    "A myth. There are a lot of them in the different dimen     sions."    "You're kidding! You mean there is more than one golden-milk-giving-cow myth?" Considering that I had never heard of a cow before today, I found that a little hard to imagine. I'm not sure exactly why I thought even one golden cow was easy to imagine, but dozens of them were just too much. Maybe there was an entire dimension with a race of them.
