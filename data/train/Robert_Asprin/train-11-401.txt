   "You know Tanda?" I asked.    "Oh, quite," Chumly smiled. "She's my little sister."    "Your sister?" I gaped.    "Rather. Didn't you notice the family resemblance?"    "Well... I, ah ... " I fumbled.    "Don't let him kid you," my mentor grinned. "Tanda and Chumly are from Trollia, where the men are Trolls and the women are Trollops. With men like this back home, you can understand why Tanda spends as much time as she does dimension hopping."
