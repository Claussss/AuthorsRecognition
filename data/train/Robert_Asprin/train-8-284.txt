   "Oh, right ... sorry."    I go back to starin' into my glass, doin' my best to ignore her presence ... which is not easy as the crowd is pressin' a considerable amount of her against me as we're standin' there.    "Okay, who's our pigeon?"    "You see the two broad-shouldered guys at our table? The loud ones? I figure the one on the left will do you just fine."    Guide and I have decided on Shu Flie for our victim. Of the crew, we're probably the least fond of the Flie brothers, and while either of them would probably serve our purposes, Shu is the more dominant and might start trouble if Tananda made a play for his brother instead of him. As our objective is to cause trouble between the army and the civilians, fightin' within our own ranks would be counter-productive.
