   "Sure will," I said, and headed out into the street.    The sun was still cooking the hard center of the street, so      I stayed on the sidewalk, tipping my hat and saying "Howdy"      to anyone who passed me. The guy with the shovel must have      finished cleaning up the street, leaving only the big piles of horse droppings as evidence of his work.    It hadn't been much longer than fifteen minutes since Glenda had left me, even though it felt like an eternity. There was no sign of her or Aahz or Tanda.
