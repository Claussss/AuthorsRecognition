If Tanda got herself in trouble acquiring it, that's bloody well her problem. You can't expect Aahz to feel responsible."    "Yes, I can," I corrected.    "No," the troll declared. "The only acceptable solution is to trounce these blighters soundly at their own game. I trust you'll allow me to fill a position on your team?"
