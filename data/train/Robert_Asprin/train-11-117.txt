   "You have a Plan B?" I asked, genuinely impressed.    "Sure," she grinned. "I just made it up. You can fly us both across the floor and over the wards. Then we latch onto the Trophy and fly back to Klah from inside the wards."    "I don't know," I frowned.    "Now what's wrong?" my guide scowled.    "Well, flying's a form of levitation," I explained. "I've never tried flying myself and someone else, and even if I can do it, we'll be pushing down on the floor as hard as if we were walking on it. It might set the alarm off."
