   "Don't worry about us, boss," Brockhurst waved.    I wasn't reassured.    I managed to make my way to the counter without banging my sword against anything or anyone, a feat that raised my spirits for the first time that afternoon. Thus bolstered, I approached the gargoyle.    "I... um ... I don't recall ordering anything," I stated politely.    "Don't blame you, either," the gargoyle growled through his smile. "Beats me how anyone or anything can eat the slop they serve here."
