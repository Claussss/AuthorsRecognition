"Your appearance does not concern me," Tambu said. "Nor do I find it unpleasant. I do, however, have several questions for you." "First, I have a question for you," the girl countered. "What do you intend to do with me and my crew?" "What is usually done with pirates caught in the very act of committing their crimes?" Tambu asked blandly. "Usually they are turned over to the authorities on the nearest inhabited planet where they are hanged or shot, with or without trial. Occasionally, they are put to death by the ship which captures them." Ramona's eyes met Tambu's squarely. "I might also add that if your plans for us follow those expected patterns, I see no reason why we should answer your questions or cooperate with you in any way."
