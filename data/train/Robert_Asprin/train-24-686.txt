"Space-shuttle Leader, Commander. We have encountered the Ant spacecraft and destroyed it." "Spacecraft was apparently unprepared for combat. By going into low orbit, we were able to intercept it before it had an opportunity to change course from launch pattern. Cold-beams were effective in completely destroying the craft." "Return to transports." "Acknowledged, Commander." It was reassuring to know some phase of this assault had been executed without difficulty.
