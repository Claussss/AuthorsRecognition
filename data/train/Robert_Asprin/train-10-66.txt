   The woman looked up at him and smiled. She had deep orange eyes and a pug nose that looked more like a hog's nose than anything like Tanda's. I had never seen a demon like her before.    "Yes?"  she asked.    I almost fell over backwards. Her voice was deep, rough, and clearly that of a man. It was with the voice that I actually      looked at her.  Or him, as I was coming to realize. I had no idea why I had thought he was a woman. His arms and shoulÂ­ders were built like a man's, and his brownish hair was cut short. Yet I had sworn, until he spoke, that he was a woman. Just thinking about it was getting me confused. Aahz got right to the point.
