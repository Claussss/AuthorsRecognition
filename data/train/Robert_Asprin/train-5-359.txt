   "MARKIE!! STOP!!"    "But Daddy..."    "Just hold it. Okay? Nunzio?"    "I've got him, Boss," he called, both hands wrapped securely around Gleep's snout as the dragon struggled to get free.    "Bunny? You and Markie get inside! Now!!!"    The two of them hurried from sight, and I turned my attention to my pet.    Gleep seemed to have calmed down as fast as he had exploded, now that Bunny and Markie were gone. Nunzio was stroking her neck soothingly while staring at me in wide-eyed amazement.
