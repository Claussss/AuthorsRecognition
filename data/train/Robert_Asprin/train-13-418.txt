   "Well, here we are," said Gears. He pointed toward a large woman sitting at a portable desk, shaded by an awning.    "You'll need to report to First Sergeant Brandy, I guess that's her over there. She'll tell you where to go and what to do."    "Thanks!" said Thumper, grabbing his duffel and jumping out of the hoverjeep.    "No problem, buddy," said the driver. "And good luck!" He started the jeep back up and he headed off. Thumper shouldered his duffel and began walking toward Brandy. He still had no idea what Omega Company had in store for him, but he was about to find out and this-time, he was determined not to throwaway his opportunities.
