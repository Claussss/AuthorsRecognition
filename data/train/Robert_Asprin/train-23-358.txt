"They'll also know I've quit the fleet," Whitey pointed out. "And why. I don't think I'll have much trouble." "It sounds like you've thought this through pretty carefully," Tambu observed bitterly. "I've given it some thought, ever since they gave me the news on Elei. Just for the record, Tambu, I think you're wrong. The fleet was never popular with the planets before, but now you're taking on the role of an extortionist. I don't think they'll put up with that for long. There's going to be trouble, and I for one don't want to be around when it hits."
