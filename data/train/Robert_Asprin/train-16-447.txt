"Don't go away mad," Laverna said with a sneer, and reached for her book once more.    "Not mad. Simply annoyed," the butler corrected. "More with myself than with you."    "How's that?"    "I pride myself in my judgment of people, Ms. Laverna," Beeker explained. "In fact, my effectiveness depends on it. I therefore find it annoying when it turns out I misjudged someone, particularly in a case of overestimation."
