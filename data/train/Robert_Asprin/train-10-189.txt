We might have to do some      traveling, and, from what I remember, horses are the only      means of travel here."    "Money?" Aahz asked. "We're going to need money as well."    "I don't think so," Glenda said. "This place doesn't use money."    I thought Aahz was going to have a heart attack. It was like telling him the sun would never come up again.
