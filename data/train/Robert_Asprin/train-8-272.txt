   Thinkin' it over real hard, I finally come up with an answer: What I gotta do is think of it as a joke on a buddy. Okay, maybe it's a dubious joke ... like poppin' a paper bag behind someone who's gettin' ready to blow a safe ... but as long as the notable in question does not end up permanently damaged or incarcerated as a result, it can be passed off as a joke.    Now, my only concern is tryin' to make sure that whoever we pick has a sense of humor ... a real good sense of humor!
