   Somethin' was tuggin' at the back of my mind ... somethin' that Nunzio had said about his last assignment and bein' nervous about workin' with Gleep again. I couldn't put my finger on it, though, and seein' as how the discussion was makin' Tananda uncomfortable, I decided not to pursue the subject. I did, however, make a mental note to talk with Nunzio about it when we had a chance.    "Sounds like things weren't goin' too well even before the accident," I sez, pickin' up on her last aside.
