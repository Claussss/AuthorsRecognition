   "It worked," Aahz said.  "Nice job, Skeeve."    It wasn't often that I got a compliment from my mentor, so I savored the moment. Tanda patted me on the arm and gave me a kiss on the cheek for a reward. Nothing like doing a job and doing it well.    I took her glass of carrot juice and sipped from it while we studied the map.    Only one road led from Biscuit where we were, through Bethel and then to Donner. Donner actually was the place with the golden cow. We had been closer than we thought.
