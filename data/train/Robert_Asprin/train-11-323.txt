I asked, logically.    "No special reason," he shrugged. "I just want to look at this Trophy that's caused everyone so much trouble."    "Didn't you see it back at Veygus?" I frowned.    "Not really," my mentor admitted. "At first I was busy chasing away the soldiers and the civilians, and after that it was something big and heavy to carry. I never really stopped to study it."
