   It occurs to me that this promotion thing is gettin' totally out of hand.    "Ummm ... We're pretty happy with things the way they are, Don Bruce." I sez, quick-like.    "Yeah," Nunzio chimes in. "We figure the way things are going, the Boss is gonna need all the help we can give him."    "Hmmm ... I suppose you're right," the Don sez, makin' us both a little uncomfortable with how unwillin' he seems to give up the idea of advancin' us in the ranks. "Tell you what, though, like Skeeve says, I can't take an open hand in this thing you got going, but if you want I can assign a few boys to give you a hand!"
