"Oh," Harold said.  "Of course.  Sunlight kills vampires."    "Of course," I said out loud, pretending I had just forgot     ten, even though I had never known that fact about vampires.      Why would I have? Until I came to this stupid dimension, I had never seen or even heard of a vampire. I just figured they had something to do with full moons.
