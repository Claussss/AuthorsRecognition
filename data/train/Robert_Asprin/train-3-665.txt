steal and eventually to kill  as a means of survival,  not as a sport. I  didn't like it, but it was necessary. Once  I won my freedom, I did everything  I could to rise above my beginnings... not far by noble standards, but as high as I have been able. I'm told I have a contempt for those below me who have not matched my efforts, let alone my success. That may  be so, but I have more regard  for them
