   "Do you have a criminal record?"    "Beg pardon?"    "A criminal record. Have you ever been arrested?"    "No convictions."    That earns me another hard look.    "I didn't ask about convictions. I asked if you've ever been arrested."    "Well... yeah. Hasn't everybody?"    "What for?"    "Which time?"    "How many times have you been arrested?"    "Oh, three... maybe four dozen times... but no convictions."
