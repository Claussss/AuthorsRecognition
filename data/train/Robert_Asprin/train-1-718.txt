"You're more the fool than I thought, Illyra the Seeress." "All right, I don't want to damn it to hell. I'd love to see a Sanctuary where flowers bloomed along the streets and honest people didn't have to hide after sundown. I'd love to see a Sanctuary where men loved their wives, wives loved their children, and children had a chance to grow up with food in their bellies. "Who wouldn't want Sanctuary like that? But Sanctuary's Sanctuary and it never changes."
