   "You have the other canister of juice?" I asked Aahz. "Afraid not, apprentice," he said.   "Left it back on Kowtow when we hopped out of there."    My first reaction was not to believe him. Then it became clear that he had left the rest of my carrot juice, and my reaction was anger.    "How could you do that?" I shouted. "Easy," he said.    He showed me by reaching into his pouch, taking out an invisible canister, and dropping it to the floor. "But what am I going to do without it?" Again I shouted. I needed that carrot juice; right down to the very bottom of my soul I needed it.
