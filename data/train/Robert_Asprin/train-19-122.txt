So it was Amoli who sent Tarkle after me. So Tarkle works for her? Or she and Tarkle both work for Marype-or she and that slimebag mage are partners or lovers or both. And the moment I visited his house I was brilliant enough to let her know! Damn! Stupid, Hanse, stupid! Two minutes after I left her that night she must've been hustling her hippy self along the tunnel to tell Marypel "What we ought to do," he muttered, "is shave some of that fat off the bitch and feed it to her!"
