He's as solid as they come, and the crew respects him." "Wait a minute," Tambu protested. "I haven't reached a decision on this mess yet. Don't-" "Yes, you have,' Whitey corrected gently. "You may not know it yet, but you have. I know you, Tambu. Maybe better than you know yourself. If you were going to jump the way I think you should, you would have done it by now. Just the fact that you're still seesawing back and forth tells me something. It tells me I can't follow you any more."
