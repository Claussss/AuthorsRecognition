   "He served me a roast Klahd on a platter!" I said, leveling a shaky but accusing finger at the Pervect.    "Is that a fact now?" The policeman cocked an eye at the Pervect, who became quite agitated.    ‘ ‘Non-sense! Eet is against the law to serve sentient beings without a license. See for yourself, Offisair! Thees is a replica onley."    Sure enough, he was right! The figure on the platter was actually constructed on pieces of unidentifiable cuts of meat with what looked like baked goods filling in the gaps. The rat seemed to be authentic, but I'll admit I didn't look close.  The overall effect was, as I can testify, horrifyingly real.  The policeman studied the dish closely before turning his attention to the waiter once more.
