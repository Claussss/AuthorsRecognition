Massha dropped a heavy hand on my shoulder.   "Hot stuff, remember our deal about my lessons?"   "Later, Massha. The match is about to start."   Actually, it was about to finish. It was that short, if you'll pardon the expression.   The first member of the favored red trunk team simply strolled out and pinned his white-trunked rival. Though the pin looked a bit like someone trying to wrap a package with tangled string, the red-trunker made it seem awfully easy. All efforts of his opponent's partner to dislodge the victor were in vain, and the bout was over.
