   The man sighed.    "Look," he said, "this land has two potential capitals. One is Veygus, and this one, as you know, is Ta-hoe."    I hadn't known it, but it seemed unwise to admit my ignorance.

The winner is the capital and gets to be the center of government for the next year. The Trophy is the symbol of that power, and Veygus has had it for the last five years. Yesterday we finally won it back."
