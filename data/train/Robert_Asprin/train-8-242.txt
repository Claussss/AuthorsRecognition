   "So ... I haven't seen you in here before."    I have been so busy thinkin' about what I am goin' to do to Nunzio to repay him for his "graciousness" that I nearly miss the broad's openin' gambit.    "Oh. No, we just got into town this week. This seems to be turnin' out to be our main hangout, though."    "Hey, that's terrific! This is one of my favorite spots. It's my first time in this week, though. Girl's got to do the rounds to keep up with what's going on in town ... like when new soldiers arrive."
