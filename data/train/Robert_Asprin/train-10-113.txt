   I had no idea how he thought we could have done that, but since I didn't know much about dimension-hopping, I said nothing.    "Not likely," Tanda said. "We are a long, long way from Vortex #1. We're farther away in number of dimensions from      the Bazaar at Deva than I have ever been before."    "Oh," Aahz said.    "And you know that how?" I asked. "Is there some sort of mileage marker I keep missing in the blink of eye it takes to hop to a new dimension?"
