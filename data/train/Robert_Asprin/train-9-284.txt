   "Look out!"    If they wanted physical, I'd give it to them. I mentally grabbed two more trash cans and sent them into the fray, keeping all three flying back and forth in the narrow confines of the alley.    "Cripes! I'm on your side! Remember?" the street vendor cried, ducking under one of my missiles.  I summoned up a little more energy and threw a ward over the two of us. Somehow, I didn't think anyone had thought to use their anti-magik stuff on a garbage can.  A few more swings with the old trash cans, and it was all over.
