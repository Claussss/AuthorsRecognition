"Ki-thus! Kadakithis! No!" Her shriek tears the heart from her breast. Hissing-the beynit's hissing roared in her ears. Her fingers tightened on muscular coils that constricted beneath smooth skin. "Shupansea! My lady, be still now-it was a dream ..." "The prince-" she whispered. "He is here." The Beysa's eyes flew open. His hair was still tousled with sleep, his eyes alarmed, just as in her dream. For a moment she thought she saw that other figure too, shadowy, already fading away. As the prince started towards her, Lady Kurrekai stepped between them. The Beysib woman's arm already bore the twin puncture marks where the beynit had struck her. Her own snake coiled around her neck protectively, tongue flickering as it tested the air; the bite of the Beysa's would do her no harm beyond a little dizziness, but Kadakithis had no such immunity!
