   The Imp grimaced.    "That's an understatement. Come on, sit down. I'll buy you a milkshake and tell you all about it."    I wasn't certain what a milkshake was, but I was sure I didn't want one if they were sold here.    "Urn... thanks anyway, Brockhurst," I said, forcing a smile, "but I think I'll pass."    The Imp arched an eyebrow at me.    "Still a little suspicious, eh?" he murmured. "Well, can't say as I blame you. Tell you what we'll do."
