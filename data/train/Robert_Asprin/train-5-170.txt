   I could feel Gus's eyes on me as she slipped out. "I suppose it's pointless to ask why you didn't say something. Mister Skeeve."    Even though I had worried earlier about getting Gus angry with me, somehow it didn't matter anymore.    "At first it was curiosity," I said, letting my disguise slip away. "Then, I didn't want to embarrass her."    "And at the end there? When she flat-out said that you could talk her out of going? Why didn't you speak up then? Do you want her to disappear?"
