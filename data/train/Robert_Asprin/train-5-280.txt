   "I don't recall â€˜hitting on you,' Bunny."    "Okay, okay. Maybe I have taken to counterpunching before someone else starts. There's been enough of a pattern that I think I'm justified in jumping to conclusions. As I recall, you were a little preoccupied when we met. How would you have reacted if we ran into each other casually in a bar?"    That wasn't difficult at all to imagine... unfortunately.
