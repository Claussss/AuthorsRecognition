   The tunnel sloped upward like a fairly steep ramp. I moved      at a steady pace, making sure that each step was on solid ground. I didn't trust my eyes at this point, after crawling through solid rock.    After about a hundred paces I looked back. Tanda was right behind me, Aahz behind her, and Glenda was managing to stay up with us, only because I was moving so slowly. I didn't feel the slightest bit sorry for her. She had left me to die, and gotten herself into the mess she faced last night. And without us, she wouldn't have this chance to escape. As far as I was concerned, she would either keep up or go out on her own again.
