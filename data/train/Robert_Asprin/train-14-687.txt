   Got him again! Three to two now!    The major was waiting at the on-guard line as the touch was awarded, eager for the bout to resume before his opponent had a chance to analyze the hole in his defense.    "Fencers ready?"    "Ready. "    "Ready, Sir!"    "Allez! Fence!"    BZZZ-UZZ!    "Halt! Both lights are on! Double touch! Score is four to three!"    Four to three! He had to be careful now. One more touch and... No! Jester had been lucky to catch a piece of his arm as he came in on the attack. He had to keep the offensive. Still, his opponent was expecting the shot to the underside of the arm now. Maybe a feint to draw his reaction...
