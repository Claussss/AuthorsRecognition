   I don't remember reaching for Markie, but somehow I had her by the shoulders shaking her.    "WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR??" I said in my best paternal tones.    "You... you said... you wanted the .... candle lit."    "That's lighting a candle?!?"    "I still have a little trouble with control... but my teacher says I'm doing better."    I realized I was having a little trouble with control, too. I stopped shaking her and tried to calm myself.  This effort was aided by the fact that I noticed Markie's lip was quivering and she was blinking her eyes rapidly.
