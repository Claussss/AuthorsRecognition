   "But I don't know you and your connection to this, big guy"    I was so shocked, I couldn't say anything. She had called      Aahz 'big guy,' and knew I had traveled with Tanda.    No one said anything.    Clearly Tanda and Aahz were shocked as well. From what      Tanda had said, we were a lot of dimensions away from our homes. Yet in the middle of a dust storm, in a strange dimension, we had found someone waiting for us. Someone who knew my name.
