lost in the wonder of that moment.             "Hey!"             A rough hand fell on my shoulder and pulled us apart.             "Is this shrimp bothering you, lady?"             The person on the other end of that hand was no taller than I was, but he was twice as broad and had short, twisted tusks protruding from his mouth. His cronies had fanned out behind him, effectively boxing me in against the dung heap.
