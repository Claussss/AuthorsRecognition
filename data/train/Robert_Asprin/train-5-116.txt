   I didn't know what to say. My partner was obviously sincere in his concern, and for a change expressing it in a very calm, low-key manner. Still, I couldn't go along with what he was saying.    "C'mon, Aahz. How much trouble can she be? This thing with Tananda happened because of Bunny..."    "... after Markie started mouthing off at the wrong time. I already had Tananda cooling off when Markie put her two cents in."
