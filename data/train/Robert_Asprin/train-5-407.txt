   "That's the Kid?" I repeated.    Aahz shrugged. "He's had the title for a long time."    The man-mountain had two bags with him which looked very similar to the ones Aahz had carried for us.    He handed them casually to one of the onlookers.    "Cash me in!" he ordered in a booming voice. "I hear there's a game here tonight."    For some reason, this brought a loud round of laughter and applause from the audience. I didn't think it was all that funny, but I smiled politely. The Kid's eyes noted my lack of enthusiasm and glittered with increased ferocity.
