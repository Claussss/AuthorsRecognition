To her credit, Bunny didn't continue to push her case. Instead, she became extremely solicitous. "I'm sorry, Skeeve," she said, laying a hand on my arm. "I didn't mean to jump you like that while you were still drying out. Is there anything I can get you? A cold washrag, maybe?" Actually, that sounded like a wonderful idea. "If you would, please. I'd really appreciate it." She hopped off the bed and made for the washstand while I tried to find a more comfortable position.
