pieces of very  old, damp wood;  they were braced  across the well,  at a slant. Hanse hit, hurt, scrabbled,  clung. His feet were  in water, and his  shins. The wood creaked.

The fist-sized one he next threw struck the well's wall, bounced to roll down Hanse's back, caught a moment at his belt, and dropped into the water.
