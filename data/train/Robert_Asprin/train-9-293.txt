   "I'll bite J.R.," I said, still watching the captain. "What are you seeing that I'm not in this situation?"    "It's what isn't happening that's the tip-off," he winked.  "What isn't happening is we aren't being booked. We've been here a long time and they haven't charged us with any crimes."    "But the Captain here said..."    "He said they could charge us with etc., etc. You notice he hasn't actually done it. Believe me, Mr. Skeeve, if they were going to jail us, we'd have been behind bars an hour ago. They're just playing games to stall for a while." What he said seemed incredible considering the amount of grief we were being put through, yet I couldn't find a hole in his logic. I turned to the captain and raised an eyebrow.
