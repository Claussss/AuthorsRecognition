Hanse flinched at the memory, but gathered himself to rally back. "Why do you want to meet with him? I'd have to tell him something." "Probably not. I believe my name is not exactly unknown to him. Still, if it will ease things, tell him I have a business proposition for him." "What kind of a proposition?" Jubal turned back to the brazier and poked at the coals with the iron as he answered "There's a civil war coming, thief. Not a local upheaval like we've just survived, an Empire-wide struggle. Even you should be able to see that. This town's only hope of success is to rally behind one leader ... and right now Kadakithis would seem to be that leader. I plan to offer him my services . - . mine and my organization's. I believe we can aid him as an intelligence network, providing information and, if need be, stilling dissenting voices. I think even Vashanka's priest would admit our value in that capacity."
