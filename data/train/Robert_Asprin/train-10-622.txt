   The thought sent a shiver through me, and a touch of panic.      "Can we keep going?" I asked.    Tanda took the map and Aahz smiled at me, his green scales      covered in dust, his eyes yellow holes in the dirt. I must have      looked as bad as he did, maybe worse. "A little claustrophobia?"  he asked.    "I don't know about that," I said, not having a clue what the big word meant. Sometimes Aahz just didn't remember what a backward part of a backward world I came from.
