It was a beautiful day in the spring of Sanctuary as Mariat and her three grandchildren overlooked the land recently purchased by the Aquinta Cartel. "There is so much work to be done," Mariat said to Keldrick, Darseeya, and Timock. "And we must never shirk from hard work. For on this land, we will build the new Aquinta." "Keldrick," she said, bringing the boy around to face her. "You are the man of this family now. You must learn to lead as you have learned to be a man. I know you can, for you are the true son of your father and grandfather."
