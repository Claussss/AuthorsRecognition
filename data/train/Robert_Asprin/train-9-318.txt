   The street vendor thought for a few moments.    "Even with backing I'd want to start small and build.  Figuring that... yeah. I think about five thousand in gold would start things off right."    "Oh," I said, intelligently. I wasn't about to question his figures, but the start-up cost was higher than I had expected. I only had a couple thousand with me, and most of that was going to cover Edvick's services and the hotel bill. So much for a grand gesture!
