   For some reason Aahz and Tanda had left me the D-Hop     per and the map. More than likely they had suspected Glenda,      while I had been too blind with lust or love to see anything.    I looked at the D-Hopper to make sure I wasn't hallucinating in the heat. It was real.  I held it up like an idol and did a little dance of joy right there behind the rock. For the first time I had some options. I could do something instead of just waiting and hoping. The relief was almost more than I could take.
