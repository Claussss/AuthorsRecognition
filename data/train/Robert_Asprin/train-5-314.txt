   "Skeeve, this is garbage," Tananda said at last.  "Aahz folded a better hand than this without his hole cards. I had you beat on the board."    "What she's trying to say, partner," Aahz smirked, "is that you should have either folded or raised. Calling the bet when the cards she has showing beat your hand is just tossing away money."    "Okay, okay! I get the point."    "Do you? You've still got about fifty chips there. Are you sure you don't want to wait until you've lost those, too? Of maybe we should redivide the chips and start over ... again."
