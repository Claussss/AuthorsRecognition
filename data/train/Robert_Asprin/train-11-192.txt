   Our conversation ground to a halt as we reached our destination, a small room sparsely furnished with a large table surrounded by several chairs.    "If you'll be seated, gentlemen," our host said, gesturing to the chairs, "perhaps you'll be good enough to tell me what it is you wish to speak to me about."    "Not so fast," Aahz challenged, holding up a hand. "We're used to knowing who we're dealing with. Could you do us the courtesy of removing your disguise before we start?"
