   Every policeman in the room suddenly tensed, and I realized too late that there was also no profit in critiquing the police.    "... And if we don't check on suspicious characters before they make trouble, then all we're good for is filling out reports AFTER a crime had been committed," the captain spat bitterly. "Either way, â€˜innocent citizens' like you can find something to gripe about!"    "I'm sorry. Captain. I shouldn't have..." I don't know if he even heard my attempted apology. If he did, it didn't make a difference.
