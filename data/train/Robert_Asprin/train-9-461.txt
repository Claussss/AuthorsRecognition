Chapter Twenty:    "Were you looking for me?"    â€”DR. LIVINGSTONE    I WAS SURPRISED to find Pookie waiting for me when I got back to the hotel. The police had been nice enough to wait until I had given her her check before hauling me off, so I had thought I'd never see her again.    "Hello, Pookie. What brings you here?"    "I wanted to talk a little business with you," she said. "It didn't seem the right time before, so I waited."
