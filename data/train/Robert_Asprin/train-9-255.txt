   "Happy now?"    "I'd be happier if you picked something that was a little less salty," Kalvin grimaced, "but I suppose it's better than nothing."    The bartender delivered my pitcher along with a basket of popcorn, then wandered off to greet some new patrons who had just wandered in. I tossed a handful of the popcorn into my mouth and chewed it while I refilled my glass from the pitcher. It was actually more spicy than salty, which made me revise some of my earlier thoughts about the universality of junk food, but I decided not to mention this discovery to Kalvin. He was fussing at me enough already.  "So, what do you want to talk about?" I said, forcing myself not to immediately wash down the popcorn with a long drink from the glass.
