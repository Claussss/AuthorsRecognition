Jubal  risked a  glance over  his shoulder.  The gutter-rats  of Sanctuary  were descending on the courtyard. Scores of them! Scrabbling over the wooden cases or swarming down from the roofs like spiders. Children in rags - none of them  even half Jubal's height, but with knives, rocks, and sharp sticks. Another man might have broken before those hate-filled eyes. He might have tried to beg or bribe his way out  of the trap, claiming ignorance of Gambi's  murder.
