   Aahz glanced around, then turned to me. "Ready?"    "Sure," I said.    "Keep it slower than before," Aahz said. "We don't want      to run into anything out here."    I concentrated on the power coming into my body, easier      here than back near Evade. When I had enough I lifted us slightly off the ground and headed down the road. Outside of town the road was straight, running between what looked like pastures, and even in the moonlight I could get us up to a pretty decent speed.
