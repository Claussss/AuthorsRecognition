   But today, while searching through my pouch for some     thing else, I found the map. While I honestly didn't know what it was, I thought it might be what I needed to bait Aahz into taking me dimension traveling again.    Aahz still wasn't about to touch the parchment. He mo     tioned to the fire.    "Throw it in there and then get back to your practice."    "I'm done with my practice," I said.
