It was suddenly very quiet in the inn. The moment seemed to hang in the air as everyone tensed and waited to see what would happen next. Blood was pounding in my ears. I heard the bench behind me slide as Aahz started to get up, and I signaled behind me with my hand for him to stay out of it. "I have no intention of putting any 'moves' on these women either now or in the future," I said carefully. "The young lady there came to my table and said that her friend wanted to meet me. I was about to comply. Period. That's it. It was an effort on my part to be polite. If, as it seems, it is somehow offensive to you or anyone else here, I'll forego the pleasure."
