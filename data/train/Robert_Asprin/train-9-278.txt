   Just to be on the safe side, I doubled up on the ward in front of him... and he walked right through it!    "That's what I thought!" he called to his cronies, pausing once he had penetrated my defenses. "Real low level stuff.  Go to Class Two or heavier, guys... in fact, the heavier the better!"    I should have seen it coming... maybe would have if I had more time to think. In a dimension that used both magik and technology, there were bound to be counter magik spells and weapons available. Unfortunately, it seemed I was about to learn about them first hand!
