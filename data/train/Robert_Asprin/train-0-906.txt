Then he stood and said, "Since State intends to stick an oar in, we'll let the violations of orders slide-this time. But it would be in the captain's best interests to learn to do things the Legion way. Ambassador, thank you for the drink."    "You're welcome, General," said Ambassador Gottesman genially. "The Legion will profit by this in the long run."
