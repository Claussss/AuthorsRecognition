Ischade nodded,  holding the  gate. Mriga  went in,  and with  true sunrise, the influences  of the  underworld died  away and  let day  reassert itself:  grimy, pallid dawn over  Sanctuary, reeking  with smoke  and the  faint taint  of blood ghost-haunted, dismal, and bitter cold as  befitted the first day of winter.  At Ischade's back, the White Foal flowed and stank, filmed here and there with ice.
