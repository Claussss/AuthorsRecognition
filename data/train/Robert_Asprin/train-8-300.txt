   "That shouldn't be hard," I snarl, and launch myself at the door.    I have specifically mentioned our objective of "confusion" so that youse folks readin' this will not think your brains have suddenly gone Fruit Loops while tryin' to sort out this next series of events ... that is, it's supposed to be â€˜confusion'!    Anyway, the door goes down, as doors are inclined to do when I hit them goin' full tilt, and the two of us pile into the room ... which I am not too busy to notice is considerably nicer than the room Frumple gave me yesterday.
