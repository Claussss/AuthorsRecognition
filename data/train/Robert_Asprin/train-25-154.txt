"What is it, Steve? Did you see something?" Without answering, Tidwell stopped the film, reversed it, then started it again. Again the knifeman circled. Again the two mercenaries appeared on the screen. Tidwell punched the hold button and the action froze. He rose from his chair and slowly approached the screen. Then he thoughtfully sipped his drink and stared at a point away from the main action. He stared at Kumo. Kumo, the old sensei who never showed emotion. In the split second frozen by the camera, at the instant the two men stepped past him and interrupted the demonstration, in that fleeting moment as he looked at Tidwell's back, Kunio's face was contorted in an expression of raw, naked hatred.
