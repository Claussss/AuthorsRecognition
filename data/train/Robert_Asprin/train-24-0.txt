  Robert Asprin   The Bug Wars "REMINDER" by Buck Coulson The stardrive was discovered on a planet in Centaurus, By a race that built their cities when the Earth was burning gas. They swept across the starlanes in the dawning of creation, And a million years of empire came to pass. Their successors were a swarm of mighty insects from Orion. They did not have the stardrive, but they did not ever die.
