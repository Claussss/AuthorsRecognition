  "Backdoor?"   I pulled away the tapestry to reveal the door I had spotted during our first tour. It was heavy wood with strange symbols painted on it. It also had a massive beam guarding it, and several smaller but no less effective-looking locks around the edge.   "I tried to say something at the time, but you kept telling me to shut up."   "I did, didn't I."   We both stared at the door in silence for several minutes.
