   Some of you may wonder why I am choosing this point of the narrative to expound on the subject of female Pervects.  The rest of you have already figured it out. For the former, let it suffice to say that the bodyguard Edvick introduced me to was a female.    We found her in a bar, a lounge, actually, which the cabbie informed me she used as an office between jobs.  She didn't move or blink as we approached her table, which I came to realize meant she had been watching us from the moment we walked through the door. Edvick slid into a vacant chair at her table without invitation and motioned me into another.
