"Good. Has Horc spoken to you about the skimmer design?" "Yes, Commander." "What is your opinion?" "While it was enlightening to learn a Technician shares the Warriors' opinion of the skimmers, I declined his offer." This answer was unexpected. "Explain, Zur." "Although obviously unstable, the skimmers are still the fastest means of ground transport available to us. As the mission progresses, we will be forced to canvass farther and farther afield seeking specimens for the Scientists. To accomplish this efficiently, we will have to cover great stretches of ground as fast as possible. While the flyers can serve to a certain degree as spotters, actual observations and capture can only be effected at ground level."
