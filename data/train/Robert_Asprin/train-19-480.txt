"Are you seeing her?" Crit shouted into his face. "You know I'm not," Strat said. "I'm in barracks every night!" Crit grabbed him by the throat. If Crit strangled him that was all right.

Strat only stared, short of wind, and said, "Better if you hadn't pulled me out of that cellar ... Better you'd left me there."
