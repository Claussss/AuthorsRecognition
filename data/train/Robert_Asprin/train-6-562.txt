   That triggered an idea in my mind. It seemed silly, but nothing else had worked.    Drawing my eyebrows together, I addressed the brazier without focusing my energies on it.    "Come here!" I thought.    The brazier seemed to waiver for a moment, then it trotted to my side, clacking across the floor on its spindly legs.    It worked! Even though it was a silly little detail, the brazier's obedience somehow made me feel more like a magician.
