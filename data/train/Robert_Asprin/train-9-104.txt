   I stood there for a few more moments in sheer disbelief, then turned and marched back over to the bag.  "Now you're starting to move like a Pervect," the Djin observed.    "I don't care,'-â€˜ I snarled. "And that's Pervert! I've tried to be nice... didn't want to mess up their display...  but, if they insist..."    For the next several minutes I took my anger out on the bag, which was probably the safest object to vent my spleen on. I hefted it, swung it over my head, slammed it against the floor a couple times, and did everything else to it I could think of short of climbing inside. I've got to admit the thing was sturdily made. Then again, I was starting to see why goods on Perv had to be tough. The salesmen never favored me with so much as a glance.
