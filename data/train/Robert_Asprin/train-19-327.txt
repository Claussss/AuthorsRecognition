"I have a job for you, Mange," Bakarat said, addressing the oldest of the three men across the table from him. Like the Toad himself, the man he spoke to fully warranted his nickname. Mange was a bounty hunter. And on one too many nights of sleeping on the forest floor of the swamps, he had picked up a rare scalp disease which caused his hair to fall out in patches. Hence the unkind name "Mange." "What is it?" the patchy-headed man replied. "The boys and I are always happy to be of service to you."
