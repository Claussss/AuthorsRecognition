   "I'm in the middle of a conference, Guido!" I called.  "Tell them to come back later."    "Suit yourself, Boss!" came the reply. "I just thought you'd want to know, seein' as how it's Luanna..."    I was off like a shot, not even bothering to excuse myself. Aahz would understand. He knew I'd had a thing for Luanna since our expedition into Limbo.    On my way to the waiting room, I had time to speculate as to whether or not this was one of my bodyguard's little pranks. I decided that if it was, I would study hard until I knew enough magic to turn him into a toad.
