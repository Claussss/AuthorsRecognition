"Ginny!" He was rewarded by seeing her start guiltily before hitting her own intercom button. "Yes, Pete?" "I'm heading up to Eddie's office. Hold all calls till I get back." "How long will you be?" "Don't know. It's one of his surprise calls." He clicked off the intercom and started across his office. As he approached the south wall, a portion slid back and he entered the executive corridor, stepping onto the eastbound conveyor. He nodded recognition to another executive striding purposefully along the westbound conveyor, but remained standing, letting the conveyor carry him along at a sedate four miles an hour. Corridor-walking varied by section. Some crews walked, some ran in an effort to show frenzied enthusiasm or pseudoimportance. Eddie set the code for their group. Let the convey do it. We're smoothly run to the point to where we don't have to dash around like a bunch of panicked rodents.
