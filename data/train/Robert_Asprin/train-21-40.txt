This surprised me a little, as the crew usually followed me into my room without missing a step or a syllable of conversation. Then I noticed that the others of our group had also halted short of the door and were watching me with a smile. I couldn't figure what was going on. I mean, so Bunny was waiting inside. So what? It was just Bunny. Nevertheless I took my cue, nodding at them vaguely as I opened the door.
