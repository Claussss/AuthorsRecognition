CHAPTER FOURTEEN    Journal #245    As near as I can determine, Maxine Pruet was either ignoring the presence of the Space Legion company under my employer's command or operating under the old assumption that if you cut off the head, the body dies.

That is, it had the effect of removing the emergency brakes from a locomotive and putting it on a straight, downhill stretch of tracks.
