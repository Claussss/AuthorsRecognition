Inside, the smith was hunched over a mug of tea, a crossbow's trigger  mechanism dismantled before  him on  a split  of suede,  scowling at  the crossbow's  guts spread upon his counter as if at a recalcitrant child. He looked up when  they entered, wished them  a better morning than  he'd had so far this day, and went to get Straton's case of nights. Behind the counter an assortment of high-torque bows was hung.
