   To say the least, I found her manner puzzling. I had never seen Massha so upset. This was obviously not the time for questions, though, so I looked around for Markie.  She was standing, fists clenched, glaring at a tent with a closed flap.    All of a sudden everyone was getting uptight. First Massha, and now Markie.    "What's with the kid?" I said, tapping Guide on the shoulder.    "Bunny's in trying on some peek-a-boo nighties, and the owner chased Markie out," my bodyguard explained. "She don't like it much, but she'll get over it.  It's part of bein' a kid, I guess."
