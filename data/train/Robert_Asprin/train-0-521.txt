   "Jester here-what's the story, Top?"    "Still trying to find out myself, Captain. C.H. and the Synthians are out scouting. No sign of the shooter yet. You all right?"    "Not a scratch. How about the rest?"    "A few scrapes and bruises when people ducked for cover, but nothing serious. Rev split a seam in his uniform."    Phule chuckled. "Don't tell me where, I swear I don't want to know. Listen now, Brandy-I want you to secure the area so the civilians can get out of danger. Send the Gambolts to scout those rooftops, too. We can't stay pinned down here all day just because of one sniper."
