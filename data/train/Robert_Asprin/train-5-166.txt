   "Well, it's something Markie said..."    Markie again. I definitely owed Aahz an apology.    "... She made some crack about her daddy, that's Skeeve, letting me live there, and it got me to thinking.  Things have been nice these last couple years ... almost too nice. Since we haven't had to worry about overhead, Chumley and I haven't been working much. More important, we haven't been working at working. It's too easy to hang around the place and wait for something to come to us."
