Chapter Seventeen;       "Ya gotta speak the language."       -N. WEBSTER    "HEY, SWATTER." Shu Flie sez, lookin' out one of the warehouse windows, "do you know there are a buncha wagons and drivers sitting outside?"    "No," I sez, "but if you hum a couple bars, I'll fake it."    Okay, so it's an old joke. Like I've said before, the army runs on old jokes. Unfortuitously, this particular joke is apparently a little too old for our farm-raised colleague.
