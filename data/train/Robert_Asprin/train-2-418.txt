the crowd figured out what Aahz was up to about the same time I did. With a howl they were after us.             Surprisingly, I overtook Aahz. Either he was holding back so I could catch up, or I was more scared than I thought, which is impossible.             "Now what?" I panted.             "Shut up and keep running, kid," Aahz barked, ducking around a knot of             "They're gaining on us," I pointed out.
