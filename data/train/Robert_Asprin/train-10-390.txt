   "So now what do we do?"    "We go take a closer look," Aah2 said, laughing. "See what      we can see."    I glanced at my mentor. He was always happy when there      was a chance we might end up with a lot of money. I didn't want to ask him how he thought we were going to get any of the gold we could see from here, but clearly he had ideas, and the ideas were enough to make him smile.    All his smile did was worry me.
