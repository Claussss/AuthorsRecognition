The old storyteller felt a rare twinge of remorse as he left the Unicorn.  While he had no love for One-Thumb, neither had he any reason to wish him ill. The big man hadn't just lost a year of his life - he'd lost his fire - that core of ferocity which had  earned him the respect  of the town's underworld.  Though One-Thumb was unmarked  physically, he was  only the empty  shell of his  former self. This town was no place for a man without the strength to back his bluster.
