For a moment, Bunny seemed about to say something else, but instead she pursed her lips and wandered over to the window where she stood staring out. My head was clearing now, to a point where I felt almost alive, and I decided it was time to try to set things right. "Um ... Bunny? About last night ... I'm sorry I left you standing like that, but Vie had set up the date for me, and there was no real way to back out gracefully."
