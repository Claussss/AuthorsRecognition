   "I wonder what they're watching for?" I said, almost to myself. I say almost because I forgot for the moment that Kalvin was hovering within easy hearing.    "Who? Them? They're probably watching for the police."    "The police? Why?"    "For the usual reason... what they're doing is illegal."    "It is?"    I had no desire to have another run-in with the police, but I was genuinely puzzled. Maybe I was missing some thing, but I couldn't see anything untoward about the street vendors' activities.
