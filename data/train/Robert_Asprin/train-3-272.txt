too hard, Kama craved only open violence.  She'd have killed a Stepson or a  3rd Commando ranger, one of her own, if any dared cross her this evening. She  stopped  in at  the  Unicorn, half-hoping  for  a fight,  but  no one  paid attention to her there. She wandered back streets on  a borrowed horse, letting it  drift barracks-ward, until she realized that it had brought her to the White Foal Bridge.
