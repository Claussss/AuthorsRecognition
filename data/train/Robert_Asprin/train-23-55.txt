"If we're armed better than they are, with better sensors than normal so that we can see them before they know we're in the area, they're in trouble." "Maybe." Abuzar conceded reluctantly. "But equip-ment like that could cost a small fortune." "We've got a small fortune," Eisner shot back. "The first thing we'll have to do is find out what armaments and sensor equipment are available, and how much they cost."
