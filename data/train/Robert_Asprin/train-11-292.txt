   That's one of the things I do best-scream in panic.    For a moment, no one seemed to hear us. Then a few heads turned. A couple voices took up my call.    "Ta-hoers!" they cried. "We're being attacked."    The word spread through the crowd ahead of us like wildfire, such that when we reached the rearguard of the procession, it had ground to a halt. The soldiers milled about, tangling weapons with bodies around them as they tried simultaneously to scan the crowd, rooftops, and sky.
