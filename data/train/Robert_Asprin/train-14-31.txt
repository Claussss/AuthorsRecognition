"But he didn't... and you know Legion regulations as well as I do. We can level any kind of punishment we want on a Legionnaire, but we can't drum them out of the service. He can resign, but we can't force him to quit."    "Maybe if the sentence was rough enough, he'd resign rather than accept it," Captain Humpty suggested hopefully.
