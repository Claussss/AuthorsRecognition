  "Face it, kid," I said to myself in my best imitation of Aahz. "You owe a lot to your old mentor."   Right. A lot. Like not making him ashamed of his prize pupil... say by leaving a job half done.   With new resolve, I addressed my situation. First, I had to get back to Klah ... or should I look for a solution right here?   Rather than lose time to indecision, I compromised.   With a few specific questions to the nearest vendor, I set a course for my eventual destination, keeping an eye out as I went for something that would help me solve the Queen Hemlock problem. This trip through the Bazaar was different from my earlier visits. Before, my experience had been of wishing for more time to study the displays at leisure while hurrying to keep up with Aahz. This time, it was me that was pushing the pace, dismissing display after display with a casual "interesting, but no help with today's problem." Things seemed to have a different priority when responsibility for the crisis was riding on my shoulders. Of course, I didn't know what I was looking for. I just knew that trick wands and instant thunderstorms weren't it. Out of desperation, I resorted to logic.
