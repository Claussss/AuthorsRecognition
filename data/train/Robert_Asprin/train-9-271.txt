   That was the same individual talking. If he noticed me talking to Kalvin, which to him would look like talking to thin air, he didn't seem to mind or care.    "That's right," one of his cronies chimed in. "We figure what you got in your pockets ought to just about cover it."    "Quick! Back inside!" Kalvin hissed.    "Way ahead of you," I murmured, feeling behind myself for the door.    I found it... sort of. The door was there, but there was no handle on this side. Apparently the bar owners wanted it used for exits only. Terrific.
