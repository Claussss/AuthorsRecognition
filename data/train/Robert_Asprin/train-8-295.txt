   "I dunno, I guess we wait until we hear Tananda start callin' for help."    I swivel my head around and stare at him.    "Nunzio," I sez, "has it occurred to you that with the racket goin' on down here, she can shoot off a cannon and we won't be able to hear her?"    This brings a scowl to his face.    "Good point," he sez, borrowin' a sip from my drink.    "Good point? Is that all you got to say?" I am startin' to get worked up now. "What do you think is gonna happen if we miss our cue and don't break things up?"
