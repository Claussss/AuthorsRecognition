   "Thirty to fifty million dollars," Stilman said, saying the words in a soft, almost reverent voice.    "Before you ask," Max added with a smile, "those are, of course, our people manning the key machines right now. No sense letting all that money fall into the wrong hands."    "At ten thousand dollars a minute," Laverna put in.    Max blinked. "What's that, Laverna?"    "Five fifty-dollar tokens per pull, times ten machines, times at least four pulls a minute, is ten thousand dollars a minute they're pumping into those machines by my count," her aide clarified. "I assume they're only playing minimum bets until the right time comes, but even if they only play for ten minutes after the flag goes up, that's one hundred thousand dollars they'll be going through."
