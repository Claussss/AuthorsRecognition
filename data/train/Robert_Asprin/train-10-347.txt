    map again." I had just finished my entire glass of carrot juice      and was feeling really, really alive and well.    Aahz glanced at the kitchen door again, then asked me, "You feel up to it?"    "I feel like I'm getting stronger the farther we come," I said.    "Let him try," Tanda said. "Might save us a lot of back-     tracking."    Aahz looked at me, then nodded.  "Give it a shot."    I took a deep breath and let my mind search out the power in the map. For an instant I didn't think anything was going to happen. Then I felt it. The power rushed through me from the map as I hastily directed it into the ground. My head spun for a second, and it was done. The power was gone and the map was normal...for now. I took a deep breath, again feeling the strain. I needed more carrot juice.
