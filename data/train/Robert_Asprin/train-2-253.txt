            He seemed not to hear me.             "Imps!" he chortled, rubbing his hands together gleefully. "What a stroke of luck!"             "Aahz! They're going to kill me!"             "Hm? Relax, kid. Like I said. Imps are gullible. If they were really thinking, they would have shot us down without talking. I haven't met an Imp yet I couldn't talk circles around."             He cocked his head, listening.
