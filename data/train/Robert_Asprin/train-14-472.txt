   "I'd heard that, too."    "Well, what are you going to do about it?"    Phule regarded her levelly.    "Nothing."    "Nothing? But she-"    "Since I figure doing nothing is better than seeing your partner brought up on charges."    Super Gnat blinked, hesitating in her tirade.    "Charges? I don't understand, Captain."    "Sit down, Gnat," Phule instructed calmly. "If I take official notice of what happened, then I'll have to acknowledge all the eyewitness accounts of Tusk-anini launching an attack on Sergeant Brandy... an attack that ended when she knocked him cold defending herself. I don't want to have to do that, so unless that bitch, as you called her, decides to press charges, I'm willing to pretend the whole thing never happened."
