I am  building Your  accursed temple  as fast  as I  can. I  am no priest, to be terrified by  loud words  and bright  manifestations. Get  Thee hence, and leave this slum unenlightened. They do not deserve me, and they do not deserve You!' A gust sighed fiercely, flapping Tempus's woollens against his mail beneath. 'I have sent  you hither to  build Me a  temple among the  heathens, 0 sleepless one! A temple you will build!'
