   I took the sack and carefully selected one of the small bags from its interior.    "Better toss it to the ground, kid," Aahz cautioned. "Some folks can set it off in their hand, but that takes practice. If you tried it that way now, you'd probably lose a few fingers."    I obediently tossed the bag on the ground a few feet away. Watching it curiously, I focused a quick burst of energy on it.    There was a bright flash of light accompanied by a soft pop. Blinking my eyes, I looked at where the bag had been. A small cloud of green smoke hung in the air, slowly dissipating in the breeze.
