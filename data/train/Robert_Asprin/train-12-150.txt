   you trying to say we still have the same appearance as    before I cast the spell?"   One of the problems with casting a disguise spell is    that as the caster, I can never see the effects. That is, I    see people as they really are whether the spell is on or    not. I had gotten so used to relying on the effects of this    particular spell that it had never occurred to me that it    might not work.
