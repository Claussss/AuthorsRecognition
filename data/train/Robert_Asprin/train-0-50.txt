   "That's unusual," said Phule, his eyebrows rising. "Any injuries?"    "None reported, sir," Moustache said. "A bit of broken furniture, but that was replaced in no time at all."    "Well, that's good," said Phule. He stopped, and turned to face the older man. "How long ago was this?"    "Right after you left, sir," said the sergeant. "Coming up on forty minutes ago. After the first flurry, Sushi and the man left together. Sushi told Do-Wop he had things under control, but didn't give details. And he turned off his communicator as they left. We have the woman in custody-she turned tame as a puppy after the man stopped fighting-but she's not talking. I doubt she knows where they are, anyway. We certainly don't."
