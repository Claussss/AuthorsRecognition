   With that, we each grab Junebug by one arm and usher him out of the room through the crowd that's startin' to gather. I look back at Tananda and give her a wink, but she just sticks her tongue out at me quick-like before continuin' her hysterics.    "WHAT KIND OF A PLACE IS THIS?" she screams after us. "Letting animals like that mix with decent people ..."    I lose the rest of her performance as we are carryin' Junebug down to the main floor by now.
