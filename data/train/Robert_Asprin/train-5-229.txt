   She spread her fingers and made a quick inventory.    "Sure. This little trinket right here could do the job, but that's not the point."    "Bear with me. How does it work? Or, more important, how does it feel when it works?"    She gave a quick shrug.    "There's nothing to it. You see, this circle around the stone here moves, and I rotate it according to how tight a beam I want. Pressing the back of the ring activates it, so all I have to do is aim it and relax. The ring does all the work."
