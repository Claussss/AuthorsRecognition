The second demon flew at her. Again she swung, Striking at the neck as she sidestepped, and again there came a red flash as sword touched demon flesh. Twice more she chopped.

It clutched its vaporous body suddenly, and with taloned fingers, as if to end its agony, it ripped itself apart and discorporated.
