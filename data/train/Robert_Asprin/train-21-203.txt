Limbo! The dimension of werewolves and vampires. I had only been there once, and the memory wasn't all that pleasant. "Urn, I'd rather not if you don't mind." "Really? Why not?" "Well ... if you must know, my dimension traveling skills aren't all they could be," I said, blurting out the first thing that came into my mind. Actually, my ability to travel the dimensions without the mechanical aid of a D-Hopper was non-existent, but I saw no need to be too honest.
