   "Well, you might remind our Fearless Leader that he's got some folks out here who are a little curious about what's happening."    "I'll do my best ... and Brandy? Thanks again."

Becker was not in the Legion chain of command, being privately employed by Phule, and was therefore doubly constrained from relaying information ... both by military procedure and by his professional ethic as a butler. His position did, however, allow him one privilege not accessible to the Legionnaires, that of entering the commander's private quarters without being specifically summoned, and he freely exercised that privilege now, pausing only briefly after knocking before opening the door.
