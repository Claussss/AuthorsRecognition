   "What is it?" I asked politely.    For a response, she grinned and held whatever it was in front of her. Then she opened her grip and disappeared into thin air.    "Invisibility," Aahz exclaimed. "A cloak of invisibility!"    "Couldn't afford one," came Tanda's voice from somewhere in front of us. "I had to settle for one of these."    What "one of these" was, it turned out, was a sheet of invisibility. It was a sheet of stiff material about three feet by seven feet. Tanda had been carrying it rolled up in a tube, and her disappearance had been caused by the sheet unrolling to its full size.
