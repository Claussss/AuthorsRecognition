   "Hey Guido!" comes a familiar voice, interruptin' my thoughts. "What's the word?"    I looked around to find Nunzio and the rest of the crew bearin' down on me.    "No big deal," I shrugs. "We don't even go on duty until tomorrow. The commander's given us the rest of the day to settle in and check out the town."    "Sounds good to me," Hy Flie sez, rubbin' his hands together like ... well, like a fly. "What say we get something to eat ... and at the same time see if we can find a place to hang out on our off-duty hours."
