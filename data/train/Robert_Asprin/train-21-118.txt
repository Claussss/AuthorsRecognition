Things were never going to be the same for me. Whether I married Queen Hemlock or, if refused, she abdicated and left me to run the kingdom on my own, I was going to be committed to stay in Possiltum a long time. A very long time. I couldn't do that and maintain an office on Deva! Would we have to move our operation here to Klah? For that matter, could I be either a consort or a king and still do a responsible job as the president of M.Y.T.H. Inc.?
