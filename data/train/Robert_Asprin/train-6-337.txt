   Gleep had wandered off shortly after our arrival, though we could still hear him occasionally as he poked about in the underbrush.    "You go get the dragon, Tanda," Aahz ordered.    "Though it escapes me how he's supposed to be any help. The â€˜boss' here and I have to discuss his war council tomorrow."    Any confidence I might have built up listening to Aahz's grand plan earlier fled me. Tanda was right. We had run out of time.
