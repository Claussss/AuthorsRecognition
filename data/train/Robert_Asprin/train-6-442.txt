   The box had been big, better than thirty feet long and twenty feet high, but from the look of the dragon he must have been cramped for space inside.    He was big! I mean, really big!    Now I've never kidded myself about Gleep's size. Though his ten-foot length might look big here on Klah, I had seen dragons on Deva that made him look small. The dragon currently facing us, however, dwarfed everything I had seen before.
