"Yes, Aahz," I nodded, starting off at a trot.    "And whatever you do, don't eat the food!"    "Are you kidding?" I laughed. "I've been here before."    The food at the Yellow Crescent Inn is dubious at best. Even after dimension hopping with Tananda and seeing what was accepted as food elsewhere, I wouldn't put anything from that place in my mouth voluntarily.
