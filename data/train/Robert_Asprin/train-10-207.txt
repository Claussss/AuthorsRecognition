   I took a tentative sip of my drink and damn near spat it all      over the table. It wasn't orange juice at all. It tasted like pulped      carrots. Sour-tasting carrots.    "Interesting," Glenda said after taking a drink. Then she turned to me and made a face that only I could see. She didn't much like it either.    I glanced around at the other patrons in the place. Every     one had a glass of the carrot drink in front of them. It looked as if it was the only drink the place served.
