   The little man stopped and turned to face him, regarding him levelly with dark eyes.    "Must get meat inside," he said. "Not good to leave out here. Too warm. Might go bad."    "Maybe you didn't get the drift of what I was saying," Stilman challenged, moving closer. "You can't unload that stuff while we're around."    The little man bobbed his head.    "Good. You take."    With that, he half tossed, half thrust the meat at Stilman, shoving it forward as the balance came off his shoulder. The headman was unprepared for the weighty mass suddenly launched at him, but he managed to catch it-more from surprise than intent.
