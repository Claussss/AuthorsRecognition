   "I don't get it," Nunzio frowned. "What went wrong?"    "Why, the fire of course. You know, the fire that destroyed the entire shipment due to our inattentiveness and neglect? Terribly careless of us, wasn't it?"    "Fire? What fire?"    Skeeve stepped to one side and bowed to me, sweeping one hand toward the cases.    "Gleep? I believe this is your specialty?"    I waffled briefly between using a #4 or a #6, then said "to heck with it" and cut loose with a #9. It was a bit show-offy, I'll admit, but with Guide and Nunzio watching, not to mention my pet, it was pointless to spare the firepower.
