   The commander shook his head slightly.    "The problem is that you're a cynic. If you had been around when the Wright brothers were designing their first plane, you would have been the one saying, 'It'll never fly.' Then, as it passed overhead on its maiden flight, your only comment would've been, 'They'll never get it down!"'    A ghost of a smile flitted across the top sergeant's face.    "You got me there, Captain," she admitted.
