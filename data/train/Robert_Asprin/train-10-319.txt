   "So which way do we go?" Tanda asked.    The two towns next in line from Baker were named Bank      and Keep. Both looked to be about the same distance from here, but Bank was to the right in the north and Keep was to the left in the south.    "Bank," I said, before I even realized the word was out of      my mouth.    "Why?" Aahz asked, staring at me, his intense eyes scary in the semi-dark.    "I don't know," I said. "It just seems right, and starts with the same letter as Baker."
