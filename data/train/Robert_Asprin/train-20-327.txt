Houses leaned close together above him now, cutting off the sky. In some of  the windows lamplight glowed, though most of them were tightly shuttered, edged  and chinked with light that dappled the worn cobbles below. Lalo winced as a  murmur of voices exploded into abuse. A mangy dog that had been nosing at something  in the gutters looked up at the noise, then went back to its meal. Lalo shuddered, visualizing death as a starving jackal-hound waiting to  spring.
