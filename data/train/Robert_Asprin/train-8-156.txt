   That was all I needed to hear. As a last precaution, I glance back at Nunzio where he's standin' in line, and he gives me a little nod with his head.    "Your cousin can't help you now. Guide," Smiley snaps, regainin' a bit of confidence. "This is between you and me."    That wasn't why I was checkin' with Nunzio, but I have no trouble goin' with the flow, bein' real adaptable when the music is startin' and I am one of the designated dancers.
