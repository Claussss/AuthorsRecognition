Tambu frowned. "Isn't that a sealed system? When was it last inspected?" "Two years ago," Ramona recited. "During its scheduled preventative maintenance cycle." "Then the problem's been with us that long?" Tambu winced. "No," Ramona insisted firmly. "It's a recent development." "You seem awfully sure of that." "I am, for two reasons. First, it was triple-checked during that inspection. I know the crewmembers whose initials were on the seal. They aren't the kind who would fake an inspection or miss a defect that obvious."
