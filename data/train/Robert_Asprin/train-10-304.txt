   What had cost me an hour of walking earlier had only taken      two or three minutes of flying. Why hadn't I thought of that      this morning?    I slowed and put us down at a normal walking pace. The moment I let go of the power I stumbled, but Tanda kept me      from falling on my face. It was as if every bit of energy had      been drained from my muscles, leaving them weak and noodle-like. "You'll be fine in a moment," Aahz said, keeping us walking at a good pace toward the now close edge of town.
