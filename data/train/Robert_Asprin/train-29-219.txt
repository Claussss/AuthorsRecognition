And the sound, the half-human sound that came from somewhere in the depths, ran right through his nerves. He did not stop. He saw the steps and he went, writhed his way through a hole too small for a man to take easily, down into the echoing dark. "Stilcho!" he heard Ischade whisper urgently. He heard the slither of someone behind him, but another such moan wrenched at his gut. He felt his way down and down, one hand for the sword, one for the wall, his eyes straining at dark absolute except the little gray light that got through from the open trap above, and that fitful, with his partners leaning over it.
