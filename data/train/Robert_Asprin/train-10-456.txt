   With one more look at the map, I folded it and put it back      in my pouch.    Then I headed through the tables of bodies to the back wall. As I went I wanted to talk to the bodies, tell them I'd be right back, tell them to wait, to reserve a table for me. But I kept my morbid thoughts to myself.    There was a large cabinet of medical supplies filling the      back wall and no hidden panel that I could see. From what the map had shown, the panel was right behind the cabinet.
