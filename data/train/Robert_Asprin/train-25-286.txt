"Frankly," Wolfe's eyes were cold, "I hadn't planned to." He strode through the common corridors, head high, ahead of his guard. He had a disembodied, unearthly feeling, like he was walking in a dream. He was screwed! No one would hire him now. Job hunting at his pay level without a job or a recommendation! C'mon, Pete! You can work it out later. First try to put a little style into the exit. He forced himself back into focus and began to look around him. Maybe a few casual nods or a wink or a wave at a couple of people on his way out. He suddenly realized he didn't know anyone in the halls. Nobody looked at him. Not that they were avoiding his eyes; they were all busy and their eyes passed over him as unimportant. Just a few curious glances at the guard. He didn't see any of his staff. Usually there were a few of them around.
