realize what I had let myself in for. A brand-new author, barely published,  and I was going to try to edit an anthology? Soliciting contributions from the  best in the field,  yet! That revelation  sobered me up  faster than a  bucket of ice water and a five-day hotel bill. Still, the ball was already rolling, and I had story commitments from Gordy  and John. I might as well see how far things could go.
