   Despite my continuing concern over his attention to his driving, the cabbie was beginning to interest me.  "I must say you're enterprising enough. Cab driver, publisher, cook, translator... is there anything else you do?"    "Oh, I'm into a lot of things. Photography, tour guide...  I even draw a little. Some of these drawings I did. I'd be willing to part with them for the right price." He gestured at some of the sheets adorning the interior, and the cab veered dangerously to the right.
