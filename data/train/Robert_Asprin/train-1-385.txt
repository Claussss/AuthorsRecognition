"And I don't need the stele, only a chance to look at it. And, ah, Samlor-?" The caravan master nodded curtly to indicate that he would not take offense at what he assumed would be a tense question. "I will pay him well for the look," the Napatan said. "It's of no value to him-not for the purpose I intend it-without other information. It will give me the location of a particular tomb, which is significant to me for other reasons."
