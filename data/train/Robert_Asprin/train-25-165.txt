Shit! So close! So damn close! For a moment, Fred was filled with an urge to stand up and kick the unconscious mugger. You son-of-a-bitch! You've ruined everything! He was still swearing to himself two and a half hours later when he left the police station. It had taken him almost half an hour to flag down a cop, a glowing testimonial to police efficiency. Now the body had been carted away, the mugger was safely locked up, and Fred was left with nothing.
