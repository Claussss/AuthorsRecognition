   Tanda came in behind me, holding the torch up so that we      could both see what was ahead.    I froze like a statue at what I saw.    "Well I'll be a grave-digger's monkey," Tanda said.    Ahead of us wasn't another passageway, but a massive, low-ceilinged room. Rows and rows and rows of shelves lined the walls, and down the middle of the room, side-by-side, packed close on every inch of every shelf, were skulls.
