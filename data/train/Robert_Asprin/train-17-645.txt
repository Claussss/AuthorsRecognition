The moon was back. It was not in line with the window, but it was up there and a little light sneaked in to aid a thief. He found a wall, a jamb. Squatted, then went lower, wincing at rearward pain, to ensure that no light  showed under the door.  The latch was a  simple press-down hook.  He took  his time  depressing it.  He took  more time  in slowly,  slowly pulling open the door. It revealed a corridor or short hall.
