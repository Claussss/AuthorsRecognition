   "I see. I don't suppose you bothered to run a check on the credit card number that accompanied the reservation?"    "That is correct. As I said, the cost would be prohibitive."    Phule made a magician's pass with his hand and dropped his credit card on the desk in front of the manager.    "I think that should settle the question of prohibitive cost." To Bombest's credit, he neither gaped nor cringed at the sight of the card, but rather made a show of turning it over to examine the signature on the back. It was a Dilithium Express card, reserved for the ultra-rich in the galaxy and normally only used to expedite the buying and selling of companies. Despite his outward calm, the manager began to experience a vague niggle of fear that he had bitten off more than he could chew.
