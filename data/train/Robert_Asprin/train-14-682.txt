   "Allez! Fence!"    The progress of the bout was relentless, giving O'Donnel little or no time to regroup mentally.    Jester stamped his foot noisily, and the major had to fight to keep from twitching defensively at the sound.    Don't fall for a sound feint! It's just the kind of thing this joker will use to...    The Legionnaire surged forward, catching and controlling O'Donnel's sword with his own weapon, moving the deadly defending point to one side with a flick of his wrist while slamming his own point squarely into his opponent's mask.
