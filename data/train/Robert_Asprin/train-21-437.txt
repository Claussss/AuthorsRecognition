I was considering this possibility as I wandered across the palace courtyard, when a voice interrupted my thoughts. "Hey, Partner!" I had to look around for a moment before I spotted Aahz waving at me from one of the palace's upper windows. "Where were you this morning? We missed you at the session with Grimble." "I had to talk to Chumley," I called back. "Guido got hurt, and I had to ask Chumley to stand in for him."
