   "... And it's my job as your apprentice to tag along and back your moves. By your own logic, Chief, I'm obligated to you the same way you're obligated to Aahz." It was a good argument, and for a moment I was tempted to let her stay.    "Sorry, Massha," I said finally with real regret, "I can't let you do it."    "But..."    "... Because you're going to be my stand-in when the rest of the team takes on Queen Hemlock." That stopped her, as I thought it would, and she bit her lip and stared into the distance as I continued.  "It's bad enough that the rest of the crew is going to fight my battle for me, but to have both of us sit it out is unthinkable. They're going to need all the help they can get. Besides, part of the reason for having an apprentice is so that I can be two places at once... isn't it?" I figured that would end the discussion, but I underestimated Massha's determination.
