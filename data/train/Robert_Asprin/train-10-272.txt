   The cabin was warm and comfortable, just like the last time I had seen it.    Tananda and Aahz were sitting at the table, eating what smelled like beef stew with slices of homemade bread.    "Nice entrance," Tanda said, smiling at me. "What took you so long?"    Aahz just shook his head.    "Shut the door, would you?"    I stood there with the rock in the air over my head, not really believing what I was seeing. I had so convinced myself that Aahz and Tanda were in trouble that I couldn't believe that they were simply having lunch and waiting for me. Why had they let me stay the entire day and night in Kowtow?
