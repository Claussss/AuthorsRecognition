"Is there anything I can do to help?" I said, genuinely concerned. "No thanks," she smiled. "I was pretty much done when you knocked. Maybe sometime you can come in and spot for me, though." Now she had lost me completely. Spot what? And how would spotting anything help her work things out? "So what's up?" she said, perching on the edge of her bed. Whatever her problems were, they didn't seem to have her particularly upset. I decided to hold off on trying to sort them out, at least, until I had settled what I came here to do.
