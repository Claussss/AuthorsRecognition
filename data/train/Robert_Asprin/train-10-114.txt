   Tanda laughed.  "Don't we wish."    "When a person is dimension-hopping," Aahz said, "and      they have powers to do it, like Tanda does, you get a sense of      how many dimensions away you have jumped.  Not precise,      but just a sense of distance."    Tanda nodded. "And the farther away in number of dimensions, the harder the jump. And the greater the chance of missing the target and getting lost."
