of Odours. Walking around two sides of the Serpentine! She was stupid. The  dolt had no business whatever with that fine bracelet. Didn't have proper respect for it. Didn't know how to take care  of it. The moment she rounded the  corner, the thief stepped off the boardwalk onto  the unpaved street, squatted to snatch  up his    shoes    the   moment    he    stepped   out    of    them,   and    ran.
