   As always, thank you for your loyalty and patience.    Robert Lynn Asprin      February 2001 Chapter One       "Here we go again!"     When my teacher/mentor Aahz grumbles or rants about my being stupid or having done something stupid, I make a big show of being apologetic, but it really doesn't bother me all that much. I figure it goes with the territory and is part of the price of learning magik.
