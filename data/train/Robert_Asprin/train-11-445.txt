   "Gus!" Big Julie roared. "I thought I recognized your voice."    "Hi, Julie!" the gargoyle waved. "How's retirement?"    "Pretty dull. Hey, help yourself to some wine!"    "Thanks."    Gus stepped forward and took the two pitchers of wine from the general's nerveless grip, passing one to Chumly. It occurred to me that I was the only one of the crew who wasn't getting a drink out of this.    The general was transfixed, his eyes darting from gargoyle to troll and back again. He had paled slightly, but to his credit he hadn't given ground an inch.
