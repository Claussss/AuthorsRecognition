The door behind him opened and a young Japanese girl glided into the room. She was clad in traditional Japanese robes and was bearing a small tray of lacquered bamboo. She approached him softly and stood waiting until he noticed her presence. "Thanks, Yamiko," he said, taking his fresh drink from her tray. She gave a short bow and remained in place, looking at him. He tasted his drink, then realized she was still there.
