    no sense.    About halfway through the morning, still a long distance      from Donner, we came on a small town. It couldn't have been      half the size of Evade, and not more than a dot on the map.      The juice I had drunk in the middle of the night had long ago      worn off and I was so tired that I was just about falling down.    As I had hoped when I saw the little town, right in the middle was a place that looked a lot like Audry's. It was empty and we went in, taking what I was starting to think of as our normal table. I slouched in a chair in front of the window, glad to still be alive.
