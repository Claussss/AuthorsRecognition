   "Have you figured out yet what's going on?" she asked.    "Murppg!" I replied through a mouthful of food.    "Hmmm?" she frowned.    "I can't tell for sure," I said, swallowing hard. "Everybody's happy because they won something, but darned if I can hear what they won."    "Well," Tananda shrugged. "I warned you they were weird."    Just then the clamor in the streets soared to new heights, drowning out any efforts at individual conversation. Craning our necks in an effort to locate the source of the disturbance, we beheld a strange phenomenon. A wall-to-wall mob of people was marching down the street, chanting in unison and sweeping along, or trampling, any smaller groups it encountered. Rather than expressing anger or resentment at this intrusion, the people around us were jumping up and down and cheering, hugging each other with tears of pure joy in their eyes. The focus of everyone's attention seemed to be sitting on a litter borne aloft by the stalwarts at the head of the crowd. I was fortunate enough to get a look at it as it passed by-fortunate in that I could see it without having to move. The crowds were such that I couldn't move if I'd wanted to, so it was just as well that it passed close by.
