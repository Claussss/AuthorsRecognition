  Needing all the help I could get, I had Badaxe send one of his men for Big Julie. With minimal difficulty we smuggled him into the palace, and the three of us held a war council. On Badaxe's advice, I immediately dropped my disguise and brought our guest up to date on the situation.   "I'm sorry," Julie said to open the meeting, "but I don't see where I can help you, know what I mean?"   Terrific. So much for Big Julie's expert military advice.
