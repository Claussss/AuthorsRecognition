"What would prevent the Ants from evacuating the eggs through one of the tunnels?" asked Kah-Tu. "We could collapse the connecting tunnels with Surface Thumpers," replied Zur. "How could the water dart determine the precise spot to apply its rays?" commented Tur-Kam. "The chamber is of sufficient size, the precise spot would not be important," Zur countered. "I have to disagree," Heem injected. "In the campaign against the Aquatics, we discovered the cold-beam's effectiveness is severely restricted by water. In fact, it is doubtful that even with a precise target the beam would be able to break the chamber."
