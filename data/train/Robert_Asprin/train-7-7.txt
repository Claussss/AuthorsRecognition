   That brought the Deveel's attention back to me, and he extended a hand across the desk.    "So you're the Great Skeeve, eh? Pleased to meet you. Been hearing some good things about your work. Say, you really got a great setup. I especially like that little number you got working as a receptionist. Might even try to hire her away from you. The girl's obviously loaded with talent."    Looking at his leer and wink, I somehow couldn't bring myself to shake his hand.
