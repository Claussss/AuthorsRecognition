I banked the flyer into another turn and started back through my sextant, alert for any sign of a cave such as we were seeking. In another few sweeps I would have to break off the search and try another plan. If we flew too far apart, we would be unable to contact each other telepathically. "Commander I have a cave." "Message confirmed, Ssah. Is it large enough to get our flyers into?" "I have already flown in and back out again successfully. It will suit our purposes."
