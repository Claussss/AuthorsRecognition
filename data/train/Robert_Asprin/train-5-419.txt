   Finally the Kid grinned.    "I see. You eat my luck, eh? Good. Very good. You'll find, though, that it takes more than that to disturb my game."    His tone was jovial, but his eyes darkened even more than they had been and his shuffling took on a sharper, more vengeful tone. I knew I has scored a hit.    I stole a glance at Aahz, who winked at me broadly.    The deck was in front of me. Moving with forced nonchalance, I cut the deck roughly in half, then leaned back in my chair. While I tried to appear casual, inside I was crossing my fingers and toes and everything else crossable. I had devised my strategy on my own and hadn't discussed it with anyone ... not even Aahz. Now we got to see how it worked.
