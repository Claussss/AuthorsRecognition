   "Good evening. Captain Jester."    The Legionnaire commander turned and smiled vaguely at being addressed by name.    "Good evening," he said with reflexive politeness.    "I was wondering if I might buy you a drink?" the woman continued.    The Legionnaire smiled. "Thank you, but I'm on duty."    "I see. I thought you might be able to make an exception this time. My name is Maxine Pruet."    As expected, that caught Phule's entire attention, though he made a deliberate effort to remain outwardly casual.
