The tubelike barrel, which was pointing at the thugs, appeared to be a good inch in diameter, though they knew from experience that the muzzle of a weapon always looks bigger when it's pointed at you.

It is magazine-loaded, however, which enables me to change the loads depending on the situation at hand."
