Strick nodded. "Wintsenay suggested that you come?" "I don't want to get him in no trouble ner nothing, Spellmaster. We was talking, an' he sort of did, just sort of." "Urn." The spellwright's expression did not change, which took effort. "Uh, well, anyhow, uh-what do I owe you, Spellmaster?" Strick showed his visitor a very small smile and a small shake of the big head that was covered to midforehead, midcheek on each side, and the base of his nape by the snug cap of leather dyed dark blue. No one had seen this man's bare head, or a sign of hair. They saw the cap, and the strangeness of deep blue tunic over matching leggings. Strange, and dull. The medallion, a plugged gold piece he always wore, did little to alleviate the severity of his attire. Oddly, the medallion nearly matched his large and droopy mustache.
