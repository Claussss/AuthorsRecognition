   I'd make that decision if Aahz and Tanda didn't come back, Right      now I just needed to make sure Aahz and Tanda could find      me when they did get here. This little town was where they had left me; this was where I was going to stay. At least for the immediate future, however long that might be. If Glenda had managed to do something awful to Aahz and Tanda, I would face that problem later. Much later. And somehow make sure Glenda paid for her sins.
