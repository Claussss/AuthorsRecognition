   Sushi was wearing a set of headphones and carefully adjusting dials on his device when Do-Wop walked in.    "Hey, man, what's up?" said Do-Wop. "We figured out what Qual and his homeboys are talking about yet?"    "Shh," said Sushi, pointing to the device. "I've finally got them pretty well tuned in. And I've learned one thing already. Qual was right-they all speak slightly different versions of their language."
