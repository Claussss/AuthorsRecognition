   That hadn't been what I had hoped he'd say, but as I've noted before, there's no point in paying for guidance and then not following it.    "Okay. I'll go along with that. Any particular reason, though?"    "Sure. First of all, there are a lot of people in the magik business around here. We got schools, consultants, co-ops, entertainers, weather control and home defense outfits...  all sorts. What's more, they're spread out all over. We could spend the next year trying to check them out and still have barely scratched the surface. There aren't nearly as many financiers, on the other hand, so if they're on your list I figured we could start with them. Maybe we'll get lucky and not have to deal with the magik types."
