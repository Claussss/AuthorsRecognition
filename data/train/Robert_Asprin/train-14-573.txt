   "Well, sir... the company is unhappy with the uniforms you've provided them with."    "I see. Which uniform specifically?"    "All of them, sir. We feel they lack color."    "Color?"

While it may be unimaginative, I don't see any reason to change that, even if we could get approval from Headquarters... which I doubt."
