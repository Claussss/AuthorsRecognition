   Personally, I wasn't sure we could use Bee if he did show up, as the M.Y.T.H. Inc. operation is service-oriented and therefore doesn't have any warehouses, but I kept this thought to myself.    "Gee, thanks guys," Bee sez, biinkin' a bit more than usual. "Well ... see you around, I guess."    "You guys take care of yourselves ... you hear?" Spyder sez, standin' on her tiptoes to give each of us a big hug.
