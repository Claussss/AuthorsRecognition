   Finally we were herded into a big room with stone walls      and left, a golden-barred door slamming closed behind us. There were five others in the big room, all looking tattered      and exhausted. Ten beds were spaced around the walls and      all the previous prisoners were lying on the beds, sleeping.    "Glenda," Aahz said.    It took me a second to recognize the figure on the bed across the room. It was Glenda all right, but not the alive, beautiful, and powerful woman I had remembered from just a few days before. This woman wore tattered clothing, had dirt and deep circles under her eyes, and a huge red mark on her neck.
