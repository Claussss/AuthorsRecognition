Chapter Five:    "I just need to pick up a few things."    â€”I. MARCOS    I'VE MADE NUMEROUS references to the Bazaar at Deva, where I make my home. For the benefit of those who do not travel the dimensions or read these books, it's the largest market center in the known dimensions.

Competition is stiff, and the Deveel merchants will turn themselves or their customers inside out before they'll let a sale get away.
