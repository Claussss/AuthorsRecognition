(Send to  me that  detailed list  of all  the characters  in all the books, with however brief ID  for each-and whether  still alive, KlA-and-dead,  or Undead. I like to  remember and  include all  those little  people, such  as Thumpfoot and Mungo and Shive  the Changer and  Frax, former Palace  night-sentinel who's been out of  work since  the arrival  of the  Beysibs, and  Weasel, and ... you know.
