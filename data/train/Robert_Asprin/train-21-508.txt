At that moment, I felt my pet stir in my arms, weakly trying to raise his head. "Take it easy, fellah," I said, trying to sound soothing. Gleep's eyes found mine. "Skeeve?" he said faintly, then went limp, his head falling back on my lap. He had said my name! The first thing he had ever said other than the sound that had given him his name. I carefully eased his head onto the ground and rose. I stood looking down at him for several moments, then raised my eyes to the surrounding crowd. I don't know what my expression was, but they all gave ground several steps as my gaze passed over them.
