   Tanda just nodded.    I didn't like that at all. Disappearing was not something      I considered in my possible future. I had plans. Better, big     ger plans. Yet now I was risking my life chasing a cow. Not      smart at all as far as I was concerned. I tried to think about      something else besides a future where someone made me      vanish.    "How do the Shifters keep changing like that one did?"
