      "Things are looking up."      MICHELANGELO    The rest of the night just crawled past. Aahz and Tanda stayed on the couches with me for the longest time, studying the map and trying to figure out how we were going to get out of here.      I noticed that, once Aahz discovered there was no golden cow,      and that the map had been a sham to get someone to save Harold, he became very interested in just leaving. I supposed that was better late then never.
