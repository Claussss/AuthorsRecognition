   The bushes off to our left parted, and the dragon's head emerged.    "Gleep?" he said, cocking his head.    " Come here!" I repeated.    My pet needed no more encouragement. He bounded into the open and trotted to my side.    "I still say we should have left that stupid dragon back at the inn," Aahz grumbled.    I ignored him, checking to be sure that the gear hung saddlebag fashion over the dragon's back was still secure. Personally, I felt we were carrying far too much in the way of personal belongings, but Aahz had insisted. Gleep tried to nuzzle me affectionately with his head, and I caught a whiff of his breath. For a moment, I wondered if Aahz had been right about leaving the dragon behind.
