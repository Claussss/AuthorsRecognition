She dropped back into her seat, and Tambu winced as the room stared at the viewscreen, waiting for his answer. "Thank you, A.C.," he said slowly. "And I really mean that. All I can say is that you're absolutely right." The captains shifted uneasily and muttered to each other as he continued. "There are two points of clarification before I share my thoughts with you. First, though I was manipulating the discussion, I was not being close-minded. If a point had been raised from the floor that had escaped my earlier studies on the situation, I would have given it my full consideration. Second, knowing my decision would be unpopular and therefore require considerable explanation, I was trying to bundle that explanation in a choreographed discussion rather than simply lecturing and dictating. Now, I can only apologize to the captains. Whatever my intentions, my methods in dealing with you were less than honest, and therefore in clear violation of my own principles and the spirit of these meetings. I'm sorry. It won't happen again."
