   I let the disguise spell drop, leaving the policemen in the lineup to glare suspiciously at each other as well as at me.  "What point is that?"    "That this whole lineup thing is silly. We'll ignore the bit with putting all of your colleagues up here with me for the moment and assume you were playing it straight. My point is that I'm not the only one who knows how to use a disguise spell. Anyone who's laid eyes on me or seen a picture of me could use a disguise spell well enough to fool the average witness. That invalidates the lineup identification as evidence. All you've established is that someone with access to my image has been seen by the witness...  not that I personally, was anywhere near him." There was a long silence beyond the lights.
