There was a crackling in the brush to our left, interrupting our conversation.    "Boss?" came Brockhurst's soft hail. "Are you busy?"    "Sort of," I called back.    "Well, this will only take a minute."    Before I could reply, two shadows detached themselves from the brush and drew closer. One was Brockhurst, the other was Gus. I should have known from the noise that the gargoyle was accompanying Brockhurst. Like Tanda, the Imp could move like a ghost.
