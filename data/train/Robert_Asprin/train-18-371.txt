the gods chose-But gods had self-interest right along with the rest of creation; gods might trick a man-might trick an empire, play games with souls, with a  man who served their cause. Tempus could be  wrong. Gods know  he could be  wrong. He doesn't  care for this town. I do. I can give it to him. Is that treason? An empire runs on what works, doesn't it? I've just got to live to get it  working. Prove it to Crit. Prove it to  Tempus.
