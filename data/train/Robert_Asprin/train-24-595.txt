"But why would you want a pommel that looks like the head of an Ant?" "It...it gives me pleasure to look at it, Commander." I was beginning to think there was something significant indicated here. Perhaps a recurrence of the inactive time problem I had experienced on my last mission. "Where did you obtain this weapon, Warrior?" "From the Technicians, Commander, like any other weapon. I'm sure if the Commander is interested, one would be available for him, too. I notice several of his staff already have them."
