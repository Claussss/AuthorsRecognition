"Why didn't you come back?"    "We couldn't," Tanda said, patting me on the back and leading me to the table, where she slid some bread toward me as I sat down.    I stared at my mentor, who was just eating and not paying      much attention to me at the moment. He did that when he was very angry or very happy, and at the moment I honestly didn't know which it was.
