"What makes you think the other captains know what their crews want?" "It's obvious. You can see it in their stance and hear it in their voices when they talk." "They don't know their crews any better than you do," Tambu declared harshly. "You're confusing good oratory with good leadership." Egor frowned, trying to grasp the concept as Tambu continued. "Look, Egor, a lot of those captains aren't as sensitive as you are. It never occurs to them that their crew might have opinions. They speak their own minds and assume their crews are in agreement with them. A lot more know their crews don't agree with them, but they don't care. They're the captains, and that's that."
