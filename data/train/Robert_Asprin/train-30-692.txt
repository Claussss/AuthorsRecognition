A beggar watched  the house, outside.  Was always there,  a huddle of  rags; and Mor-am had bad dreams, waked shrieking night after night. "Won't leam,"  he muttered,  and poured  himself more  wine with a knife-scarred hand that rattled the wine bottle against the cup rim. "Don't what?" He  set the bottle  down and picked  up the cup,  leaving beads of wine on the table surface, spilling more on the way to his mouth.
