Lieutenant Booth could scarcely contain his excitement as he waited for confirmation on the smoke flare coordinates. "I've got it, Lieutenant! Right on the button! They're clear!" "Open fire! Level the entire target area." The shells were hitting before he stopped talking as his mortar teams eagerly pumped round after round into the designated target area. At last! After six months-contact! He watched gleefully as explosion after explosion rocked the area. Luckily they picked up that transmission from B Company. The way the radios had been acting up they could have missed it completely. Probably some new jamming device the mercenaries were using. Well, it was nice to know they had trouble with their gear too.
