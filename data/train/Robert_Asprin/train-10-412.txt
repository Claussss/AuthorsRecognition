   "Easy there, big fella," Glenda said, her voice hoarse. "We're all in this together."    "I'm not in anything with you," Aahz said.    Looking at the wreck she had become, it was hard for me to even remember why I had been interested in her in the first      place. Could I be that superficial that she had to remain beau     tiful for me to care? Or did I no longer find her attractive or have any interest in her because she had betrayed us? It was an interesting question I'd have to talk to Aahz about once we were safely back home.
