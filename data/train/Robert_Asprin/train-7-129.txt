   "That's the trouble with folks today. Everybody's in such a hurry. Don't you agree, big fella?"    Again I found myself torn between entering a conversation with this likable chap and watching over little sister. As always, family loyalty won out.    "Ahh... Big Crunch in hurry too. Will talk with little man later."    "Sure. Anytime. I'm usually around."    He waved goodbye, and I waved back as I hurried after Tananda.
