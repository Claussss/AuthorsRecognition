Erickson refrained from comment. "So the Alliance's threat was felt from the first day on," he said instead. "You flatter the Alliance with your word choice. The Defense Alliance has never constituted a serious threat to my fleet-then or now." "But you just said they destroyed five of your ships!" "Five out of nearly two hundred," Tambu remarked pointedly. "I'll also admit they've downed several of our ships since-just as we've destroyed several of theirs. I tend to attribute their victories to shortcomings in my own captains rather to any brilliance or competence on their part."
