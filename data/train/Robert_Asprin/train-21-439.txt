"Hi, Grimble. Aahz said you wanted to see me?" The Chancellor glanced up to where I was leaning against the doorway. "Ah. Lord Skeeve," he nodded. "Yes. Come in. This shouldn't take long." I eased into the room and plopped down in the offered chair. "What's the problem? Aahz said something about eagles?" "Eagles? I wonder what he was referring to. No, there's no problem," Grimble said. "If anything, quite the contrary. In fact, the new tax collection process is working well enough that we're now in a positive cash flow situation. What's more, I think that except for dotting a few I's and crossing a few T's we've got the new budget pretty well nailed down."
