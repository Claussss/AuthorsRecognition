   The stone was highly polished and there looked to be gold lining the top.    The guy in charge pointed us at the gate, but didn't follow      us in. Instead, five other men in white robes with gold trim met us just inside the gate and indicated we should follow. Each carried a golden shovel like a cane, using it to walk. It was clear that a person who worked outside the palace and didn't have a golden shovel couldn't get into the palace. Why were we so lucky?
