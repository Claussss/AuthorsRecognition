one eye had a cataract, and the  other was beginning to lose its sight  for some unknown reason. Along the adobe wall was a brass charcoal brazier and above it a wooden vent.  A bin held charcoal. A  big cabinet beside it  held grain and some  dried meat and plates and knives. Near  it was a baked  clay vase for water.  Next to it was  a pile of cloths. Wallu pointed at the  curtain in the doorway to the other  room.
