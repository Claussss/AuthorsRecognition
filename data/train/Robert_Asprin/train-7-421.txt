Apparently he feels that without his powers he's deadwood... taking up space without earning his pay. He's packed up and gone, headed back to Perv."    I dropped the paper back on my desk.    "That's why I'm not going after Queen Hemlock myself. I'm going to Perv... after Aahz."    The room exploded.
