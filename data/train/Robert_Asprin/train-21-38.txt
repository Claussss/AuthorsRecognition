"Well, you know how you've been saying that Gleep has been acting strange lately?" "Yeah. So?" he said, his squeaky voice taking on a cautious note. "I want you to try to spend more time with him. Talk to him ... maybe take him out for some exercise." "Me, Boss?" "Sure. You get along with him better than anyone ... except, maybe, me ... and I'm going to be tied up with the kingdom's finances for a while. If there's anything wrong with Gleep, I want to find out about it before anyone else gets hurt."
