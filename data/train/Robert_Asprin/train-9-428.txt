   I should have been despairing as I wrote out the checks for my driver and bodyguard in preparation for our parting, but I wasn't.  Instead, I found myself thinking about the Duchess.  My first reaction to her was that she was a crazy old lady trying to live in the past by maintaining an illusion of wealth that nobody believed except her. Ideally, someone who cared should give her a stem talking to and try to bring her back into contact with reality so she could start adjusting to what was instead of what had been or should be. I guess, on reflection, I found her situation to be more sad than irritating or contemptible.
