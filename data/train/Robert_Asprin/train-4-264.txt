  "Okay, Aahz. As soon as I...."   Yep. Aahz was back.   "Um, if you'll excuse us, folks, Aahz and I have to..."   For the second time, there was a BAMPH in the room.   This one was louder, which was understandable, as there were more beings involved. Specifically, there were now four Deveels standing in the room... and they didn't look happy.   "We seek the Great Skeeve," one of them boomed.   My heart sank. Could my involvement with the Mob have been discovered so fast?
