   "That's it," I said, fighting to keep my voice calm. "Now.. ."    "Daddy! Guido says..."    "Ssshh!!!" I hissed. "Not now, Markie! We're trying to light the candle."    She paused in the doorway and cocked her head quizzically.    "Oh, that's easy!" she beamed suddenly and raised her head.    "MARKIE!! DON'T..."    But I was too late.    There was a sudden flash of light in the room, and the candle lit. Well, it didn't exactly light, it melted like a bag of water when you take away the bag. So did the candle holder. The table lit, though... briefly. At least one comer of it did. It flared for a moment, then the fire died as abruptly as it had appeared. What was left was a charred quarter-circle of tabletop where the corner used to be. That and a table leg standing alone like a burnt out torch. The fire had hit so fast and smooth the leg didn't even topple over.
