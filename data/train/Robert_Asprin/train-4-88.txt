  I shook my head.   "Right idea, but wrong order. I wasn't going to bribe you with an apprenticeship, Massha. I told you before I don't know much magik, but what I know I'll be glad to teach you . .. whether you find the King or not. I'm not sure that's an apprenticeship, but it's yours if you want it."   She smiled, a smile quite different from her usual vamp act.   "We'll argue about it later. Right now, I've got a king to find."
