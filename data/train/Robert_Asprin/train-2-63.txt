you sure you're Garkin's apprentice? I mean, he hasn't told you anything at all about dimensions?"             "No," I answered. "I mean, yes, I'm his apprentice, but he never said anything about the demon-suns."             "That's dimensions," he corrected. "Well, a dimension is another world, actually one of several worlds, existing simultaneously with this one, but on different planes. Follow me?"
