   Long years of experience had taught me not to expect Aahz to share a pitcher of wine. One was barely enough for him.    "Sure. I got lots. Badaxe is inside now getting some."    "Badaxe?" Aahz frowned. "What's he doing here?"    "At the moment, wondering what you're doing here," came a booming voice.    We all turned to find the shaggy-mountain form of Possiltum's general framed in the doorway of the cottage, a pitcher of wine balanced in each hand. Hugh Badaxe always seemed to me to be more beast than man, though I'll admit his curly dark hair and beard when viewed in conjunction with his favorite animal skin cloak contributed greatly to the image. Of course, beasts didn't use tools, while Badaxe definitely did. A massive double-edged axe dangled constantly from his belt, at once his namesake and his favorite tool of diplomacy.
