   The crowd edged back nervously. From the corner of my eye, I saw the general's hand slide to the handle of his axe.    "But it is within my power! Now you know that the forces of darkness are no strangers to Skeeve!"    I spun and stabbed a finger at Aahz.    "Bobbelty gook, crumbs and martyrs!"    I removed Aahz's disguise.    There was a moment of stunned silence, then Aahz smiled. Aahz's smile has been known to make strong men weak, and there were not many strong men in the crowd.
