problem at our end. For years we have tried to answer each letter  individually, and as a result have countless sacks and drawers of unanswered mail. We've  read it all,  but replying  is biting  heavily into  our writing  (for pay)  time. In desperation, we are  converting to a  word processor and  a computerized mailing list, and armed with the weapons of modem technology we will tackle the backlog.
