            The sight of the two weapons had rattled me so badly I almost missed my cue. Fortunately, I managed to gather my scattered senses and closed my eyes, shakily executing the change features spell to convert Aahz back to his normal dubious appearance.             I'm not sure what reaction I had expected from the Imps at the transformation, but the one I got surpassed any possible expectations.
