   "Oh, right. The personal ads. Sorry, I'm still waking up.  Sounds like a good idea," I said, rummaging around for some loose change. "How much does it cost?" To my surprise, the bellhop held up a restraining hand., "I'll go the cost on my own if you don't mind, Mr.  Skeeve."    "Sure. That way, if it works, there won't be any doubt who gets that reward you mentioned."    With that, he flashed me a quick grin and left. It occurred to me that I should start watching my spending to be sure I'd have enough to actually pay a reward if the bellhop or one of his friends managed to locate Aahz for me.
