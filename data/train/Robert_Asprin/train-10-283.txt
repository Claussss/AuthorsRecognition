   Tanda shook her head. "I think that's where Glenda got      me. She blocked my sense of dimensions when we got near      her. When we jumped back here from Kowtow, into the storm,      I could sense Vortex #4 and Vortex #2. We can get home      any time we want."    My relief at that, combined with my relief at finding Aahz and Tanda all right, was more than I could handle. I stared at my stew, trying to make myself eat as much of it as I could. Doing anything else and I just might fall apart completely.
