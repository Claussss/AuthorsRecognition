   The crowd was on its feet, screaming incoherently. If they didn't like that, they didn't really get upset over our next move.    "Everybody, mount up!" I shouted.    On cue, Tananda jumped on Chumly's back and Badaxe did the same with Gus. I levitated half the ball to each twosome, then did a fast disguise spell.    What our opponents saw now was three images of me astride three images of Gleep. Each image of me had half a ball proudly in its possession.
