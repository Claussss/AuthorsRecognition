   Regardless of what my mentor may think, I'm not slow. I realized in a flash the implications of what he was saying... realized them and formulated an answer.    "So we suddenly get a lot of strange people dropping in on us to offer jobs, or looking for work," I acknowledged. "So what? All that means is I get a lot of practice saying â€˜No.' Who knows, it might improve my status around here a little if it's known that I regularly consult with strange beings from other worlds."
