   "Hey. Don't mention it. What are friends for? Whoops! Here comes Tananda!"    The other disadvantage to holing up at the Yellow Crescent Inn, besides the fact that it isn't a bar, is that it's located right across the street from my home. This is not good for someone who's trying to avoid his housemates.    Fortunately, this was one situation I could handle with relative ease.    "Don't tell her I'm here, Gus," I instructed.
