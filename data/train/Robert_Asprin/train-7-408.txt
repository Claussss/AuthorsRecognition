   My own view of the pending session was a mixture of dread and impatience. Impatience finally dominated, and I called the meeting to order.    "I know you all came prepared to discuss the sale of The Fun House," I said, looking around at the team members sprawled hither and yon, "but something has come up that I think takes priority over that. If no one objects, I'll temporarily table the casino discussion in favor of new business."
