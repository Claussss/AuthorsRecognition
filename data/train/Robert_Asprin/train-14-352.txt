   The company was hanging on his words, caught up in his certainty and wanting him to be right.    "Let's get down to some specifics here and see how this works. The three-meter wall is a problem."    He pointed at the offending obstacle, and the Legionnaires nodded, a few grimacing wryly.    "It's obvious just from looking at it that if you've got the height and the strength, you can go over it. But if you don't, you're stuck. That may be true for a pack of individuals, but we're not. We're a team, and we don't leave teammates behind or let them get stuck just because they aren't tall. Forget getting you over it and start thinking about getting us over it. If someone was to get on top and stay there to give a hand up to those coming after him, everyone could get over a lot easier. Better still, if some of you heavyweights were to make a staircase with your shoulders, we could go over this thing without breaking stride. Again, the idea is to maximize what you can do, not to let yourself get defeated by what you can't do."
