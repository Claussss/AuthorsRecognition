"Do you have any way of communicating with the boarding party?" Tambu asked. "Just a second-I'll check." There was a brief silence, then Egor spoke again. "They're using hand communicators, same as us. They're on a different frequency though. I can hold mine next to theirs if you want to talk to them direct." "Just relay this message to their captain. Tell him to take their shuttle to our ship-alone. I want to talk to him. Let me know when you get confirmation."
