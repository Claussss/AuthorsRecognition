   "Gleep!"    I started to automatically cuff the dragon away, then had a sudden change of heart.    "Hi, fella," I smiled, scratching his ear. "Lonely?"    In response, my pet flopped on his side with a thud that shook the ground. His serpentine neck was long enough that he managed to perform this maneuver without moving his head from my grasp.    His loyal affection brought a smile to my face for the first time since I had taken up my lonely vigil. It was a welcome antidote to my nervous insomnia.
