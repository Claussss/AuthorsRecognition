   I tried to think of a tactful way of saying that this still looked pretty bottom of the barrel to me.  "... So you think this is better than working at an entry-level job for someone else?"    His head came up proudly.    "I didn't say that. I don't figure to be doing this forever.  This is just a way to raise the capital to start a bigger business. I'm risking it all on my own abilities. If it works, I get all the profits instead of a wage and I can move on to better things. What's more, if it works well enough, I've got more to pass on to my kids than my parents did. If it doesn't... well, I'm no worse off than when I started."
