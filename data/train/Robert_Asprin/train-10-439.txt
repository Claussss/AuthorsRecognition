   Without waiting for another idea from my mentor, I started      up. The hole in the roof of the tunnel was big enough that my shoulders touched on both sides, but not so small that I had to squeeze. Aahz might be able to make it, but it was going to take some work.    Once I got through the hole, the space got bigger. I stopped      and Aahz handed me the torch, passing it up past me quickly so I wouldn't get burned.
