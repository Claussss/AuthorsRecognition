   After what Glenda had done to us, I figured it would have served her right to become a cow for most of every month for      the rest of her life. She was already a self-centered bloodsucker;      why shouldn't she have the entire cow package?    After Aahz pulled the rope off of her, she awoke, groaned      and somehow managed to sit up, her face pale and her eyes      glazed. "What happened?"    "You slept through the night just fine," Aahz said.
