   I knew a cue when I heard one. I drooled and bared my teeth at the messenger.    The man shot a horrified look in my direction. "Actually," he said hastily, "I really must be going. I'll tell His Majesty you'll be following close behind."    "You're sure you wouldn't like to stay?" Aahz asked hopefully.    "Positive!" The man nearly shouted his reply as he began backing the bird away from us.    "Oh, well," Aahz said. "Perhaps we'll catch up with you on the road."
