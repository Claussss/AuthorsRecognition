  "Yes, tomorrow ... when your bride arrives."   Suddenly I was no longer tired. Not a bit. I was wide awake and listening with every pore.   "My bride?" I asked cautiously.   "Surely your Majesty hasn't forgotten. She specifically scheduled her arrival so that she would have a week to prepare for your wedding."   Case load be hanged. Now I knew why dear Rodrick wanted a vacation. I also knew, with cold certainty, that he wouldn't be back tonight to relieve me of my duties. Not tonight, and maybe not ever.
