Chapter Seven:    "There's a time to fight, and a time to hide out!"    -B. CASSIDY    I'VE heard that when some people get depressed, they retire to their neighborhood bar and tell their troubles to a sympathetic bartender. The problem with the Bazaar at Deva (a problem I had never noticed before) is that there are no sympathetic bartenders!    Consequently, I had to settle for the next best thing and holed up in the Yellow Crescent Inn.
