   nondescript tent at the Bazaar at Deva with my break-    fast under my arm ... guilty, but smug.   "Excuse me, young sahr!"   I turned to find an elderly Deveel waving desperately    at me as he hurried forward. Normally I would have    avoided the encounter, as Deveels are always selling    something and at the moment I wasn't buying, but since    I wasn't in a hurry I decided to hear what he had to say.
