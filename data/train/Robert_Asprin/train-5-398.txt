   The assemblage melted away before us, clearing a path to the door. I began to recognize faces in the crowd, people I knew. There was Gus waving enthusiastically at me, and over there...    I veered from our straight line and the whole procession ground to a halt.    "Hi, Skeeve!" the vampire smiled, clapping me on the shoulder. "Good luck tonight!"    "I'm going to need it!" I confided. "Seriously, though, I've been meaning to stop by and thank you for your warning about the Ax."
