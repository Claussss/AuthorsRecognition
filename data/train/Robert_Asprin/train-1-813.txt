"All right, you damn' cat, let's go home and drop off my new pot of glue! You'll need to sniff out the place anyhow." Notable swerved sharply to bang his flank into Hanse's leg. "Maowr!" "No, damn it. Notable, we will not stop and get you a beer now!" Strick's rule was that people came to him; he went to no one. For this interview he had long wanted, however, he would have gone to the pal- ace. Prince-Governor Kadakithis would not hear of it. Instead, secretly, in disguise and terribly early on a Fourday morning as agreed for his convenience and security, he arrived in Strick's "shop." In this absolute privacy and confidence, the handsome young Rankan of about Hanse's age and size astonished Strick; he admitted that he was less than he wished to be and had decided that it was because he was too indecisive; fearful of what the Ilsigi would think of him.
