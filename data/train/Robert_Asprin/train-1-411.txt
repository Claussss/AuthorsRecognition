Left to his own devices-unwilling to consider what his niece was teaching herself now, and barely unwilling to order her to turn away- Samlor surveyed the houses in their immediate neighborhood. It was an old section of the city, but wealthy and fashionable enough that there had been considerable rebuilding to modify the original Ilsigi character. Directly across from Samlor's vantage place, the front of a house had been demolished and was being replaced by a two-story por- tico with columns of colored marble. A lamp burned brightly on a shack amid the construction rubble, and a watchman's eyes peered toward the trio from its unglazed window.
