"I thank you for your generous offer," Mariat replied just as sweetly, "but I really could not burden you with so weighty a responsibility on my account." She rose quickly, holding up her hand to stop any further objection.

Thank you, good sir. I look forward to seeing you and your friends tomorrow at the Warm Kettle."
