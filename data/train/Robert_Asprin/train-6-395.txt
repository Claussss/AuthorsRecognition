   I repeated the process, returning Aahz to his "dubious character" disguise.    "Well, we're off," Aahz waved. "Confusion to the enemy!"    Today's plan called for Gus substituting for me. The logic was that should anything go wrong, his stone flesh would not only keep him from harm, but also serve as a shield to defend Aahz.    Somehow it didn't seem right to me, to remain behind in relative safety while sending someone else to take my risks for me. It occurred to me that perhaps I had called the wrong person "coward" last night when speaking with Ajax.
