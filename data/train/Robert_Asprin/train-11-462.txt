   A moment later, we were back in Jahk. Chapter Twenty-Two:    "No matter what the game, no matter what the rules, the same rules apply to both sides!"    -HOYLE'SLAW    THE stadium had undergone two major changes since the last time Aahz and I were here.    First, the configuration of the field had been changed. Instead of a rectangle, the chalk lines now outlined a triangle with netted goals at each corner. I assumed that was to accommodate a three-way instead of a two-way match.
