   "You've seen this before," I said. "It's painted on the ceil     ing of the library in there."    "No, it's not," Harold said, shaking his head. "This is a picture of the castle during Count Bovine's first days."    "Go look for yourself," Tanda said. "It took me a while to      see it as well. Skeeve spotted it first."    Harold stared at us as if we had all gone nuts. I didn't blame him. If I had been living in a place for as many years as he had been trapped here, and a stranger had pointed something this important out, I wouldn't believe him either.
