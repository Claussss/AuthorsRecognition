   As he's sayin' this, he raises his hand to point in our direction.    Now there is a gag that Nunzio and I have pulled so often that we don't even have to look at each other now to know what to do. We are still holdin' Junebug up by his arms, and the cop is close enough that when he tries to point at us, it's an easy matter for us to move Junebug sideways in front of his hand ... then let go!    Unless you are watchin' real close at the right moment, this looks exactly like the cop took a poke at Junebug and decked him!
