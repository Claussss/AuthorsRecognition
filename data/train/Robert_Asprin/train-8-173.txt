   "If I may, sir," I heard Sergeant Smiley say, "I'd like to have a word outside with Sergeant Guido before he rejoins his unit."    I am half-expectin' Smiley to try to jump me, bad arm and all, once we get outside, or at least lay some heavy threats on me about what would happen the next time our paths cross. Instead, he is all grins and holds out his good hand for me to shake.    "Congratulations, Guido ... sorry, I mean Sergeant Guido," he sez. "There was one thing I wanted to say to you away from the other recruits."
