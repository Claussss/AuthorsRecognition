plain, a vista that stretched out gray to meet that nacreous sky. And there  was no sound. Not the faintest hum of a single lonely insect; not the merest peep of a nightbird or  the scuttle  of tiny  feet or  of fronds  whispering in  a night breeze. Here was no sun and yet no night, and no flora or fauna either. Here were only Hanse, armored and armed, and Mignureal, and here came  Vashanka, at the charge.
