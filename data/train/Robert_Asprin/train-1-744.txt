"My abilities don't extend to-to ... hmm. I'm not sure what it is you want of me, Abohorr." Strick's pronunciation of "want" rhymed with "font" or his extreme shortening of the o in "lost."

"I'd do anything for you, Spellmaster. I'll pay you for yer time, too, 'f I'm wasting it. Just-well, just let me know if you hear of anything; a job I might fill. I'm big, and strong, and a damned good worker, Spellmaster. I'm used to a lot of work. You've got a lot of contacts and everybody's talkin' about all the people you've helped, Spellmaster- If you hear of anything ... well, Wints-yer helper Wintsenay, I mean-knows where to find me."
