   Shortly thereafter, Don Bruce hired the Great Skeeve to oversee the Mob's interests on Deva, and assigned Nunzio and me to him as bodyguards ... which is when we started callin' him Boss.    With me so far?    Okay, now review the circumstantials with me again, and see if youse can understand the dilemma facin' us.    First of all, the Boss is working for the Mob.    Second, he has sent us to deal with the situation in Possiltum while he goes after Aahz.
