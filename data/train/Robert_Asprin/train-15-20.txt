He paused for a moment, then added, "I couldn't look myself in the mirror if I thought I was growing up."    "That's OK," said Sushi, grinning again. "Nobody else can stand to look at you, so there's no reason you should have to, either."    Do-Wop punched him on the biceps and said, "See? You just proved my point. So, don't you think we oughta go check out that new coaster?"
