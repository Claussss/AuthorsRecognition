   "I'll be fine," I said. "Just a little carrot juice and I can fly a long ways."    The silence in the cabin was intense.    I looked at Aahz, then at Tanda and smiled. "Just kid-ding."    For some reason, neither of them laughed.    Along the way there were more and more cattle, bigger herds than we had seen at any other place. I was just glad that none of them were lined up along the road watching us.
