"Push-ups," she said. "One hundred push-ups. That order was for you, too."    "Yes, Sergeant," said Rube. "We did one hundred push-ups. What should we do while the humans are finishing?"    "You did the hundred? That's impossible," said Brandy. She looked at her watch; it had been less than two minutes since she'd ordered the squad to do push-ups. Her frown got deeper. "You must be doing them wrong. Show me how you do push-ups."
