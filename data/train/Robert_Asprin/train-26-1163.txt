Zalbar took the offered seat absently, trying to organize his thoughts. "I had a friend ... he was killed several years ago. He's haunting me. The first time was a long time back and he didn't reappear, so I thought it was just a bad dream. Lately, he's been coming to me more often ... every time I try to  sleep, as a  matter of  fact. He  says he  needs my  help to  cross over, whatever that means. He told me to  talk to you ... that  you could tell me what  he couldn't.
