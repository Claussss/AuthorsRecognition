   Then, behind him, the wall fell down.    On the other side awaited the Omega Mob-over a hundred strong.    Phule stood at the head of the company. He pointed forward and shouted, "To the finish line! All together!"    The Omega Mob moved forward like a tidal wave. As they passed Qual and the Gambolts, they picked them up and carried them along with them, chairing them on the shoulders of their comrades, cheering as if they'd won a gravball championship. There were obstacles in their way, but it didn't matter. The Mob didn't slow until they'd reached the finish line, and behind them the course was flat as a pancake.
