   "I did?"    "Sure. Back in the alley. You used a spell to sober me up before I had to fight those goons. To my thinking, that fulfills your contract."    The Djin stroked his beard thoughtfully.    "I dunno," he said. "That wasn't much of a spell."    "You never promised much," I insisted. "As a matter of fact, you went to great lengths to impress me with how little you could do."    "Oh, that," Kalvin waved his hand deprecatingly.  "That's just the standard line of banter we feed to the customers. It keeps them from expecting too much of a Djin.  You'd be amazed at some of the things folks expect us to do. If we can keep their expectations low, then they're easier to impress when we strut our stuff."
