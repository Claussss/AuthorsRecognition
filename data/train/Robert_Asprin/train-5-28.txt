My stomach bottomed out.    "Geek, we were talking about a piece of paper. You know, â€˜IOU, etc.'? A marker! Who leaves a little girl for a marker?"    "Pidge does. Always has. C'mon, Skeeve. You know me. Would I give anyone credit for a piece of paper? I give Pidge credit on Markie here because I know he'll be back to reclaim her."
