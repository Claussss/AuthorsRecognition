   Baker looked to be about twice the size of Evade, and was spread out over more than just a Main Street. It was tucked into a small valley, with flat farmland going off in both directions from it.    We walked into town, following the road and staying off      the wooden sidewalks so that we wouldn't make any noise.      The town was just flat empty. Not even a horse had been left      outside.  Nothing was moving, and as far as we could tell, nothing lived here, even though we knew better.
