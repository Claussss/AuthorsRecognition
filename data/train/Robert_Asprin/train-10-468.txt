   "Wow," Tanda said, looking around at the gold-inlaid pan     els and golden ceilings of the massive ballroom.    The floor was a highly polished white stone with streaks of gold running through it. In my wildest imaginings I could have never come up with a ballroom as fancy or beautiful as      this one.    Aahz and Glenda stopped beside us in the huge room. I bet at least five hundred people could've danced in this room without even bumping into one another.
