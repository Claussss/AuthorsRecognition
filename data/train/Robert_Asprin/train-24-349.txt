I compared the display on her arm-unit with the display on the View Screen. She was right. The configuration of the formations had definitely changed. "Do you have similar data from the other two campaigns?" I asked. She cued an index list and studied it. "No data from the campaign against the Aquatics... They were concentrating on the bodies of water then...but...yes, here it is." She fed a cue into the arm-unit and extended again. "This is the same area during the campaign against the Wasps."
