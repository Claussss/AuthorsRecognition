   "Sergeant Escrima ... reporting for volunteering."    Phule's smile came easily as he returned the ramrod-stiff salute. He had a genuine fondness for the company's feisty little mess sergeant, though perhaps "feisty" was a poor description. Escrima was easily the deadliest fighter in the company, especially with sticks or any cut-and-thrust weapon.    "Stand easy, Sergeant," he said. "I'll admit I'm glad to see you volunteering. I rather hoped you would."
