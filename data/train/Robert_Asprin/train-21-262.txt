"Go away!" I called, not even bothering to try to make it sound polite. As soon as I uttered the words, however, I realized I would have been better off just staying quiet. Not only had the effort increased the pounding in my head, I had inadvertently let her know I was awake. As if in response to my afterthought, the door opened and Bunny came in, a big tray of food in her hands. "When I didn't see you at breakfast or at lunch, I figured you might be a little worse for wear from last night," she said crisply, setting the tray on my desk. "I had the kitchen put together a tray for you to help you back to the land of the living."
