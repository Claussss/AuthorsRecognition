I quickly filled them in on what Griffin had told me earlier. When I finished, the team was uncomfortably silent.    "Well," Aahz said at last, "things could be worse."    "How?" I asked bluntly.    "Gleep?" My dragon had just spotted something the rest of us had missed. The other teams were bringing their riding beasts onto the field. Unlike the players, the beasts weren't marked with the team colors... but then, it wasn't necessary. There was no way they could be confused with each other.
