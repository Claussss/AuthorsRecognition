   "What's wrong with Luanna?"    I shrugged and resumed our stroll, forcing Tananda to keep up.    "Oh, she's pretty enough, I suppose. But she's a smalltime swindler who's so shortsighted she'd sell him out at the first hint of trouble. In short, she'd be an anchor around his neck who would keep him from climbing and potentially drag him down. If we're going to fix the lad up with a swindler, she should at least be a big-league swindler... like, say, a certain someone we know who has the Mob for a dowry."
