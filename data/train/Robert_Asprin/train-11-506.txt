   The game was on, and all we were doing was standing around with our mouths open.    As usual, Aahz was the first to recover.    "Don't just stand there with your mouth open!" he shouted. "Go get the ball."    "But I..."    "GLEEP!"    What I had intended to point out to Aahz was that the cat was almost at the ball already. Realizing there was no way I could get there first, I felt we should drop back and tighten our defense. My pet, however, had other ideas.
