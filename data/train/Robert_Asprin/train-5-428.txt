All the skill in the dimensions can't change the outcome of one hand. That's luck... which puts us on an equal footing."    My opponent digested this for a few moments, then threw back his head and gave a bark of laughter.    "I love it!" he crowed. "A half million pot riding on one hand. Skeeve, I like your style. Win or lose, it's been a pleasure matching wits with you."
