Now this was a surprise. "What can I do for you, Captain?" she added. She wasn't inclined to do anything for him, but it was good policy to be minimally polite to somebody who had an armed Legion company on call.    "You can tell me where my butler is," snarled the captain. "Better yet, you can send him back-all in one piece, if you don't mind."
