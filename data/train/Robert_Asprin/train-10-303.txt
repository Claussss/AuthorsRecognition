   I floated us down to the road and then picked up speed,      skimming us toward Evade a lot faster than even a running horse could take us. To an outsider we must have looked very strange. Three strangers seeming to be just standing, but moving along the road at a very fast clip.    After only two minutes I was starting to feel the wear, but      before I had to stop Aahz said, "I think we're close enough now."
