Dusk was his  favorite time, when  the sun had  fled and the  night was luminous with memory. Sometimes, his thoughts would follow the light, fading, and the man who never slept would find himself dozing, at rest. This evening, it was not sleep he sought to chase in his private witching  hour: he  touched  her  scaled, enameled  armor,  its  gray/green/copper pattern  just dappled shadow in the deepening dark. "This does come off?" he asked her.
