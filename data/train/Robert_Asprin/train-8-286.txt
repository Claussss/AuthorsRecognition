While, as you know, I had much the same reaction the first time I met Spyder, for some reason it bothers me hearin' it from Tananda.    "Don't let the hair fool you." I sez, "She's pretty tough."    "That's sweet of you, Guido," Tananda sez, misunderstandin' what I was sayin', "but the day I can't hold my own against that, I'll hang it up. Well, off to work."
