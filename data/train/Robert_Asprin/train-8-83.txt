   "Leave him alone, you guys!"    This last comes from Spyder, who for some reason has seen fit to deal herself into the situational.    "Oh yeah?" Shu sneers, turnin' his attention toward this new front. "And who's going to make me?"    "If I have to, I will," Spyder shoots back.    "Oh yeah?"    "Well then, why don't you show us ... OW!"    By now I have cooled off enough to take advantage of the situational as it presents itself. As they puff up and start to strut toward Spyder, the two brothers have thoughtlessly and rudely turned their backs on me. Before they can close on her, I have stepped in behind and between them, and dropped a friendly arm around their shoulders.
