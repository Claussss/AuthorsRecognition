He shot a glance at his infrared sonar man who shrugged helplessly; there was no way he could sort out which blips were soldiers and which were reporters. "We were just wondering," the voice continued "if you were willing to be captured or if we're going to have to kill you?" The officer could see it all now.

They weren't going to surrender without a fight.
