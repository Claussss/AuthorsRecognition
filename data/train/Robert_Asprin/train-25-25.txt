Pete lit a cigarette and exhaled thoughtfully. "So our competition is a three-time loser and a loudmouthed whiz kid. If we can't beat that, we should hang it up." "That's the way I see it. But don't short-sell Marcus. If he's lasted this long, he must have something going for him. There's a chance someone's watching for some real dynamic ideas from him. We'll have to watch close, and if things look like they are leaning his way, decide if we go for the kill or if we want to cover."
