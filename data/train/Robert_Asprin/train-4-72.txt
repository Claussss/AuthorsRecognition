  "Yes, your Majesty?"   "Pass the word for General Badaxe. I'd like to see him."   "Umm... begging your Majesty's pardon. He's with a lady just now."   "Good. I mean, bring them both."   "Yes, your Majesty!"   The guard was gone with the same speed with which he had appeared.   I tried not to grin. I had never gotten along particularly well with the military of Possiltum. Of course, the fact that my first exposure to them was when Aahz and I were hired to fight their war for them might have something to do with it. Anyway, the thought of some poor honor guard having to interrupt his general's tetea-tete was enough to make me smile, the first in several days.
