  Does it seem to you I'm stalling? I am. You see, this demon I knew, and her name was Massha!   "Well hello, high roller! I was just in the neighborhood and thought I'd stop by and say 'Hi!' "   She started forward to give me a hug, and I hastily moved to put something immobile between us. A 'hi!' and a hug might not sound like a threat to you. If not, you don't know Massha!   I have nothing against hello hugs. I have another demon friend named Tananda (yes, I have a lot of demon friends these days) whose hello hugs are high points in my existence. Tananda is cute, curvaceous, and cuddly. Okay, so she's also an assassin, but her hello hugs can get a rise out of a statue.
