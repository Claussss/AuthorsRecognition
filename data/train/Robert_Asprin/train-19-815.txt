Lost in thought, Hakiem barely noticed the arrival of his fresh tankard, though from habit he was aware of the bartender slipping more than was his due from the pile of small coins on the table. Rather than take the offender to task for his greed, he chose instead to review the event which had led to his current state of mental confusion. Visits from the Beysa were common enough, and more often than not, involving subjects of a trivial nature.

Thus, he was unprepared for the direction their conversation took.
