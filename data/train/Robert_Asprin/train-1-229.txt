"Yo," he called back, while motioning his boys to cover the stones in the wagon. "Who comes?" One horse, out of the gloom; a single rider. He walked toward it, hand on his beltknife, his neck aprickle, back stiff. Finally the rider answered, "Zip, it's me." "Frog," Zip cursed under his breath. "Kama, stay there. The footing's tricky. I'll come up." He turned his head and said to his rebels, "Get down there, load the rest of the stones, take 'em where I told you. Careful to mark them and put them back just like they were. I'll catch up."
