   "We're all right," Nunzio puts in quick. "We're just a little worried about the Boss... like Massha. Joinin' the army is fine by us, if you think it will help things. Right, Guido?"    "I said it was okay, didn't I?" I snaps back at him.    "So what are you and Chumley going to be doin' while we're playing solider?" Nunzio sez. It is obvious to me that he is out to divert the attention of the meetin' away from the two of us, but no one else seems to notice... except maybe Big Julie who gives me the hairy eyeball for a minute before turnin' his attention back to the conversation.
