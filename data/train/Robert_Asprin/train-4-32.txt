  -SIR BELLA OF EASTMARCH    Now, I don't want you to think I'm a pushover. I drove a hard bargain with the King before giving in. I not only managed to get him to agree to a bonus, but to cough up a hefty percentage in advance before accepting the assignment. Not bad for a fledgling magician who was over a barrel.   Of course, once I accepted, I was no longer over a barrel. I was in over my head!
