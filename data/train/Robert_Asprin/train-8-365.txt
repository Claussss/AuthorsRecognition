   "... On Deva!" Don Bruce sez, droppin' the other shoe.    For a second Frumple's eyes snap wide open. Then he turns on us like a cornered rat.    "You ... you gave me your word!" he screeches. "You said you wouldn't tell anyone ..."    "They didn't have to tell me nothin'." Don Bruce snaps. "I got ears in a lot of places ... includin' the Bazaar."    "But I can't go back there!"    "I know that, too," Don Bruce sez cold-like. "Still, that's our offer. Either we set you up on Deva ... or you stay right here and pay for your own repairs. Take it or leave it."
