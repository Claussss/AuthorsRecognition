   Above I could see the ladder climbing at least twenty or so      of my body lengths before reaching what looked to be a wooden      trapdoor in a floor.    "Send Tanda up second," I whispered down to Aahz below me. "We need to make sure no one is in the room above the trap door up here."    "Good thinking," Tanda said, climbing up under me as I went higher. She got up just under me, paused, and then nodded. "No one up there at the moment."
