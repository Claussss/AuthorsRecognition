   "Sushi?" Shu Flie scowls. "You mean like raw fish?"    "At least we know it's fresh," Junebug sez, gesturin' at the second part of the sign.    "Oh, don't be a bunch of babies" Spyder grins, givin' Shu a poke in the ribs. "Wait 'til you've tried it. It's good! Come on."    Now, I am no more enthusiastic than the Flie brothers about eatin' this stuff, even though Nunzio has been after me for some time to give it a try. I mean, I'm used to fish in a tomato sauce or somethin', served with pastaâ€”not rice. Still, there seems little option than to follow Spyder and Nunzio as they merrily lead the way into the place.
