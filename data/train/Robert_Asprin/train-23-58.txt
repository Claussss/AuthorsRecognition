"Tell you what," she said at last. "You can count me in with two conditions." "What conditions?" Eisner prompted. "First, that we unanimously agree here and now that Dwight runs the show. That he becomes our captain officially." "Why?" Abuzar asked suspiciously. "Come on, Abuzar. You know as well as I do that there has to be one man at the top. Eventually we're going to be in situations where one person has to give the orders and make the decisions. I figure we should decide who that's going to be now, instead of arguing it out in the middle of a crisis. Dwight's been running things since Blutman died and doing a pretty good job of it. Nikki's too reckless, and even you don't trust your temper. I couldn't do it, and wouldn't want to if I could. To my thinking, that makes Dwight number one. If we can't agree on something as basic as that, we should call it quits right now."
