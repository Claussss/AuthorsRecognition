Terrific. I had been hoping that Chumley's analytic approach would simplify things for me. Instead, he had simply added a wagon load of other factors to be considered. I needed that like Deva needed more merchants. "Well, I appreciate the input, Chumley," I said, rising from my seat. "You've given me a lot to think about." "Think nothing of it, old boy. Glad to help." "And you're all set with the assignment? Guido told you how to hook up with Pookie?"
