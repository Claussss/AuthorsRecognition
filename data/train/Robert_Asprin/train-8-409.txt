   "The instructions," I echoes weakly, starin' at the pile.    All of a sudden this assignment is not lookin' as good as it had a few minutes ago.    The officer notices the expression on my face.    "Come, come now, sergeant," he sez, givin' me what I guess is supposed to be a fatherly smile. "It's not as bad as it looks."    "It isn't?"    "No. It's really quite simple once you get the hang of it. Just read these instructions all the way through, then follow everything they say to the letter, and everything will be fine."
