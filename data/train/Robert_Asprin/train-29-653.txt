How could he have been caught this way? Someone grabbed for the case that held his brushes and Lalo struck out, tried to duck as he sensed something falling towards him, but not fast enough, not quite fast- The shock of the blow stopped the world. Light and shadow, the hoarse gasps of his assailants and the shouting beyond them all faded as his senses whirled away. Gilla, I'm sorry- And then both regret and pain were extinguished as Lalo fell endlessly downward into the dark.
