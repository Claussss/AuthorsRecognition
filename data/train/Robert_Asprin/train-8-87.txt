   "Gaah! Yeah! Got it!"    "Anything you ... Owww ... say, Guido!"    "Oh yeah. Just one more thing. I don't talk funny. (grind) Agreed?"    "Aaaahhh ..."    "God ..."

I have neglected to mention durin' my previous instructional oration that if youse relaxes the aforementioned grip suddenly and completely, the resultin' rush of blood to the area which has been assaulted by said grip causes additional discomfort to a point where some subjects have been known to faint dead away. The advantage of this is obvious, in that you are not actually even touching them at the moment the effect takes hold.
