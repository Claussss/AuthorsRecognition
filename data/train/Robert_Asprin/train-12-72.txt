   me that Hay-ner is bluffing on that option. He wants us    to stick around the Bazaar as much as we want to stay.    He was the one who hired us in the first place, remem-   Robert Asprin   ber? I think he's expecting us to ante up and pay the    money. That way he gets back some of the squeeze he so    grudgingly parted with. Somehow the idea of giving in    to that kind of pressure really galls me."
