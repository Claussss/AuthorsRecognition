   "So we're going to let it stand as a win for the Space Legion?" Spengler said, trying to sting the officer's pride.    "Face it, Sergeant. We lost. They beat our time without passing up any obstacles... and they did it with ten times as many troops. Of course, we helped them. That was a pretty lackluster performance our boys put on today. Frankly I don't think we deserved to win this event. We goofed off while they busted ass. That's no way to come out on top."
