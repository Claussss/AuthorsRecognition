   "Walla walla Washington!" I said somberly.    I don't know what the words meant, but Aahz assured me they had historic precedence and would convince people I was actually doing something complex.    "A lla kazam shazam," I continued, raising my other arm. "Bibbity bobbity ..."    I mentally removed Gleep's disguise.    The crowd reacted with a gasp, drowning out my final "goo-gleep."    My dragon heard his name, though, and reacted immediately. His head came up and he lumbered forward to stand docilely at my side. As planned, Aahz immediately shambled forward to a position near Gleep's head and stood watchful and ready.
