   I thought this would bring any resistance on the proprietor's part to an end, but instead he straightens up and frowns, his eyes takin' on a mean glitter.    "You're from this dimension? You wouldn't happen to know a local magician and demon by the name of Skeeve, would you?"    As I have said before, I have not reached my current age and position by panicking under crosstype examination or by overratin' the necessity for voicin' the whole truth. I can see that this Deveel has some kind of grudge against the Boss, so while habitually avoidin' any false statement which could lead to perjury charges, I am careful not to acknowledge my actual relationship with the individual in question.
