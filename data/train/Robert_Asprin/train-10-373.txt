   I could feel my body starting to get really tired, as if some     one had pulled the energy plug and what I had left was draining onto the floor.    I dug into my pouch for the canister that I had been carry     ing. It was gone. I checked again and it was still not there. I couldn't remember doing anything with it, but I might have dropped it in the excitement of watching cows become vampires and bite on people.
