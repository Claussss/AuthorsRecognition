   "Bunch of times, Sarge," said Cheapshot. "Never convinced me, though. You wanna show the new guy how we do things in Omega, you gotta include the bad with the good, right?"    "Cheapshot makin' sense," said another voice, and Thumper could hear still others murmuring their agreement.    Then Brandy said, "Shut up!" and the murmurs stopped.    "OK," she said, "maybe you've got a point, Cheap shot. I'll agree that there's a lot of good things about the Omega way, but this is one of those times when I just want the good old Legion way. Believe me, there'll come a time when you'll thank me for this."
