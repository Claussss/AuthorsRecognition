Since Hanse knew  very well that  Ahdiovizun was not  from Twand, he  considered that stuff about Throde or Gimp to be highly unlikely. So what? Ahdio was better than all right, and  Throde was his helper,  and both Zip and  what-was-her-name Jes were in disguise, and-never mind how many lies were being told and lived out in the taproom. That stuff about Notable the red cat Hanse believed implicitly.
