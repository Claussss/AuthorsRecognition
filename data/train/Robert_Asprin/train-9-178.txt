   "Well... I guess you could say that."    "Good. Then I'm sure you won't mind givin' me the names of our citizens you're dealin' with." Too late I saw the trap. As a businessman, I should have local references. This may seem like a silly oversight to you, but you'll have to remember my background up to this point. Most of my ventures into the various dimensions have been more of the raider or rescue mission variety, so it never occurred to me there was another way of doing business.  Of course, admitting this would probably do little toward improving the impression I was making on this stalwart of the law.
