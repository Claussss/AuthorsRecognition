   That seemed like a strange question to me, but I answered it anyway.    "To a hotel, same as before."    "Uh-uh."    "Excuse me?" I said, puzzled.    "Hey, you hired a guide, you're going to get one. You're about to check into a hotel, right?"    "That's right."    "Well, you try to check into a Pervish hotel the way you are, without luggage, and they're going to give you a rough time whether they figure you're from off-dimension or not.  They'll be afraid that you're trying to get access to a room to steal the furniture or maybe to try to break into other rooms on the same floor."
