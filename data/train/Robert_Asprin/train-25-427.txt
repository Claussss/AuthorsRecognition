"Your old outfit? You mean during..." "During the Russo-Chinese War, right. The C-Block is about to break their communications silence, and we're delivering the message." "Since when did you work for the C-Block?" "Never stopped." "I see. Well, now what?" "Now you tell the guards they're relieved. Tell 'em it's bonus time off or something, but make it sound natural. My men have been briefed on you and your team and will be watching for anything out of line."
