   I went back to working my way up the tunnel, testing each      step, until finally I reached the end. A rock ladder had been carved      into the stone, leading straight up through a very narrow hole.    As Aahz stopped beside me I pointed up at the hole.    "Can you squeeze through there?"    "Do I have a choice?"    "I suppose not," I said. I handed him the torch. "Let me get up through the opening so I can brace my back against the wall, then hand me the torch."
