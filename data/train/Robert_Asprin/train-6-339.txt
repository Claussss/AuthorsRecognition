   "Yeah, kid?"    "How long are we going to stand here?"    "Until they notice us and do something about it."    Terrific. Either we'd rot where we stood, or someone would shoot us full of arrows.    We were standing about twenty yards from one of the encampments, with nothing between us and them but meadow. We could see clearly the bustle of activity within the encampment and, in theory, there was nothing keeping them from seeing us. This is why we were standing where we were, to draw attention to ourselves. Unfortunately, so far no one had noticed.
