Strangely enough, that made sense. In fact, Nunzio had managed to put into words my own nebulous concerns about my pet ... he didn't feel right. "Maybe we're going about this wrong," I said. "Maybe instead of trying to pin down what's wrong with him now, we should try to backtrack a bit." "I don't quite follow you," my bodyguard scowled. "Think back, Nunzio," I urged. When did you first notice that Gleep wasn't acting normal?"
