"Yes, who is it?" he said.    "Oh, I'm Brick, Captain," she said. "I'm new with the company, so I guess you don't know me yet..."    "Oh yes, of course," said Phule, flashing a fixed smile even as his head swiveled from side to side, as if trying to locate the source of Brick's voice. "What's the problem, uh, Brick? You don't have to hide-come on out where I can see you!"
