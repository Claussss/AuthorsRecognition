Bush made a face. "As near as I can tell we did, but damned if I know why." "There's some solid talk going around that it was an under-the-table agreement between the corporation hierarchies to weed out some of the management deadwood." "The 'forced retirement' bit? Yeah, I've heard that, but I don't believe it. Corporations pull some pretty sleazy moves when it comes to personnel management, but I can't believe they'd sink that low. Three years on half-pay would really be rough. I'm not sure I could take it. Oh well, I suppose it could be worse. They could be using real bullets."
