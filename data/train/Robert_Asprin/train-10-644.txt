   Then the room seemed to expand outward and the pressure of my head against the stone sent me down into a blackness I didn't much like.    "Skeeve!"    "Skeeve!  Can you hear me?"    The voice sounded far off, like it was coming from over a hill. I didn't care. It was still dark out and I wanted to sleep some more.    "Skeeve!"    The voice was getting closer, or so it seemed. I was in blackness. Pitch-black blackness. I tried to open my eyes, but everything still remained black. Every muscle in my body ached, and somehow I seemed to have fallen out of bed.
