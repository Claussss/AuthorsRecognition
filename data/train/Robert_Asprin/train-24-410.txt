Slowly I forced my head up to its normal level. "Leave it," I said, but more calmly. "Zur here, Commander." I held up a hand to the other two as I replied to Zur's beamed message. "Report, Zur." "Situation is in hand, Commander. Our assailant has been eliminated." "What is the condition of your team?" "Hif's arm is broken... No casualties beyond that." As I received the message, the view of the bush changed as the downed skimmer was pivoted to point back at the scene of the recent action. Zur was apparently beaming as he turned the skimmer; we could see the other three team members in the screen. Kor was working to right the other skimmer. Hif was assisting despite her broken arm. Zome was apparently examining the body of the dead spider.
