   "Think, then act," I said, repeating what Aahz had said a hundred times. "It's time to act."    With one last look at the town of Evade down in the valley, I took a deep breath and triggered the D-Hopper.    The storm slammed into me like a hammer. I tucked the D-Hopper into my shirt and focused on how Tanda had led us the other three times to the cabin. The dust didn't let me see anything around me, but I knew there were some scattered trees. We had passed them the last two times.
