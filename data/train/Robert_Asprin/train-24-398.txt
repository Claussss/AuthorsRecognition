"We're in position, Commander." "Does Hif observe anything unusual about the boulders?" "No. She claims they are identical in color to the rocks which abound throughout the area." I studied the boulders in the View Screen. The Technicians had established a bank of View Screens in the fortification, allowing us to monitor the images relayed by the view-input units mounted on either the flyers or the skimmers. By this method we were able to indirectly observe whatever transpired on a patrol or assignment.
