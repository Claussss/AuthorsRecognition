Aahz seemed calm enough ... in fact, he seemed to be suspiciously calm. While I wasn't wild about his shouting at me, at least it was consistent. This new display of reasonability was making me uneasy ... rather like suddenly noticing the sun just rose in the west. "So ... what are you doing here, partner?" I said, trying to sound casual. "I was looking for you. It occurred to me that you might need a sympathetic ear while you figured out what to do next."
