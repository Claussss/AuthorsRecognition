   "Oh, there's no problem in your asking me... or in your terms. I'm just not going to stay."    By now my head was spinning with confusion, but I tried to maintain what little poise I had left.  "... But I thought... Oh, well. I guess I was mistaken."    "No you weren't. If you had asked me in the first place, I would have stayed."    "Then why..."I began, but the Djin waved me into silence.    "I'm sorry, Skeeve. I shouldn't tease you with head games at a time like this. What changed my mind was something you said while you were explaining why you didn't ask. You said you were scared and insecure, which is only sane, all things considered. But then you added something about how you were afraid to trust your own judgment and therefore needed someone else along to tell you whether you were right or not."
