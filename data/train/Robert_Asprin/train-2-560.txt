a weapon here we could use against Isstvan, but the smell of the Pervish food was even stronger now, and I steeled myself to finish my search. We could look for a weapon after I found Aahz. From the intensity of the stench, I was sure we would find our objective soon.             "C'mon, Gleep," I encouraged.             The dragon was hanging back now and didn't respond except to speed his pace a bit.
