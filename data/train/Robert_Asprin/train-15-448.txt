"Not all of them, sir," said Brandy. "We have new recruits in the company."    "A good while since, if I recall," said Botchup, frowning. He shook a finger at the sergeant. "You should know them by now."    "Yes, sir," said Brandy, spitting out the words as if they were burning her tongue. Her face was as expressionless as Armstrong's, but even a new recruit would have spotted her blazing eyes, and-if he valued his hide-proceeded to make himself scarce. Very scarce.
