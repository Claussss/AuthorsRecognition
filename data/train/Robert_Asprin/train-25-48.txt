"Decker! They're set! Blow it!" Nothing happened. "Decker! Can you read me? Blow it!" He tapped the mike with his fingernail. Still nothing. "Blow it, damn you..." Tidwell rolled to his feet and darted around the corner. Even though it sounded loud in the stillness of night, that was no explosion. Someone was shooting, probably at him. "Decker! Blow it!" No mistaking it now. He was drawing fire. Cursing, he snapped off a round in the general direction of the shots, but it was a lost cause and he knew it. Already he could hear shouts as more men took up the pursuit. If he could only lead them away from the charges. Ducking around a corner, he flattened against the wall and tried to catch his breath. Again he tried the mike.
