"Sounds good to me," my date declared, giving a little shiver that seemed to take her entire body. "Are there any good clubs on this dimension?" It only took me a second to realize she was talking about nightclubs, not the kind of club you beat people across the head with. I DO catch on eventually. "I'm not sure," I admitted. "My work doesn't leave me much time to check out the nightlife." "Hey! When it comes to nightlife, I'm your girl. I know some GREAT places over on Limbo."
