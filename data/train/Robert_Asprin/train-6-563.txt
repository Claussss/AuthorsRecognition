   "Hey, kid!" Aahz called, barging through my door without knocking. "Have you got a corkscrew?"    "What's a corkscrew?" I asked reflexively.    "Never mind," my mentor sighed. "I'll do it myself."    With that, he shifted the bottle of wine he was holding to his left hand, and inserted the claw on his right forefinger into the cork. The cork made a soft pop as he gently eased it from the neck of the bottle, whereupon the cork was casually tossed into a corner as Aahz drank deeply of the wine.
