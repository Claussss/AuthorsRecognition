Because of me he has been blooded, Tempus mused, and the weary thought followed: Well, he's not the first. I had my first two, once. I wonder who they were,  and where? (But he knew, he knew. A man did not forget such. Tempus  was older  than anyone  thought; he  was not  as world-weary  old as  he thought, or  thought he  thought.) Just  now he  wanted to  put forth a hand and touch the much younger man. He certainly did not.
