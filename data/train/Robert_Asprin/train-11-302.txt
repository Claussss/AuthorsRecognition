"So much for the witnesses," my mentor grinned, winking at me.    "Where'd they all go?" I asked, craning my neck to look around.    "Home, of course," Aahz smirked. "No one likes the draft-particularly when it affects them personally."    I wet my finger and tested the breeze. "There's not that much wind today," I announced suspiciously.
