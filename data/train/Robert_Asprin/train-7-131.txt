   "Um ....ell, there's no denying she's attractive."    Tananda nodded her agreement.    "...In a cheap, shallow sort of way, I suppose," she acknowledged.    "Of course," I said carefully, "she does have a little problem with overachievement."    "A little problem! Chumley, you have a positive talent for understatement. Bunny's one of the pushiest bitches I know."    I was suddenly quite glad I had not verbalized my thought comparing Bunny's overachievement problem with little sister's. I somehow doubted Tananda was including herself in her inventory of pushy bitches. Still, there was one more point I wanted to test the ice with.
