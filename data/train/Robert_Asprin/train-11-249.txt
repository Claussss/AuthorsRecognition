   We picked our way across Veygus, occasionally stopping people to ask directions, and arrived at last outside the dwelling of the town magician. It was an unimposing structure, barely inside the eastern limits of the city, and exuded an intriguing array of aromas.    "Not much of a hangout for a powerful magician, eh, Aahz?" I commented, trying to bolster my sagging courage.    "Remember where you were living when we first met?" my mentor retorted, never taking his eyes from the building.
