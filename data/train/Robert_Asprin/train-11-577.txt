   "Tanda and Chumly make one team. Badaxe, you stick with Gus. He's your ticket home," I repeated needlessly.    "We know what to do," the general nodded.    "Then let's do it!" I shouted, and wheeled Gleep into position.    This time, as the ball came into play, we did not swarm toward the ball carrier. Instead, our entire team back-pedaled to cluster in the mouth of our goal.    Our opponents hesitated, looking at each other. We had emptied over three quarters of their reserve teaching them to respect our strength, and now that lesson was bearing fruit. No one seemed to want to be the one to carry the ball into our formation. They weren't sure what we were up to but they didn't want any part of it.
