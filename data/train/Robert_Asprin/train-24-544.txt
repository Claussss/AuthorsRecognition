"What is the position you desire, Zur?" "Second-in-command and Commander of the reserve force," he answered promptly. I considered this. "Might I inquire," I asked, "why you prefer that position over assignment as a Planetary Commander?" "My reasons are two, Rahm. First, my experience in the Warriors caste thus far has been of a supportive nature as opposed to a direct leadership role. I am confident of my abilities in that capacity, and would prefer to continue in the role I feel most efficient in."
