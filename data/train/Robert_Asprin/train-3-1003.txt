had  left the  caravan yesterday  afternoon when  it halted  here, just  outside Sanctuary. They had gone on down into  the town for a little of the  partying he had denied them en route from  Aurvesh. Now, just after midday, they'd  come the short distance back out here to the encampment. Looking for trouble. Fulcris  wasn't the  sort to  pretend not  to see  them and  be somewhere  else, however wise that would have been. They had obviously been drinking their lunch.
