   Finally, after what seemed like a nightmarish eternity, we      reached an area of the tunnel that flattened out.    "Map," Aahz said.    Tanda moved up and the two of us crowded with Aahz so that we could see the map in the torchlight and swirling dust.      It showed that we had reached the bottom of the tunnel. I glanced around at the rock walls and ceiling. We were under thousands and thousands of body-lengths of rock. I couldn't imagine how much weight was pressing down on the ceiling of the tunnel above us right at that moment.
