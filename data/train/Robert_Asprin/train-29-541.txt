Divorce was all he had on his mind these days. Treachery. That's all Daphne had on hers. There was another traitor that everyone seemed to conveniently overlook, a man who'd befriended Chenaya, pretended to love her- He'd helped her shape the trap that had netted Zip that night, and he'd killed piffles right at her mistress's side. Then, he'd let Zip go, freed the piece of offal that-more than any man in the world-he had reason to hate, cause to kill.
