At most... well, there are ways of sabotaging other people's success."    "You mean they're going to ..."    "That's enough!" Chumley declared, slapping his palm down on the table loudly.    It suddenly occurred to me that I had never seen Chumley mad. It also occurred to me that I was glad our furniture was strong enough to withstand even Aahz's tirades. If not, the troll would have destroyed the table just stopping the conversation.
