   Tanda said she hadn't either.    That answer didn't comfort me at all.    I kept us going longer and longer, not wanting to rest and      have all the cows gather close to us. By the time the sun came      up I had flown us to the edge of Bank City. I was exhausted and was going to have to get a few hours sleep before we went on.    At first light, the moment the sun peeked over the edge of      the nearby mountains, the cows stopped watching us and went back to grazing.
