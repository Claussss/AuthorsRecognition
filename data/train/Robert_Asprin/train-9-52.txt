   It suddenly occurred to me that I wasn't making as much use of my Djin as I might. I mean, he had said that one of the things he was good at was advice, hadn't he?  "I don't know, Kalvin. I've never had much trouble with them. In fact, one of the things Aahz told me was that Pervects manufacture and spread a lot of the bad rumors about themselves just to discourage visitors."    "Oh, yeah?"    The Djin seemed unconvinced.
