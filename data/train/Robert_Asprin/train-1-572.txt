A shudder plus a vigorous nod made Melilot's gross body wobble under his fine robe. "But how does he make shift aboard a ship?" he demanded. "If he may not sleep twice in the same bed-" "He brought a hammock, and each night slung it from two different posts or hooks. This is permissible." "Then: eating twice from the same table?" "Until this evening I had not seen him eat from a table at all. Aboard ship, he carried his dish to a different spot on deck or in the 'tween-decks, but this strategem did not entirely serve; our voyage, as you know, was prolonged by a contrary wind, and for the last two days he did not eat at all. In the tavern where I met him, where he had already spent a week, he had to bribe its keeper to move him each night to a different bunk or pallet, and since there were only two tables for the customers he was reduced to eating on the floor, like a dog. He was much mocked in consequence."
