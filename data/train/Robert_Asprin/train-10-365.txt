   The last person moved past us, leaving the town empty and every door standing wide open. I had no idea what we should do. I took the canister out of my pouch and downed the last of the second glass of carrot juice, just to be ready for whatever was coming.    Aahz motioned that we should follow them, so, moving      slowly about thirty steps behind the last person, we followed      the line of people out into the countryside, along the very same road we had planned on traveling.
