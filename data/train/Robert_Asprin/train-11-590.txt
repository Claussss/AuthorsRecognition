   The team gestured grandly at me. With a grin, I let the disguise drop away from the Trophy.    "Ta-da!" I warbled. "Happy birthday, Aahz."    "Happy birthday!!" the team echoed.    Aahz looked at their grins, then at the Trophy, then at their grins again.    "All right," he sighed. "Break out the wine."    The roar of approval for this speech rivaled anything that had come from the stands that afternoon as the team descended on the wine barrels like a swarm of hungry humming mice.
