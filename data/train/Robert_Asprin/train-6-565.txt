   "Um... that's what I was going to show you," I admitted. "I've figured out how to get the brazier to come to me all by itself ... no levitation or anything."    "Swell," Aahz grunted. "Now, can you make it stop?"    "Um ... I don't know," I said, sitting down quickly in one of the chairs.    I didn't want to admit it, but while we were talking I had tried several mental commands to get the brazier to go away, all without noticeable effect. I'd have to work this out on my own once Aahz had left.
