   "There's no time," I declared. "We've got to get going."    "Get going where?" she frowned.    "Back to Klah," Gus grumbled. "Skeeve here is in the middle of abandoning Aahz."    "He's what?" Tananda gasped.    "Gus ..." I warned.    "Save it, handsome. I'm not budging until someone tells me what's going on, so you might as well start now."    It took surprisingly little time to bring her up to date once I got started. I deliberately omitted as many details as possible to keep from getting Tananda riled. I had enough problems on my hands without fighting her, too! It seemed to work, as she listened patiently without comment or frown.
