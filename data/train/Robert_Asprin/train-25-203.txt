"Mr. Yamada! Will you read aloud the note I passed you before the fight began." Mr. Yamada rose slowly from his seat with the other company officials, unfolded the note, and read: "I will strike Aki's right forearm two to four times, then try to stop the fight." He sat down and a murmur rippled through the force. "The point of the fight was to determine if I was qualified to lead this force in battle. At this point I have shown that not only can I strike your champion repeatedly, but that I can predict his moves in advance. This will be my function as your commander, to guide you against an enemy I know and can predict, giving maximum effectiveness to your skills. Having demonstrated this ability, I wish to end this duel if my opponent agrees. I only hope he embraces the same philosophy I do-that if given a choice, I will not waste lives. I will not kill or sacrifice my men needlessly. That is the way of the martial arts, and the way of the mercenary. Aki! Do you agree with me that the duel is over?"
