Supported between them was the limp, pale form of Lieutenant Snipe.    "What the hell?" said Botchup, as Jester and Armstrong maneuvered the unconscious Snipe to a seat.    "Stand back, sir, let him have some air," said Armstrong. He stepped over to the water cooler and filled a disposable cup and brought it back to Snipe. "We think he'll be all right, but he's got to get a few moments to breathe."
