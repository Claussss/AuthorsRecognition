   Again I touched each of them, pulled in the power, and lifted us, sending us down the road as fast as I dared take us, considering I had to make sharp corners and steep hills.    This time I lasted ten minutes before I had to stop. Water      and a quick rest got me going again, just as the sun started to      set. From what I could tell, we were a long way yet from Baker.      It was getting noticeably cooler, which was also helping me.
