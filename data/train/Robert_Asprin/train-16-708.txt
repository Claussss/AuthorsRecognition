   The butler stared at the items for a few moments, then sank into a chair and turned on a lamp.    "Hey, Beeker!" Harry said, awakened by the light. "What's up?"    Beeker ignored him, bending over his own wrist communicator as he depressed the Call button.    "That you, Beeker?" came Mother's voice. "What are you doing up at this hour? I thought-"    "Give me an open channel to Lieutenants Armstrong and Rembrandt," the butler said tersely. "And Mother? I want to listen in as well. We have an emergency situation, and there's no point wasting time going over the information twice."
