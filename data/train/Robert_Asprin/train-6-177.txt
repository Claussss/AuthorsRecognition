Aahz countered. "While they're still holding the unicorn, we've lost money on the deal."    "Aahz," I reminded him. "Buttercup didn't cost us anything, remember? He was a gift from Quigley."    "It would cost money to replace him," Aahz insisted. "That means that we lost money on the deal unless we get him back. I've told you, I want a profit ... and definitely refuse to accept a loss."
