  But I digress.   We started out with me simply walking into my room. Yeah, simple! There was a demon waiting for me, a Pervect to be exact. This in itself wasn't unusual. Aahz, the teacher I mentioned earlier, is a Pervect. In fact, he shares my quarters with me. What was unusual was that the demon waiting for me wasn't Aahz!   Now I haven't met many Pervects... heck, the only one I know is Aahz... but I know Aahz very well, and this Pervect wasn't him!
