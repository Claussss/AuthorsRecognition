pointed dome resembled  an elongated onion.  Its needle-like spire  thrust up to pierce the sky. That spire, naturally, flaunted a pennon. It bore the device  of Imperial Ranke (Ranket  Imperatris). Below, the  dome was clamped  by a circular wall like  upended herbivorous  teeth. If  ever the  palace were  attacked, that crenellated wall promised, beware archers in the embrasures between the merlons!
