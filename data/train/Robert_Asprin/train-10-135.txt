   The young lady didn't seem to be at all surprised to see Aahz, which worried me even more. Pervects tended to scare people, either by their looks or their reputations.    I finally managed to find the words I needed to ask.    "How do you know me?"    "She knows you?" Aahz asked.    Clearly he had been too far out in the dust storm to hear her over the blowing wind.    The girl laughed and I got even more afraid of her. The laugh was perfect, sort of gentle, yet free and high, like a soft breeze on a summer's afternoon. The exact laugh I would expect from a young lady as beautiful as she was, yet never got, at least from the few I had met.
