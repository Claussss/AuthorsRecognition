   As I mentioned, our guards are okay guys and in a pretty good mood to boot, which is understandable as they was fightin' on our side in the fracas under discussion. We have a pretty good time with them while we are waitin', swappin' tales from the fight that were at least partially true, interruptin' each other all the time with comments of "Did you see it when I . , . ?" and "Yeah, what about when that big cop... ." In fact, we are gettin' downright chummy with 'em, but then the captain walks in.
