"The man who looks in front of him does not stumble and fall," said the manikin with his usual preternatural clarity of voice. "Samlor," said the Napatan, "I appreciate what you say ... but what I seek is here, and I've made a very long-" "Sure," the caravan master interrupted. "I just mean we be careful, all right? "And you, child," Samlor added in a voice as soft as a cat's claws extending. He knelt so that Star could meet his eyes without looking up. "You don't touch anything, do anything. Do you understand? Because if the only way to keep you safe is to tie you up and carry you like a sack of flour-that's what I'll do."
