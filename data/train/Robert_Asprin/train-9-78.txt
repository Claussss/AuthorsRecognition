   "Where to?" the driver said, casually forcing his vehicle back into the flow of traffic.    "Urn, just take me to a hotel."    "Expensive... cheap... what?"    "Oh, something moderate, maybe a bit on the inexpensive side."    "Right."    I was actually pretty well set financially. A money belt around my waist had over two thousand in gold I had brought along to cover expenses on my search. Still, there was no sense throwing it away needlessly, and I figured since didn't plan to spend much time in my room, I wouldn't need anything particularly grand.
