"Then we're free to go?"    "Well, there are a few more questions you'll have to answer first. After that, you're free to..."    "That's â€˜more' as in new questions, not the same ones all over again. Right?"    The policeman glared at me, but now that I knew we were in the clear, I was starting to have fun with this.  "That's right," he said through gritted teeth.
