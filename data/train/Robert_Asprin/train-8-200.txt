Fortunately, in trainin' I have discovered there is one way to shut this particular individual up when he gets on a roll.    "Shu Flie," I sez, "don't bother me."    It was an old joke by this time, but it still got a laugh ... which is not surprisin' as I have found that the vast majority of army humor pivots on old jokes.
