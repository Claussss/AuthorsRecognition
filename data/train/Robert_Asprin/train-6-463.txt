   "What for?" I asked. I didn't like the way he was eyeing Tanda.    "To bring you word of our decision, of course," the commander shrugged. "None of my men would dare enter your camp, even granted a messenger's immunity."    There was a mocking tone to his voice I didn't like.    "I'll stay, Skeeve," Aahz volunteered.    I considered it. Aahz had demonstrated his ability to take care of himself time and time again. Still I didn't trust the commander.
