   "Um... Quigley?" I ventured cautiously. I still had a vivid image in my mind of my tongue in Aahz's grasp instead of the wine goblet.    "Yes, lad?" Quigley asked, cocking an eyebrow at me.    "What did you say would happen if the Trophy were returned?"    Aahz's head swiveled around slowly until our gazes met, but his gold speckled eyes were thoughtful now.    "Well, I didn't say, actually," Quigley grumphed, "but that would change everything. With the Trophy back, the council would be ecstatic and definitely better disposed toward Tanda... . Yes, if the Trophy were returned, I think I could find an excuse to release her."
