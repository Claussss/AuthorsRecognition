'unknown', but the story had better be good! Christine DeWees is  a kindly, white-haired  grandmother who rides  a Harley and wants to be a writer. Lynn and I have been criticizing her efforts for some time and have repeatedly encouraged her to submit something to an editor. So far, she has resisted our proddings, insisting that she would be embarrassed to show  her work to a professional editor. I decide to kill two birds with one stone.
