   I gestured at him with my glass, and realized it was full again. So much for my resolve. I also realized the pitcher was almost empty.    "That's a rough one, Skeeve," the Djin was saying, and I tried to focus on his words. "I think everybody has to reach their own answer, though it's a rare person who even thinks to ask the question. I will say it's an over-simplification to try to equate caring about someone with weakness, just as I think it's wrong to assume that if we can learn from our friends, they're actually controlling our thinking." He stopped and stared at my hand. I followed his gaze and realized I was trying to fill my empty glass from an empty pitcher.
