   "Get the ball to me!" I called to my teammates. "I've got an idea."    "What kind of an idea?" Aahz asked.    "Just get me the ball," I snapped back.    I didn't mean to be short with him, but if this plan was going to work, I needed all my concentration, and Aahz's banter wasn't helping.    Closing my eyes, I-began to draw and focus power. At the same time, I began forming the required images in my mind.
