   "Tell you what," the bartender said, leaning close. "When the manager comes in, let me talk to him first ... maybe put in a good word for you."    "Hey. I appreciate that."    "And let me get you another brew while you're waiting ... on me."    As the bartender headed off, Harry turned on his stool and rested his elbows on the bar, surveying his new home.    There was a small dining area attached to the bar, not more than a dozen tables, though those tables were widely spaced, leading Harry to believe it was more of a gathering point than a profit generator. Only a few of the tables were occupied, and those customers, by their dress and manner, seemed to be locals rather than tourists.
