   "Open it all the way and see where we are," Glenda said. "It's clear."    Aahz, much to his credit, didn't turn around to check to see if she was right. He simply opened the map and spread it out over our plates of bad food.    No one paid any attention.    The golden cow palace was marked on the map. Well, at      least we knew where that was.    Evade, the town we were in now was also marked. The road between them was marked as the lines between dimenÂ­sions had been marked. There were a lot of other towns along the way, and one thing was very, very clear. We were still a long way from the golden cow.
