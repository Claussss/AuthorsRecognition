as it found  its home in  one's innards -  again and again,  Hakiem pondered the facts of the story. It fitted. Lately  someone had  been stalking  wizards, slaying  them in  their own   beds. Apparently the hunter's knife had  struck down the spell-weaver who  was holding One-Thumb  in  painful thrall,  freeing  him suddenly  to  his normal  life.  An interesting story, but totally useless to Hakiem.
