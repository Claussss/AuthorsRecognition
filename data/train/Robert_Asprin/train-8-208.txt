   "A Deveel!" I sez, hidin' my own surprise.    Actually, I am a little annoyed at myself for not havin' figured it out on my own. I mean, no matter what he looked like, I had been thinkin' that he was actin' like a Deveel since I first set eyes on him.    The reaction of our crew to this discovery, however, is nothin' compared to the reaction we gets from the proprietor.    "WHAT ARE YOU DOING!!??" he screeches, lookin' around the place desperately, only to find we are the only ones present. "YOU TRYIN' TO GET ME LYNCHED???"
