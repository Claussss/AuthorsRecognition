  "Do you know who you're talking to?" I called back, and hoped.   There was a moment's pause.   "I assume I'm talking to Skeeve the Magnificent, Court Magician of Possiltum. At best, he'll be the one to bear the brunt of my wrath if I'm kept waiting outside his chambers much longer."   So much for hoping. These things never work in real life the way they do in jokes.   Moving with undignified haste, I pounced on the door handle and wrenched it open.
