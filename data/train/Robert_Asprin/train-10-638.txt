   "We have to keep it out of the flow until it's big enough," Aahz said.    "Okay," I said. "Let's do this and get on to the next life."    Aahz laughed. "That's what I like about you, apprentice. Always a good mental attitude."    "Give me something to be positive about," I said.    Aahz moved around and got under me, bracing himself solidly as I held the shovel up in position next to the side-flow of energy. When the gold got big enough for what Tanda was going to do, we were going to simply let the shovel fall to our right and cut off the side-flow to the spell. However, if we let the shovel fall forward into the main flow, there was no telling what would happen.
