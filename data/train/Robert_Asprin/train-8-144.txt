   Again he has hit on a valid point. Skeeve has easily been the most considerate Boss we have ever worked with and has always been sensitive to our feelin's ... especially those which is attached to parts of us which bleed or break. This has a lot to do with the loyalty and genuine affection we hold for him ... along with his pay scale which is both generous and dependable.    "Now that you mention it," I sez, "it wouldn't make much sense for the Boss to get into a power struggle or try to take over from Don Bruce, as he has never expressed any interest in or desire to elevate his standin' in the Mob."
