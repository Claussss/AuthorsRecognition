Terrific. I start out looking for a little privacy and end up leading a parade. "So, what do you think, Aahz?" I asked. I knew I was going to get his opinion sooner or later, and figured I might as well ask outright and get it over with. "About what?" "About my problem," I clarified. "What problem?" "Sorry. I thought you had been listening when I explained it to Gleep. I'm talking about the whole situation with Queen Hemlock."
