The last thing we need right now is for the cops to act reasonable. I figure it is about time I take a hand in the proceedin's personally.    "Oh, yeah?" I sneers. "What happened? You chicken out when it looked like there might actually be some fightin' to be done? Figured it was safer hasslin' drunks than gettin' shot at?"
