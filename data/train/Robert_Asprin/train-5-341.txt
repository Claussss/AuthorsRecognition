"No. I mean, why should you lean on Gleep? You look comfortable where you are."    Nunzio rolled his eyes. "I don't mean â€˜lean on him' like really lean on him. I mean, do you want me to bend him a little? You know, rough him up some. I stay outta things between you and your partner, but you shouldn't have to put up with that kind of guff from a dragon."
