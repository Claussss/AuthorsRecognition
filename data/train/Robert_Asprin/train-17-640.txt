Rain pelted his face and he lay still, still, while the killer plant died. It was not  raining in Sanctuary  but out of  a clear night  sky came a sizzling bolt that  hardly  rocked  the  structure  that  grounded  it.  The  graven name VASHANKA,  however, abruptly  disappeared from  the  facade  of that  structure, which  was the Governor's Palace. Oh damn, but my damned head aches! Pox and plague, that's rain on my face and I'm getting soaked!
