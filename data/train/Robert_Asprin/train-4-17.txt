  Somehow I couldn't make myself believe it had happened. My mentor had been spirited away... permanently. Whatever I had learned from Aahz would have to do, because now I was totally on my own.   Then I heard a knock at my door. Chapter Two:    "When things are blackest, I just tell myself 'cheer up, things could be worse!' And sure enough, they get worse!"    I DECIDED that as Court Magician of Possiltum, my response should be gracious.
