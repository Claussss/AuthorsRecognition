   "Well, Mother, we're here!" the portly gentleman declared, giving his wife a hug with one arm as they walked.    "Henry ... how old would you say that young man at the front desk is?" the frumpy woman at his side inquired.    "Oh, I don't know," the man said, glancing back. "Late twenties, early thirties, I'd guess. It's hard to tell with kids these days. Why do you ask?"    "Just curious," his wife said with a shrug. "He struck me as being a bit young to be wearing a hearing aid."
