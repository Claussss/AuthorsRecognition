"To make silk, you must schappe-get rid of the part of the cocoon that isn't silk." In a comer of the commander's mind there was a mote of dusty knowledge whispering that silk didn't come into being as dyed, woven cloth, any more than wool or linen did. Wool came from sheep, and linen came from a plant, and silk ... ? Did silk come from a cocoon?

But that goo hanging over her fingers like so much melted cheese or worse ... that couldn't possibly be silk.
