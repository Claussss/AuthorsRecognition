seeing here: expensive goods  tossed randomly with no  regard to their value.  A prince's ransom had been ruined with careless handling ... He decided  that he  wouldn't like  Ischade. His  time in  palaces and  brothels taught him to appreciate objects that  he could never afford and to  be offended at their neglect. At least  royalty knew how to take  care of their toys ...  or had servants who did.
