   I didn't like the sound of that, either.    Aahz pulled off his gloves and took out the map, spread     ing it on the floor so we could all see it by the light of the fire.      As expected, the map had changed again. There were now six      lines leading from Vortex #4, all to points that now had names. All six lines headed in the general direction of the point marked      as the treasure, but none directly.  This map wasn't making anything easy, that was for sure.
