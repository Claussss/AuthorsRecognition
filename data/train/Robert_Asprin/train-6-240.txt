   "Gleep?" he said, cocking his head at me curiously.    I picked myself up from the dust where I had been knocked by his enthusiasm and cuffed him.    "Watch where you're going next time," I ordered angrily.    He responded by snaking out his long tongue and licking my face. His breath was devastating and his tongue left a trail of slime. Obviously my admonishment had terrified him.    Heaving a deep sigh, I sprinted off after Aahz with Gleep lumbering along in hot pursuit.
