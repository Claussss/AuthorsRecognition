"I kin' stand up by myself," Ajax insisted. "Just â€˜cause I'm old don't mean I'm helpless."    I glanced to Aahz for help, but he and Tanda were already headed out.    As I turned back to Ajax, I thought I caught a glimpse of a small, blue figure slipping out through the door ahead of us. If it was the Gremlin, he was nowhere in sight when I finally reached the street.
