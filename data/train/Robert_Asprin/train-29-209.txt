"For godssake, find him!" "What-" Her eyes snapped shut and open again, present and shocked, as she clapped her hands together and smothered the light. "Aaah!" Stilcho cried, and held his hands over his eyes. Straton and Ischade exchanged a look then which understood something Stilcho did not. "What is it, dammit?" Ischade bit her lips and drew in her breath. "Nothing. Nothing need concern you." She gathered her skirts to rise. "I will find him. There's nothing I can do from here. We'll have to search out the trail. Stilcho." She gave him her hand, and he helped her to her feet.
