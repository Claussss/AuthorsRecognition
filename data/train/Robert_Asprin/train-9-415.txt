   A few moments later, a voice suddenly rasped from the wall next to my elbow.    "Who is it?"    It only took a few seconds for me to figure out that it was some kind of speaker system.    "It's... I'ma friend of your son, Aahz... Aahzmandius, that is. I was wondering if I might talk to you for a few moments?"    There was a long pause before the reply came back.  "I suppose if you're already here I might as well talk to you. Come right up."
