He'd thought of  just considering the  whole unsightly and  unnatural mess as  a funeral pyre, calling  for reinforcements, and  making the Peres  estate Strat's bier. They'd  say the  rites, play  some funeral  games, he'd  put everything he owned up as prize or sacrifice. But he couldn't  do that, not  until he knew  for certain that  Strat really was dead, and wholly dead: not likely to be resurrected by Ischade.
