"Have a seat, Ramona," Tambu said. "We have a lot to talk about." The girl sank loosely into a chair, casually dangling one leg over its arm. "You'll forgive my appearance. I was planning to inspect a cargo, not meeting and impressing new people." She was wearing a form-fitting T-shirt, dark green with a unicorn on it. Her pants were black denim with button-flap pockets on the thighs, and her boots were ankle-high and soft-soled. She was indeed more appropriately dressed for a work crew than for receiving visitors.
