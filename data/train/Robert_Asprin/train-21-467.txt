"Thanks, Massha," I said, forcing a smile. "That does help a bit." I glanced up to see General Badaxe stepping forward. He had been so quiet I had forgotten he was in the room until he cleared his voice. "Will you excuse us, my dear? I'd like to have a word with Lord Skeeve." Massha glanced back and forth between the General and me, then shrugged. "Sure thing, Hugh. Gods know I've got enough to keep me busy for a while. Catch you later, Hot Shot."
