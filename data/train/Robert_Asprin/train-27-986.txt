Before  he could stop  her she  had gone  to pick  up the  painting and  brought it to him, leaning it against the wall. He stared  at it,  reading it  as he  had read  Gilla's face  a moment  ago, and knowing that he would never be able to forget the journey from which he had just returned. It would take some getting used to.
