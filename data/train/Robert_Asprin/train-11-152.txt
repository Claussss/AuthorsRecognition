In hindsight, I realize that was the last thing to go right for some time.    "Well, kid," Aahz exclaimed, looking about him eagerly, "where do we go?"    "I don't know," I admitted, scanning the horizon.    Aahz frowned. "Let me run this by you slowly," he sighed. "You've been here before, and I haven't. Now, even your limited brain should realize that that makes you the logical guide. Got it?"
