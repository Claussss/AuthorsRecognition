   "I understand our agreement," Tanda said before Aahz could say a word. "Vortex #4 please."    The snakelike-shaped Shifter nodded, and again we were whisked through to another dimension.    And right back into the same stupid dust storm.    Okay, I have to admit that when we dimension-hopped back into the dust storm, I was shocked.    Tanda motioned that we should follow her. It took me almost all the way to our destination before I realized where we were. Now granted, I had the excuse that it was blowing heavily. And to me, one dust storm looks just like another. But it wasn't until the old log cabin loomed up out of the dust like a ship in the fog that it dawned on me that we were back in the same place.
