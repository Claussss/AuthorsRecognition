travelling unequipped through the mountains this late in the fall was too great. They  approached  the  Unicorn  through back  alleys,  and  saw  almost no  one. Apparently the denizens  of the Maze  were as fond  of entertainments as  anyone else in  Sanctuary. No  doubt the  opportunity to  watch their  prince extricate himself from a collapsed tent was almost the best entertainment of the  evening.
