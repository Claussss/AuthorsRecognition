   to deal with in the past, this looked like a piece of cake.   Signaling the others to stay put, I stepped out onto    the road behind my target couple.   "Excuse me!" I called "I'm new to this area and in    need of a little assistance. Could you direct me to the    nearest town?"   Translation pendants were standard equipment for    dimension travel, and as I was wearing one now, I had    no fear of not being understood.
