"Cease fire!" We sat motionless for several long moments waiting for the rock to cool and until we were sure that any rockslides caused by our burning had run their course. "One at a time...Wait until the flyer ahead of you has cleared the entrance before following!" With that, I set the foot disc and trod down on it to start the engine. As I felt it begin to convert its power, I rocked my body forward in the flyer. It slid off the edge of the ledge and plunged toward the floor of the cavern. Immediately I began working the controls, and the wings spread, catching the air and changing my fall into a swooping climb. A few adjustments, and I was out in the sunlight.
