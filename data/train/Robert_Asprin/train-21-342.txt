I thought about what he had said for a few minutes. "You're right, Aahz," I said finally. "Being respected is more important than being liked." With that, I veered off to head in a different direction than the one we had been walking. "Where are you going, partner?" "I'm going to see Bunny," I called back. "There's a conversation we started this morning that I think we should finish." I had a fair amount of time to think about what I wanted to say before I reached Bunny's room. It didn't help. When I got there, I was still as much at a loss of how to express my thoughts as when I started out.
