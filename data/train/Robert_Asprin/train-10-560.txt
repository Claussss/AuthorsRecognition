   Aahz untied Glenda to wake her up, pouched the rope, and we all went out into the kitchen area to have Harold cook us horse steaks covered in tomatoes. He called it his celebration breakfast. He said he had it every month after the last full moon night.    I had to admit, it was surprisingly good.           After breakfast the talk turned to escape, which, after the      boring day and the fear of cow vampires all night, was the most interesting topic I could imagine.
