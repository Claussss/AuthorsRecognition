I was still trying to convince myself of this when I reached the Queen's chambers. The honor guard standing outside her door snapped to attention, and it was too late for a graceful retreat. Moving with a casualness I didn't feel, I knocked on her door. "Who is it?" "It's Skeeve, Your Majesty. I was wondering if I might speak to you if it's not inconvenient?" There was a pause, long enough for me to get my hope up, and then the door opened.
