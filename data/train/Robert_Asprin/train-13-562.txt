If you ain't holdin' anything better than you're showing, you best get out while you still got some skin left."    "There's one more card before the buy," said Tay-Shun, unfluttered. "Plenty of time to get better. Cal!." The call went around the table and Asho dealt the remaining players one card each, face down. "All right, pay dirt!" said Tay-Shun, peeking at the card he'd gotten.
