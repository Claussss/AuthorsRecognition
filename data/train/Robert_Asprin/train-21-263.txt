Food was definitely low on my list of priorities at the moment. If anything, I was more concerned with things going the other way through my digestive tract. It did however, suddenly occur to me that I was thirsty. In fact, VERY thirsty. "Have you got any juice on that tray?" I managed weakly, not wanting to sit up far enough to look myself. "Do you want orange or tomato?" The mention of tomato juice brought memories of last night's Bloody Marys to mind, and my stomach did a slow roll and dip to the left.
