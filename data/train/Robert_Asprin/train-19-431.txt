The attention their lovers pay them is their reassurance. But you should look again, Lalo-that's not all your pictures show." Blinking, he focused on the shaded backgrounds with which he had surrounded his sketches, and realized that they were more than random lines. It was not only the portraits that showed fear-the fears themselves were pictured on the page. He shook his head in pity, understanding now what had made the faces that way.
