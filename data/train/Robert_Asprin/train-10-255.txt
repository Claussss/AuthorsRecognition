   The problem I had right now was that I wasn't sure I could      solve any of my problems.    I went down the street to Audry's, tipping my hat to the guy with the shovel who was back in the street picking up after the horses. My old bartender friend and employer from yesterday had the door to Audry's open and the shutters retracted. I was the first customer.    "Didn't find her, huh?" he asked as I entered.
