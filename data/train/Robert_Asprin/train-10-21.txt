   I looked at Aahz and nodded.    "Maybe. But I don't know how he could have."    Aahz waved his hand in disgust.    "Apprentice, there are a thousand ways, especially with someone so unpracticed as you."    I said nothing. No point in even trying to defend my tal     ents. Aahz always won those conversations by making me try      something I couldn't yet do. And that was just about everything when it came to magik. But making disguises is my best ability.
