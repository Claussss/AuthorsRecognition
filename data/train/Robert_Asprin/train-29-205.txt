I'll let her go when I've got Crit, hear me? You want a favor out of us, we want one out of you. Fair trade." Prolonged silence. "Fair trade," he yelled at her. "Damn-lit!" "A remarkable day," she said. "So many people want favors of me. And magic comes so dear nowadays. You don't want me. You want a fortune-teller. A finder of lost objects. Surely you can find one down at the bazaar with the jugglers and the mimes."
