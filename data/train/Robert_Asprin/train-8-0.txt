  Robert Asprin   M.Y.T.H. Inc In Action Author's Note:    I am not a fast writer,    I am not a slow writer,    I am a half fast writer!    R. L. ASPRIN    THE FAN MAIL I've received has been pretty much split on the subject of my last Introduction; some found it interesting and insightful, while others thought it was boring and a waste. If you are of the latter group, please feel free to jump ahead directly into the story, since there is nothing in this message you need to know to understand (and, hopefully, enjoy) the book.
