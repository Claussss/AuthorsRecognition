"Thank you, Marissa. I think you're right." She took a sip of wine, letting the liquid numb her mouth, enjoying the sensation of it sliding down her throat. "Cade's really getting to you, huh?" Marissa said with a raised eye- brow. "Oh, that man. I don't understand him." Sarah's voice dropped to a whisper. "He frightens me." Marissa laughed. "He frightens everyone," she answered, "even Targ." "I can't believe that." Sarah considered the notion that anyone or anything could frighten Marissa's strange mercenary and found it ludi- crous. As ludicrous as, well, as thinking anything scared Cade.
