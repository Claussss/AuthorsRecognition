I mean, I'll need some time to think about it."    "Okay," Hemlock nods. "That's fair."    "Maybe in a year ..."    "... I'll give you a month," the queen sez, actin' like the Boss hadn't said anythin'. "Then I'll expect your answer one way or the other. In the meantime, I'll order the army to stop and you can start going over the books with Grimble. I mean, that will be a good idea whatever decision you make, won't it?"
