   "Well, then," I smiled, "we should probably be hooking up with him ASAP instead of standing here in the street arguing."    The Kid rolled his eyes melodramatically and set off marching down the road again.    Skeeve has changed a lot in the years I've worked with him. When we first met, he was a kid. Now, he's a young man... even though I still tend to think of him as "the Kid." Old habits die hard. He's grown from a gangly boy into a youth who has to shave... even though it's only necessary occasionally, so he tends to forget until Bunny reminds him. Even more astonishing is how much he's gained in confidence and poise to a point where he's acquired a certain amount of style. All in all, it's been interesting watching my young charge develop over the last few years. I just wish I felt better about the directions he's been developing in.
