It'll take them a while to get ready-but you still shouldn't be here."    "Well, what are you doing here?" Aahz challenged. "You don't look like a soldier to me."    "My dad's an officer," the youth yawned. "If a Ta-hoer patrol finds me out here, I'll just tell â€˜em who my father is and they'll keep their mouths shut."
