   That's what we were waiting for.    "Now, Ajax!" I hissed. "Arch â€˜em high."    "I remember, youngster," the archer grinned. "I'm ready when you are."    I waited until he raised his bow, then concentrated an intense beam of energy at a point a few inches in front of his bow.    It was like the candle-lighting exercise, and it worked as well now as it had when we had tried it last night.    As each shaft sped from Ajax's bow, it burst into flames and continued on its flight.
