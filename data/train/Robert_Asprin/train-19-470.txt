"How did you know that if we all closed our eyes and visualized the amplifier vanishing it would disappear?" asked the priest curiously. "It had no power of itself. Amplifying images and emotions was all it could do-it seemed worth a try." With an effort Lalo kept his features impassive. Better not reveal how terrified he had been that his plan would not work, or backfire. But that was over. Now his thoughts were quiet, like the city as it forgot its nightmares and returned to life's waking dream.
