"That's some local guy who looks like Rev, is all."    "I guess you're right," said Do-Wop. "Damn, he's a dead ringer, though."    "Hey, it could be worse," said Sushi.    "How's that?" asked Do-Wop, frowning.    "The guy could look like you, " said Sushi, grinning. He ducked as Do-Wop threw a punch in mock indignation. Just then, the line moved up, and the laughing group of legionnaires edged closer to their ride.
