    being held to what the map called a large ballroom. Clearly      the map's designers had planned on continuing the game right      to the very last room. It sort of made sense. Dimension to      dimension until we found the right one, then town to town      until we found the right one, now room to room until we found      the right one. I didn't much like the game, but I understood      the thinking.
