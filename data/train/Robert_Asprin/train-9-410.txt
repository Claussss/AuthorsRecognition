   "Ah! Here we are."    I was pulled out of my musings by the record keeper's exclamation at Gretta's return. I felt my anticipation rise as he took the offered folder and began perusing its contents.  For the first time since arriving on Perv, I was going to have a solid lead on how to find Aahz. Then I noticed he was frowning.    "What's wrong?"    "I'm sorry, Mr. Skeeve," the record keeper said, glancing up from the folder. "It seems we don't have a current address for your associate. The note here says Traveling.' I guess that, realizing his financial situation, we haven't been as diligent about keeping track of him as we've been with our other alumni."
