   "So how come they aren't inside like everything else?" I asked as Tanda gave me more water and a little bit of a snack to eat.    "You're asking me?" she said. "Maybe they're not bothered by whatever worries the people around here."    That made sense, in an odd sort of way.    "Maybe they are what worries the residents," I said, star     ing into the deep pits of eyes of the closest cow.    Both Aahz and Tanda laughed as if that was the funniest thing I had ever said.
