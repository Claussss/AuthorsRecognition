"Tell you what, Ivan..." "All right, you two! Hand 'em over!" The two men spun to face the source of the interruption. A youth was standing on the sidewalk behind them; he must have either followed them or been waiting in the bushes. His voice was firm, but the gun in his hand wavered as he tried to cover the two men. "C'mon! Give!" The boy's voice cracked. "Steady fella, we're giving." Fred reached for his wallet, taking care to move slowly. If the kid had a knife he might have tried taking him, but he had a healthy respect for guns, particularly when they were held by nervous amateurs.
