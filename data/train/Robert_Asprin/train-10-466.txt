   "Can you make it a little farther, Glenda?" Aahz asked.    Glenda jerked and pushed herself to her feet, leaning against the wall.    "I can make it as far as I need to make it."    Aahz just nodded.  "Then let's go."    Tanda had the torch, so I went to the wall and pushed where the secret panel was supposed to be and surprise, surprise, the wall opened. I slid through. At first I thought there was nothing on the other side of the panel, that the map had lied to us. Then I realized that the secret door was pushing out a massive drape or tapestry of some type.
