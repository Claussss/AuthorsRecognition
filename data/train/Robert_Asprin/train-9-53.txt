   "Well, let's see then. Could you share some of the things you've heard about this dimension with me?" Kalvin shrugged.    "If you want. I remember hearing about how one of your buddy's fellow citizens ripped off some guy's head and spit down his throat... literally!"    I ducked around a heavyset couple who were bearing down on me.    "Uh-huh. I heard the same rumor, but the one doing the ripping was a Troll, not a Pervect. Nobody actually saw that one, either. Besides, right now I'm more interested in information about the dimension than hearing tales of individual exploits."
