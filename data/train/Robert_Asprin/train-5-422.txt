   "You're awfully proud of that dead card," he said thoughtfully. "All right. I'll call. Pot's right."    Two more cards floated onto the table face up. I got a ten! The ten of clubs, to be specific. That canceled his ten and made my seven live again.    The Kid got the unicorn of hearts. Wild card! Now I had ten-seven high against his pair of tens showing.    Terrific.    "I won't try to kid you." My opponent smiled. "A pair of tens is worth ... twenty thousand."
