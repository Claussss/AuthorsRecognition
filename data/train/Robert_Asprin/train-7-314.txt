   That made sense. It was nice to see the Kid hadn't completely lost his feel for people.    "So what are you going to chew them out over? Their treatment of Quigley?"    He shook his head.    "Out of character," he said. "Quigley isn't the type to make a fuss over himself. No, I figured to make the fight the key issue."    "Fight? What fight?"    "The one that's about to break out on the field," Quigley/Skeeve grinned. "The way I see it, these two teams have been rivals for over five hundred years. I can't believe all their old grudges have been forgotten just because the government's changed."
