The second ready light came on. This time from Tur-Kam and Heem's ship. The period of waiting was nearly over. Zur started to continue, but I held up my hand for silence. While his points were interesting to ponder in inactive time, I did not want any distractions when we finally entered into battle. The third light remained unlit. It occurred to me it would be ironic if the final assault against the Coalition failed because of a malfunctioning ready light.
