   Flattening against the wall beside the door, the guard drew his weapon, then reached out and put his hand over the peephole used to check visitors. It was an old trick, and a normal precaution against someone shooting through the door when they saw the dot of light visible from the other side change as someone looked through.    Nothing happened.    Moving carefully, the guard slowly turned the doorknob, then threw the door open with a jerk.
