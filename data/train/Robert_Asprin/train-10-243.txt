   I desperately wanted to ask him what the full moon had to      do with anything, and what a round-up was, but he said both      so matter-of-factly that I knew I would blow my cover if I asked.    "Yeah, couldn't be that." I said instead.    "She was askin' about horses," he said. "Maybe she got one and headed down the road?"    I shook my head. "I checked. She didn't. Mind if I just sit over there and wait?"
