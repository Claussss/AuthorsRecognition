   An image flashed in my mind. It was a view of me, Skeeve, court magician, bolting for safety while Aahz faced the dragon alone. Something snapped in my mind.    "You go!" I snapped.    "Kid, are you-"    "It's my war and my job," I shouted. "Now get going."    With that I turned to face the oncoming dragon, not knowing or caring if Aahz followed my orders. I was Skeeve!    But it was an awfully big dragon!
