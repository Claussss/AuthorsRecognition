   "Thank you, guard," I said loftily, and hammered on the door with my fist.    "Further," the guard observed, "the general left word that you were to go right in."    The fact that he had withheld that bit of information until after I had knocked indicated that the guards hadn't completely abandoned their low regard for magicians. They were simply finding more subtle ways of being annoying.    I realized Aahz was getting ready to start a new round with the guard, so I hastily opened the door and entered, forcing him to follow.
