   "... And up twenty."    The Kid's smile faded. His eyes flicked quickly to my cards, then he nodded. "Call."    No comment. No witty banter. I had him thinking.    The next cards were en route. The three of hearts slid into my lineup. A dead card. Opposing it, the Kid got...    The ten of hearts!    I was now looking at three tens against my ten-seven high! For a moment my resolve wavered, but I shored it up again. I was in too far to change now.
