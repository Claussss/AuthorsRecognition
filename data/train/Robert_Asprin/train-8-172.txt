Ifs only garrison duty, but it's the only thing available right now. I figure that anything more they need to learn, you can help them pick up on the job. That's all ... Sergeant Guido."    It takes me a minute to register he is addressin' me by my new rank, but I manage to come to attention and salute before turnin' to go.
