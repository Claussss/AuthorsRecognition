"But the Gyskouras will be Molin Torchholder's child in the temple...." "Many men hope and sacrifice, Illyra, but there can only be one Gyskouras. It is not yet decided. One child or the other must die before the Gyskouras can emerge to be among  men before becoming  a god. You  have loved your  son. If you can't free him from the gyskourem web, then kill him before it is too late for us  all S'danzo and suvesh."
