"I assumed that each day is payable in advance, considering the interest rates," I said calmly. "Oh, yes, I'd like a receipt for that, as well."    The desk clerk whisked the form from under my pen and glanced at it almost before I had finished signing it.  "Quite right, Mr... Skeeve. I'll have a receipt for you in a moment."
