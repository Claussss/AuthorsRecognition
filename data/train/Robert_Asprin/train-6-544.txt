   "I've got to talk to you two," I shouted over the din.    "Shouldn't we go inside where it's quieter?" Grimble shouted back.    "We'll talk here!" I insisted.    "But the crowd ..." the chancellor gestured.    I turned and nodded to a figure in the front row of the mob. He responded by raising his right arm in a signal. In response, the men in the forefront of the crowd locked arms and formed a circle around us, moving with near military precision. In a twinkling, there was a space cleared in the teeming populace, with the advisors, Aahz, Gleep, myself, and the man who had given the signal standing alone at its center.
