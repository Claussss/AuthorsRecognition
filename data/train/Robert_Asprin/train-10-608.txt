"Just enough, with a good connection spell, to hook other nearby gold into the blockage. Maybe something gold-plated and flat."    "A golden shovel?" I asked.    Tanda nodded.  "That would do it, I'm sure."    Harold moved over toward the front door of the suite, near where the grass was planted. He tapped a spot on the wall and a closet door opened. He reached inside and pulled out a golden shovel, just like the ones the palace guys had. It seemed that, in the palace, no cow droppings could be picked up with anything but a golden shovel.
