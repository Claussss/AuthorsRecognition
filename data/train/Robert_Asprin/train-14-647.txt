   Strangely enough, though it was the most commonly fenced weapon, foil was the Eagles' weakest event. Normally O'Donnel would have fenced that weapon, being the second best fencer in the unit behind Corbin, who would, of course, fence saber. That would have possibly brought the competition to a close after only two bouts, without having to field their weakest fencer. As it was, Jester had boxed him into fencing pe, and there was a chance it would all come down to the third and final bout. The problem there was that pe was an "iffy" weapon. If your point control was not clicking or your timing was a hair off...
