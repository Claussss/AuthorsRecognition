barmaid in her fifties was serving  a corner booth. As Samlor entered,  the host thrust through the hangings behind the bar with a cask on his shoulder. Samlor had  sheathed his  knife. He  nodded to  the brawny  innkeeper and ducked beneath the bar himself. 'Hey!' cried the host. 'It's all right,' Samlor muttered. He slipped behind the hangings. A stone staircase, lighted  halfway by an oil  lamp, led down into  the cellars.
