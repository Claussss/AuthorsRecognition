   With a twitch of my mind, I summoned the pike. Without turning to look, I brought it arrowing over my shoulder in a course destined to embed it in the general's chest.    The general saw it coming and paled. He took an awkward step backward, realized it was too late for flight, and groped madly for his axe.    I stopped the pike three feet from his chest, floating it in front of him with its point leveled at his heart.
