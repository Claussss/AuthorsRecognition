Wait'll the Big Boys hear how good dumb muscle is against magik!"   He paused to kick the groaner in the side.   "Groan quieter! Mister Skeeve and I have some talking to do."   Having already completed one adventure after antagonizing the military arm of a large organization, I was not overly eager to add another entire group of plug-uglies to my growing list of enemies.
