"Hush, Notable, damn it, I told you to be qui-oh. I thought aloud, didn't I?" Notable made no comment. He was only an unusually large and unusually smart cat, although once he had been a man. Abruptly his human seemed to disappear, and in some shock the cat had to spend a second or three finding him- He blinked pupils gone huge and round as a pigeon's eggs as he stared up at the lean man in black, who was ascending a brick wall in a way that could have been used as training for frightened kittens. Unfrightened, Notable followed. He was almost as quiet, almost as competent at wall-climbing. Almost.
