  I was suddenly aware why nobody we met in our dimension-crawling ever wanted to tangle with a Pervect. I was also aware that someone had just walked into the room behind me.   "Rupert!"   "Uncle Aahz!"   The two pounded each other on the back. I gave them lots of room.   "Hey kid, this is my nephew Rupert... but I see you've already met."   "Unfortunately," I grumbled.   That earned me a black look from Rupert, but Aahz missed it completely.
