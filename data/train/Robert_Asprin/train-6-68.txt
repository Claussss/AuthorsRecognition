Now lower the sideburns... okay, build up the nose... narrow it... make the eyebrows bushier ... no, change ‘em back and sink the eyes a little instead ... for crying out loud change the eye color! Make ‘em brown... okay, now a couple of frown wrinkles in the middle of the forehead.... Good. That should do it."
