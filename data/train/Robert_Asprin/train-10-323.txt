   In the pastures along both sides of the road animals were      grazing. When I finally had to stop to rest, a number of the grazing animals looked up at us, big eyes glowing in the moonlight. They almost looked surprised to see us.    "Cows," Tanda said, pointing at the large creatures staring      at us from the field.    They looked fat and heavy, with white and dark areas over      their bodies. In the half-darkness, they seemed almost sinister with their big eyes and long ears.
