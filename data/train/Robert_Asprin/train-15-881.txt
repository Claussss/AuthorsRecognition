"Seems to be? Is it approaching, or isn't it?"    "I dunno, sir," said the legionnaire, pouting. "Whyn't you take a look if you think you can tell any more than I can?"    "I'll do just that," snarled Botchup, and he elbowed the legionnaire out of the seat and slid in. The legionnaire said nothing but began sidling toward the exit.
