   Any sarcasm I had managed to load into my voice was lost on Aahz, which is not surprising when you realize we were talking about money.    "A loan, eh?" he said thoughtfully. "What were the terms?"    "Tell him. Bunny."    "BUNNY??"    "Hey! You weren't there, remember? I decided to see what our accountant could do. Bunny?"    "Well, I've never dealt with stake money before, no pun intended, so I had to kind of feel my way along. I think I got us a pretty good arrangement, though."
