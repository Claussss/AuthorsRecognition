   "Then what happened?" Tanda asked.    "Didn't even make it into town," she said. "Got picked up      by a bunch of guys on horses yesterday and tossed in here. Then last night I got hauled out to be a snack at the big party upstairs."    Her hand again went to her neck and she flinched.  The red marks there didn't look like they were healing very well. And I didn't much like the sound of being a snack like those people lined up on the road had been.
