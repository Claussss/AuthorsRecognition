   In the courtyard below the window, Gleep was running in      circles chasing his tail. Thank heavens he wasn't near anything, because when a dragon started chasing his tail, things got knocked down, trampled, and just flat destroyed. Especially when it was young dragon.    What was even more amazing was that Aahz didn't seem to be noticing what Gleep was doing. Clearly the map meant      something to him.
