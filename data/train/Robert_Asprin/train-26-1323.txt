Thieves' World! My title went on the second volume. (Send your proposed title for the next one; Bob and Lynn just adore mail and  if your title is chosen,  you will receive  a genuine certified  Thing. Maybe a  no prize for you if  you're one of my  fellow comics fans.... If  you're runner-up, your prize is a date-nocturnal only-with  either Tarkle or Roxane, Zip or  Ouleh the Man-killer; your choice.
