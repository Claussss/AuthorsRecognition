   "I hear you drink," she said bluntly, breaking the silence.    "Not well... and, after last night, not often," I returned.    That earned me a curt nod.    "Good. A girl's got to watch her reputation." It never even occurred to me that she might be referring to her way with me. She was stating quite simply that if anything happened to me while she was on guard, her professional status would suffer. What's more, she didn't want to risk that reputation on a fool. As one inclined to talk too much, I was impressed with how much she could communicate with so few words.
