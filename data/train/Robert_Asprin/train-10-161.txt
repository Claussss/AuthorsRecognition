    scooted over to get a better look as well.    Again the map had changed.    No surprise there. We were on Vortex #6, which was now      clearly highlighted on the map. There were four lines from our      dimension headed to four different places. I didn't like the sounds of the four dimensions at all.    Febrile was the one on the right, Hostile the next one, Durst      the next, and Molder the farthest left.
