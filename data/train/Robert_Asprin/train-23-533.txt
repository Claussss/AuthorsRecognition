"Well," Hairy began confidently, "first we demand the right to choose our own captain. Even though we'll probably elect him from within our own crew, we want copies of your personnel files to see who else might be available and what their qualifications are.

Finally, we want your signature on an order to execute Egor for gross abuse of the authorities of a captain."
