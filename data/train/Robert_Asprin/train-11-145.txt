   "Sleep?" I gasped. "What about Tanda?"    "What about her?" Aahz frowned.    "They're holding her prisoner in Jahk!" I exclaimed. "Aren't we going to try to rescue her?"    "Oh, that!" my mentor laughed. "Don't worry about her. She'll be along on her own in a little while."    "But they're holding her prisoner!" I insisted.    "You think so?" Aahz grinned. "Stop and think a minute, kid. How are they going to hold her? Remember, she can hop dimensions any time she wants. The only reason she didn't come back at the same time you did is that she got knocked cold. As soon as she wakes up, she'll be back. Mark my words."
