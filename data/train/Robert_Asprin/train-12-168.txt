   like a battery so that it's there when you need it. While    we've been talking, I've been charging up, so I can pro-    vide a bit of magical cover as needed. Now, I won't be    able to do anything prolonged like a constant disguise    spell, and what I've got I'll want to use carefully    because it'll take a while to recharge after each use, but    we won't be relying on your jewelry completely."
