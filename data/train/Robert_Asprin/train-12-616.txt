  Despite my resolve to settle this thing amicably, I was    starting to get annoyed.   "First of all, he's not my pet demon. He's my partner    and his name is Aahz. Secondly, I didn't send him. He    knocked me out cold and came himself. Third and final,    he was never out to kill you. He was trying to bring you    and your cohorts back to Deva so we wouldn't get stuck    paying off the people you swindled plus a hefty fine.
