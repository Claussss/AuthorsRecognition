   I studied the moving blue lines with everyone else, watch     ing how they seemed to come up out of the floor plan of the castle and into the air.    The map was magik, so it even showed the different levels      of the castle, like looking into a fishbowl. It was both beautiful and disconcerting at the same time.    "Look in the sub-level of the castle," Tanda said, pointing.    I let my eyes adjust so that I could see the plan of the castle that far down. I instantly saw what she was pointing at. The wide, thick river of energy that was pouring up from the ground suddenly thinned, like a good part of it had been drained away into an unseen drain. That unseen drain, using that much energy, could only be a spell large enough to control an entire dimension.
