   I am reflectin' on this when a broad elbows her way in next to me at the bar. At first I think she is just really desperate for a drink, which as I said is understandable considerin' the slow service, and step aside, usin' my not inconsiderable bulk to make room for her.    "Got my target picked out for me?"    It takes a second for me to realize that I am the one this question is bein' addressed to, as she sez it casual without lookin' at me direct.
