"When the average person thinks of an actor, a politician, or an athlete, they always view them within the context of their specialty. The thought that they must occasionally perform some very ordinary tasks such as shining shoes or doing the laundry never enters into the picture." "That's true," Erickson admitted. "I guess it's just a matter of ego-defense."
