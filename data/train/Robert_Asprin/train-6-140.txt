   The general bared his teeth.    "The drawing is to scale," he said pointedly. "Perhaps now you will realize the magnitude of the task before you."    My mind balked at accepting his statement.    "Really, General," I chided. "Surely you're overstating the case. There aren't enough fighting men in any kingdom to form a front that long."    "Magician," the general's voice was menacing, "I did not reach my current rank by overstating military situations. The army you are facing is one of the mightiest forces the world has ever seen. It is the striking arm of a rapidly growing empire situated far to the north. They have been advancing for three years now, absorbing smaller kingdoms and crushing any resistance offered. All able-bodied men of conquered lands are conscripted for military service, swelling their ranks to the size you see indicated on the map. The only reason they are not advancing faster is that in addition to limitless numbers of men, they possess massive war machines which, though effective, are slow to transport."
