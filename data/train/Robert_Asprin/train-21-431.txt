"I guess I figure that it would pretty much be a marriage in name only, with her going her way and me going mine." "Good," the troll said emphatically. "Good?" I echoed. "Com'on, Chumley." "Good in that you aren't expecting anything. You aren't going into it with the notion of reforming her, or that she'd give up her throne to hover around you adoringly, or any one of a myriad of other false hopes or assumptions that most grooms have on the way to the altar."
