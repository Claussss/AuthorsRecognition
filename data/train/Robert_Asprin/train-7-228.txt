   "Hiya, Geek," I said, easin' up to his table. "Mind if I join ya?"    He blinked his eyes a couple times tryin' ta focus â€˜em before he realized that the person talkin' to him really was that big.    "Well, well, well. If it isn't one of the M.Y.T.H. Inc. hotshots. What brings you to this neck of the woods, Massha? Slumming?"    I pulled up a chair so's I could sit close to him. I mean, he hadn't said no, and that's about as close to an invitation as I usually get.
