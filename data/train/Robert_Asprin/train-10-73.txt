    "But your offer is fair and I will accept. I assume you need to      go to Vortex #1 first?"      "Yes,"      both Aahz and Tanda said at the same time.      The creature, now shifting back into a beautiful woman again, nodded. "That can be arranged."    She looked at Aahz and Tanda with a serious look. Her voice was firm and very solid. "Since I have a financial stake now in what you are attempting, I must warn you that a Vortex dimension is not a place to take lightly. It is a very dangerous, and sometimes tempting, place. It will be very easy to miss your path and become lost."
