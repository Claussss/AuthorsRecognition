   Tanda tumbled across the floor toward the door, coming      to rest pressed against the wood. Her eyes were closed and I      couldn't tell if she was hurt or not.    Aahz was pressed against the stone wall beside me.    Forces like I had never felt before held me in position as      the gold cut through the flow just as we had planned. So far it was working. I couldn't believe it.    But then the shovel kept growing and growing as more and more gold poured into it. Something was wrong. Tanda should have unlinked the gold in the shield we built from the other gold around the area when the shield hit the energy. But there was clearly still more and more gold pouring into that shield. It had cut the side-flow, but now it was falling slowly toward the main flow, cutting into it as well as it kept growing.
