Thieves' World story for pay. You write your second for revenge. I got into this  project as a result  of a panel at  a convention, in which  the remarks from one end and the other of the table ran: ASPRIN: I asked C. J. here to write for Thieves' World and she turned me down. CHERRYH: You did not. ASPRIN: (feigning puzzlement) I didn't? CHERRYH: You never did. ASPRIN: (more and more innocent) I thought I did.
