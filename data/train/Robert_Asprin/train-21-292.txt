"You know, Boss," Nunzio smiled, "folks say that, after a while, pets start takin' on the traits of their masters and vice verses. Takin' that into consideration, I think it's only logical that Gleep here acts a bit strange from time to time." For some reason, that brought to mind my earlier conversation with Bunny. "Tell me, Nunzio, do you think I've been drinking too much lately?" "That's not for me to say, Boss," he said easily. "I'm just a bodyguard, not a babysitter."
