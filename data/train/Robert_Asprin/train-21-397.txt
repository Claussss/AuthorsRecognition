After a few long moments of stillness, the door opened again. "You can come in now, Boss," my bodyguard announced. "They're gone." I left my post by the wall and re-entered my room. A quick glance around was all it took to confirm my bodyguard's claim. The Djins had departed for destinations unknown. Surprisingly enough, my immediate reaction was to be a little hurt that they hadn't bothered to say goodbye.
