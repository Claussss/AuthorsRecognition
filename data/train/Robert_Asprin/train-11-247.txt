   "That's not a bad plan," I said judiciously, "but I can see three things wrong with it. First, we don't have a thousand with us to bet..."    "We could hop back to Klah and get it," Aahz countered.    "Second, we don't have the time..."    "It wouldn't take that long," my mentor protested.    "Third, if our mission's successful, there won't be a war."    Aahz's mouth was open for a response, and that's where it stayed-open, and blissfully noiseless as he thought about my argument.
