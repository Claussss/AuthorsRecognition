   "No, but I've heard of it. Most Djins I know avoid it like the plague."    So much for getting my hopes up. Still, at least I had Kalvin talking seriously for a change.    "Well, to answer your question, I'm here looking for a friend of mine. He... well, you might say he ran away from home, and I want to find him and bring him back.  The trouble is, he's... a bit upset at the moment."    "A bit upset?" The Djin grimaced. "Sahib, he sounds positively suicidal. Nobody in their right mind comes to Perv voluntarily... present company excepted, of course.  Do you have any idea why he headed this way?"
