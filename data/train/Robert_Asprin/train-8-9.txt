   I can see the guy with the questions has noticed this all by himself, since he keeps glancin' back and forth between the two of us as he jots down my responses.    "Next of kin?"    "I guess that would be Nunzio, here," I sez, jerkin' a thumb at my colleague.    "You two are related?"    "He's my cousin."    For a second I think he's about to say somethin' more, but then he just shrugs and scribbles a little more on his pad.
