   "Well, would you look at that?" Aahz said, stunned.    Tanda studied the map, then looked at the wall near Glenda's bunk, then studied the map again.    It didn't take me long to see what she was doing. The      map showed a way out of this room that wasn't the main door. Maybe, just maybe, we had a chance. If we could escape the cell, then avoid hundreds of men with white robes and golden shovels, and then outrun the posse on horseback, we might be able to get far enough away from the castle to dimension-hop back to Vortex #6.
