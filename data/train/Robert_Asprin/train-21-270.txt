"I ...I don't know what to say, Bunny. I mean, sure, I drink. But everybody drinks a little from time to time." "A little?" She came off the windowsill in one easy motion and came to perch on the edge of my bed. "Skeeve, every time I see you lately you've got a goblet of wine in your hand. It's gotten so that your idea of saying 'Hello' to someone is to offer them a drink." I was really confused now. When she first mentioned my drinking, my immediate reaction was that she was being an alarmist. The more she talked, however, the more I found myself wondering if she might have a point.
