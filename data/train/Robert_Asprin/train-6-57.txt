   "Really?" I said, genuinely interested. "Did they get Garkin's brazier?"    "Brazier?" My mentor frowned.    "You remember," I prompted. "You used it to drink wine out of when you first arrived."    "That's right! Yeah, I think I saw it in there. Why?"    "No special reason," I replied innocently. "It was always a favorite of mine, that's all."    From watching Garkin back in my early apprentice days, I knew there were secrets to that brazier I was dying to learn. I also knew that, if possible, I wanted to save it as a surprise for Aahz.
