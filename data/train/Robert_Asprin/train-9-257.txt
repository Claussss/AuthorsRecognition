   I topped off my glass casually, hoping the Djin wouldn't notice how fast I was drinking the stuff.  "Questions like... ?"    "Well, like... What are friends... really? On the rare occasions the subject comes up, all people seem to talk about is the need to be needed. All of a sudden I'm not sure I know what that means."    Somehow, my glass had gotten empty again. I refilled it as I continued.    "The more I look at it, the more I think that if you really need your friends, it's either a sign of weakness or laziness.  You either need or want people to do your thinking for you, or your fighting for you, or whatever. Things that by rights you should be able to do for yourself. By rights, that makes you a parasite, existing by leeching off other people's strength and generosity."
