   I'm thinking we got the fight in the bag, but one of the cops gets between 'em holdin' them apart with a hand on each of their chests.    "Back off! Both of you!" he orders. "We're going to get to the bottom of this ..."    "GET YOUR HANDS OFF THAT SOLDIER!!"    The Military Police have arrived and come pushin' through the crowd to join our discussion group.    "Military personnel are to be handled by the MPs and not pushed around by some cop with a chip on his shoulder!"
