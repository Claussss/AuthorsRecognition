I recall one conversation in particular that surprised me, as it transcended not only caste lines, but chain of command as well. "A word with you, Commander, if you have a moment?" "Certainly, Rahk." Rahk was the junior of the three Scientists, and I had had little contact with him since his outburst when the fortification first landed. "I have a theory I would like you to consider, Commander. One which I think has not been previously brought to your attention."
