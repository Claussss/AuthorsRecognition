   "Excuse me, sir?"    The general turned from staring out the window to find an aide poised in the door of his office.    "You asked to be notified as soon as Colonel Battleax left on her vacation," the aide said without formality. Salutes, like views, were optional in the Legion, and therefore very rare indeed.    "You're sure she's gone? You saw her take off yourself?"    "Well, sir, I saw her shuttle lift off and then return without her. The ship she had reservations on has left orbit, so I assume that she's on it."
