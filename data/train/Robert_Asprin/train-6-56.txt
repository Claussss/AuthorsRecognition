   Garkin's hut, where I had first been introduced to magik, had been full of candles, vials of strange powders, dusty books... now there was a magician's lair! Of course, I had since discovered most of what he had was unnecessary for the actual working of magik itself.    I was beginning to see what Aahz meant when he said I'd have to learn to put on a show.    "We've got a lot of stuff we can work into your presentation," Aahz continued. "Isstvan left a lot of his junk behind when he left. Oh, and you might find some familiar items when we unload. I think the Imps helped themselves to some of Garkin's equipment and brought it back to the inn with them."
