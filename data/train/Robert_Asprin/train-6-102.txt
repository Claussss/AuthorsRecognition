   Something in me snapped. Any fear I felt of the general and his axe evaporated, replaced by a heady glow of strength.    I had discovered on my first visit to the Bazaar at Deva that I didn't like to be pushed by big, loud Deveels. I discovered now that I also didn't like it any better when the arrogance came from a big, loud fellow Klahd.    So the big man wanted to throw his weight around, did he?
