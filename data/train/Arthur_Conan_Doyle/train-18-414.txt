I looked up, but nothing was to be seen. I examined the whole interior
of the tent carefully, but without discovering any cause for the strange
sound. At last, worn out with fatigue, I gave the mystery up, and
throwing myself on the couch was soon fast asleep. When I awoke this morning I was inclined to put the whole of my
yesternight's experiences down to imagination, but I was soon disabused
of the idea, for I had hardly risen before the same strange sound was
repeated in my very ear as loudly, and to all appearance as causelesly,
as before. What it is or where it comes from I cannot conceive. I have
not heard it since.
