      “Where are we going to now?” I asked, as we left the office.       “We are now going to interview Lord Holdhurst, the cabinet
      minister and future premier of England.”       We were fortunate in finding that Lord Holdhurst was still in his
      chambers in Downing Street, and on Holmes sending in his card we
      were instantly shown up. The statesman received us with that
      old-fashioned courtesy for which he is remarkable, and seated us
      on the two luxuriant lounges on either side of the fireplace.
      Standing on the rug between us, with his slight, tall figure, his
      sharp features, thoughtful face, and curling hair prematurely
      tinged with grey, he seemed to represent that not too common
      type, a nobleman who is in truth noble.
