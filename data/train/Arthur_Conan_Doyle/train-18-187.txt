I had little time, however, to observe the general's collection, since
the general himself lay upon the couch and was evidently in sore need of
my services. He was lying with his head turned half away from us. Breathing heavily,
and apparently unconscious of our presence. His bright, staring eyes and
the deep, hectic flush upon his cheek showed that his fever was at its
height. I advanced to the bedside, and, stooping over him, I placed my fingers
upon his pulse, when immediately he sprang up into the sitting position
and struck at me frenziedly with his clenched hands. I have never seen
such intensity of fear and horror stamped upon a human face as appeared
upon that which was now glaring up at me.
