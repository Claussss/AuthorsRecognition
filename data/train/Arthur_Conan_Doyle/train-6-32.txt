The Abbot was red with anger at this new offense. “I will teach him that
the servants of Holy Church, even though we of the rule of Saint Bernard
be the lowliest and humblest of her children, can still defend their own
against the froward and the violent! Go, cite this man before the Abbey
court. Let him appear in the chapter-house after tierce to-morrow.” But the wary sacrist shook his head: “Nay, holy father, the times are
not yet ripe. Give me three days, I pray you, that my case against him
may be complete. Bear in mind that the father and the grandfather of
this unruly squire were both famous men of their day and the foremost
knights in the King's own service, living in high honor and dying in
their knightly duty. The Lady Ermyntrude Loring was first lady to
the King's mother. Roger FitzAlan of Farnham and Sir Hugh Walcott of
Guildford Castle were each old comrades-in-arms of Nigel's father, and
sib to him on the distaff side. Already there has been talk that we have
dealt harshly with them. Therefore, my rede is that we be wise and wary
and wait until his cup be indeed full.”
