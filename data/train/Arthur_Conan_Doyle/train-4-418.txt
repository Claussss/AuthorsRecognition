‘Have you told the worthy minister,’ said I, ‘of your captivity amongst
the Mussulmans, and of the noble way in which you did uphold the
Christian faith at Stamboul?’ ‘Nay,’ cried our companion, ‘I would fain hear the tale. I marvel much
that one so faithful and unbending as thyself was ever let loose by the
unclean and bloodthirsty followers of Mahomet.’ ‘It does not become me to tell the tale,’ Saxon answered with great
presence of mind, casting at the same time a most venomous sidelong
glance at me. ‘It is for my comrades in misfortune and not for me to
describe what I endured for the faith. I have little doubt, Master
Pettigrue, that you would have done as much had you been there. The town
of Taunton lies very quiet beneath us, and there are few lights for so
early an hour, seeing that it has not yet gone ten. It is clear that
Monmouth’s forces have not reached it yet, else had there been some show
of camp-fires in the valley; for though it is warm enough to lie out in
the open, the men must have fires to cook their victual.’
