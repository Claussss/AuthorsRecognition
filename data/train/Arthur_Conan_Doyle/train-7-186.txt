“The Emir Abderrahman says that if you do not become Moslem, it is not
worth while delaying the whole caravan in order to carry you upon the
baggage-camels. If it were not for you, he says that we could travel
twice as fast. He wishes to know therefore, once for ever, if you
will accept the Koran.” Then in the same tone, as if he were still
translating, he continued: “You had far better consent, for if you do
not he will most certainly put you all to death.”
