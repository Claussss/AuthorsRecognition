Richardson was also the subtler and deeper writer, in my opinion. He
concerns himself with fine consistent character-drawing, and with a
very searching analysis of the human heart, which is done so easily,
and in such simple English, that the depth and truth of it only
come upon reflection. He condescends to none of those scuffles and
buffetings and pantomime rallies which enliven, but cheapen, many
of Fielding's pages. The latter has, it may be granted, a broader
view of life. He had personal acquaintance of circles far above, and
also far below, any which the douce citizen, who was his rival, had
ever been able or willing to explore. His pictures of low London
life, the prison scenes in "Amelia," the thieves' kitchens in
"Jonathan Wild," the sponging houses and the slums, are as vivid
and as complete as those of his friend Hogarth--the most British
of artists, even as Fielding was the most British of writers. But
the greatest and most permanent facts of life are to be found in
the smallest circles. Two men and a woman may furnish either the
tragedian or the comedian with the most satisfying theme. And so,
although his range was limited, Richardson knew very clearly and
very thoroughly just that knowledge which was essential for his
purpose. Pamela, the perfect woman of humble life, Clarissa, the
perfect lady, Grandison the ideal gentleman--these were the three
figures on which he lavished his most loving art. And now, after
one hundred and fifty years, I do not know where we may find more
satisfying types.
