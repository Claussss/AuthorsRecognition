“His name is Edward.” “Sir Edward Mortimer of Kent, perchance, or is it Sir Edward Brocas of
whom the Lady Ermyntrude talks?” “Nay, he is known as Edward only, and if you ask a second name it is
Plantagenet, for he who comes to seek the shelter of your roof is your
liege lord and mine, the King's high majesty, Edward of England.” 
VI. IN WHICH LADY ERMYNTRUDE OPENS THE IRON COFFER 
AS in a dream Nigel heard these stupendous and incredible words. As in
a dream also he had a vision of a smiling and conciliatory Abbot, of an
obsequious sacrist, and of a band of archers who cleared a path for him
and for the King's messenger through the motley crowd who had choked the
entrance of the Abbey court. A minute later he was walking by the side
of Chandos through the peaceful cloister, and in front in the open
archway of the great gate was the broad yellow road between its borders
of green meadow-land. The spring air was the sweeter and the more
fragrant for that chill dread of dishonor and captivity which had so
recently frozen his ardent heart. He had already passed the portal when
a hand plucked at his sleeve and he turned to find himself confronted by
the brown honest face and hazel eyes of the archer who had interfered in
his behalf.
