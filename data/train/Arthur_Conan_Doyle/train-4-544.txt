‘True! They have more ensigns than ever I saw with so small a force,’
Saxon answered, rising in his stirrups. ‘One or two are blue, and the
rest, as far as I can see for the sun shining upon them, are white, with
some motto or device.’ Whilst we had been conversing, the body of horse which formed the
vanguard of the Protestant army had approached within a quarter of a
mile or less of the town, when a loud, clear bugle-call brought them to
a halt. In each successive regiment or squadron the signal was repeated,
so that the sound passed swiftly down the long array until it died away
in the distance. As the coil of men formed up upon the white road, with
just a tremulous shifting motion along the curved and undulating line,
its likeness to a giant serpent occurred again to my mind.
