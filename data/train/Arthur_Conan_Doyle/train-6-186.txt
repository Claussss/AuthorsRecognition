Behind him, upon the little brown pony which had been Nigel's former
mount, rode Samkin Aylward the bowman, who had taken upon himself the
duties of personal attendant and body-guard. His great shoulders and
breadth of frame seemed dangerously top-heavy upon the tiny steed,
but he ambled along, whistling a merry lilt and as lighthearted as his
master. There was no countryman who had not a nod and no woman who had
not a smile for the jovial bowman, who rode for the most part with his
face over his shoulder, staring at the last petticoat which had passed
him. Once only he met with a harsher greeting. It was from a tall,
white-headed, red-faced man whom they met upon the moor.
