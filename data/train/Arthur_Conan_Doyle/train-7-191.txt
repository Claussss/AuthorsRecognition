“There's the pistol, Miss Adams,” said Belmont. “Give it here! We won't be tortured! We won't stand it!” “Offer them money, Mansoor! Offer them anything!” cried Stephens. “Look.
here, I'll turn Mohammedan if they'll promise to leave the women alone.

grey-bearded old devil that we know nothing about his cursed tinpot

expect us to adopt it until we know what particular brand of rot it is
that he wants us to believe. Tell him that if he will instruct us, we
are perfectly willing to listen to his teaching, and you can add that
any creed which turns out such beauties as him, and that other bounder
with the black beard, must claim the attention of every one.”
