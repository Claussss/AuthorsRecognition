A great stone lay embedded in the mud, and this I hurled over, but we
never heard thud or splash to show that it had reached the bottom. As we hung over the noisome chasm a sound did at last rise to our ears
out of its murky depths. High, clear, and throbbing, it tinkled for an
instant out of the abyss, to be succeeded by the same deadly stillness
which had preceded it. I did not wish to appear superstitious, or to put down to extraordinary
causes that which may have a natural explanation. That one keen note may
have been some strange water sound produced far down in the bowels of
the earth. It may have been that or it may have been that sinister bell
of which I had heard so much. Be this as it may, it was the only sign
that rose to us from the last terrible resting-place of the two who had
paid the debt which had so long been owing.
