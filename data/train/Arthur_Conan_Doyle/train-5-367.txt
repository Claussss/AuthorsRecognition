"It's no joke when the doctor of one of these isolated gunboats himself
falls ill," continues the surgeon after a pause.  "You might think it
easy for him to prescribe for himself, but this fever knocks you down
like a club, and you haven't strength left to brush a mosquito off your
face.  I had a touch of it at Lagos, and I know what I am telling you.
But there was a chum of mine who really had a curious experience.  The
whole crew gave him up, and, as they had never had a funeral aboard the
ship, they began rehearsing the forms so as to be ready.  They thought
that he was unconscious, but he swears he could hear every word that
passed.  'Corpse comin' up the latchway!' cried the Cockney sergeant of
Marines.  'Present harms!'  He was so amused, and so indignant too,
that he just made up his mind that he wouldn't be carried through that
hatchway, and he wasn't, either."
