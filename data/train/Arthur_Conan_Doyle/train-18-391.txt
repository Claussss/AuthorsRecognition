There is a smaller ravine which opens into the main pass, and in their
hurry and confusion some of the fugitives rushed down this. I saw sixty
or seventy of them turn down, but I should have passed them by and
continued in pursuit of the main body had not one of my scouts come
rustling up to inform me that the smaller ravine was a _cul-de-sac_, and
that the Afridis who had gone up it had no possible means of getting out
again except by cutting their way through our ranks.
