me on a subject connected with my own profession, so I made no comment,
but rose to take my departure. Before doing so I felt his pulse once

unaccountable fashion which is peculiar to these malarious types of

and stretched out my hand at the same time to pick my gloves from the
table, with the result that I raised not only my own property, but also
the linen cloth which was arranged over some object in the centre.
