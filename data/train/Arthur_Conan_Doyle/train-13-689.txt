      He walked past the couch to the open window, and held up the
      drooping stalk of a moss-rose, looking down at the dainty blend
      of crimson and green. It was a new phase of his character to me,
      for I had never before seen him show any keen interest in natural
      objects.       “There is nothing in which deduction is so necessary as in
      religion,” said he, leaning with his back against the shutters.
      “It can be built up as an exact science by the reasoner. Our
      highest assurance of the goodness of Providence seems to me to
      rest in the flowers. All other things, our powers our desires,
      our food, are all really necessary for our existence in the first
      instance. But this rose is an extra. Its smell and its colour are
      an embellishment of life, not a condition of it. It is only
      goodness which gives extras, and so I say again that we have much
      to hope from the flowers.”
