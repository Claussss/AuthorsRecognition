      “‘“I’d a partner,” said he, “a rare good man, as true as a stock
      to a barrel. He’s got the dibbs, he has, and where do you think
      he is at this moment? Why, he’s the chaplain of this ship—the
      chaplain, no less! He came aboard with a black coat, and his
      papers right, and money enough in his box to buy the thing right
      up from keel to main-truck. The crew are his, body and soul. He
      could buy ’em at so much a gross with a cash discount, and he did
      it before ever they signed on. He’s got two of the warders and
      Mercer, the second mate, and he’d get the captain himself, if he
      thought him worth it.”
