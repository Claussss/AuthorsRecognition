“Nay, Oliver, I cannot be with you, for I must to Montaubon this day.” “To Montaubon? But I have heard that your Company is to come with my
forty Winchester rascals to Dax.” “If you will take charge of them, Oliver. For I will go to Montaubon
with none save my two squires and two archers. Then, when I have found
the rest of my Company I shall lead them to Dax. We set forth this
morning.” “Then I must back to my pasty,” said Sir Oliver. “You will find us at
Dax, I doubt not, unless the prince throw me into prison, for he is very
wroth against me.”
