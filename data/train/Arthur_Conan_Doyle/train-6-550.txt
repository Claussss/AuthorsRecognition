“Nay, there are great happenings upon the sea, and many worthy people to
be found upon ships,” said Nigel. “In all parts, if one goes far enough
upon the water, one would find those whom it would be joy to meet. If
one crosses over the Narrow Sea, as we have done, we come on the French
who are so needful to us; for how else would we win worship? Or if
you go south, then in time one may hope to come to the land of the
unbelievers, where there is fine skirmishing and much honor for him who
will venture his person. Bethink you, archer, how fair a life it must
be when one can ride forth in search of advancement with some hope of
finding many debonair cavaliers upon the same quest, and then if one be
overborne one has died for the faith, and the gates of Heaven are open
before you. So also the sea to the north is a help to him who seeks
honor, for it leads to the country of the Eastlanders and to those parts
where the heathen still dwell who turn their faces from the blessed
Gospel. There also a man might find some small deeds to do, and by
Saint Paul! Aylward, if the French hold the truce and the good Sir John
permits us, I would fain go down into those parts. The sea is a good
friend to the cavalier, for it takes him where he may fulfil his vows.”
