      I cannot be sure of the exact date, for some of my memoranda upon
      the matter have been mislaid, but it must have been towards the
      end of the first year during which Holmes and I shared chambers
      in Baker Street. It was boisterous October weather, and we had
      both remained indoors all day, I because I feared with my shaken
      health to face the keen autumn wind, while he was deep in some of
      those abstruse chemical investigations which absorbed him utterly
      as long as he was engaged upon them. Towards evening, however,
      the breaking of a test-tube brought his research to a premature
      ending, and he sprang up from his chair with an exclamation of
      impatience and a clouded brow.
