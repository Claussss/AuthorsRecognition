It was all wonderfully clear, and yet disassociated from the rest of my
life, as the incidents of even the most vivid dream might be.  A
peculiar double consciousness possessed me.  There was the predominant
alien will, which was bent upon drawing me to the side of its owner,
and there was the feebler protesting personality, which I recognized as
being myself, tugging feebly at the overmastering impulse as a led
terrier might at its chain.  I can remember recognizing these two
conflicting forces, but I recall nothing of my walk, nor of how I was
admitted to the house.
