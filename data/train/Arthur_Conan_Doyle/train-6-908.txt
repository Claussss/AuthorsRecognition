William of Montaubon, the cunning squire, had made his way across to
the spot where the steeds were tethered, and had mounted his own great
roussin. At first it was thought that he was about to ride from the
field, but the howl of execration from the Breton peasants changed
suddenly to a yell of applause and delight as he turned the beast's head
for the English circle and thrust his long prick spurs into its side.
Those who faced him saw this sudden and unexpected appearance. Time was
when both horse and rider must have winced away from the shower of their
blows. But now they were in no state to meet such a rush. They could
scarce raise their arms. Their blows were too feeble to hurt this mighty
creature. In a moment it had plunged through the ranks, and seven of
them were on the grass. It turned and rushed through them again, leaving
five others helpless beneath its hoofs. No need to do more! Already
Beaumanoir and his companions were inside the circle, the prostrate men
were helpless, and Josselin had won.
