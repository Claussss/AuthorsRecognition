Well, I have bored you unduly, my patient friend, with my love of
memoirs, Napoleonic and otherwise, which give a touch of human
interest to the arid records of history. Not that history should
be arid. It ought to be the most interesting subject upon earth,
the story of ourselves, of our forefathers, of the human race, the
events which made us what we are, and wherein, if Weismann's views
hold the field, some microscopic fraction of this very body which
for the instant we chance to inhabit may have borne a part. But
unfortunately the power of accumulating knowledge and that of
imparting it are two very different things, and the uninspired
historian becomes merely the dignified compiler of an enlarged
almanac. Worst of all, when a man does come along with fancy and
imagination, who can breathe the breath of life into the dry bones,
it is the fashion for the dryasdusts to belabour him, as one who
has wandered away from the orthodox path and must necessarily be
inaccurate. So Froude was attacked. So also Macaulay in his day. But
both will be read when the pedants are forgotten. If I were asked
my very ideal of how history should be written, I think I should
point to those two rows on yonder shelf, the one M'Carthy's "History
of Our Own Times," the other Lecky's "History of England in the
Eighteenth Century." Curious that each should have been written by
an Irishman, and that though of opposite politics and living in an
age when Irish affairs have caused such bitterness, both should be
conspicuous not merely for all literary graces, but for that broad
toleration which sees every side of a question, and handles every
problem from the point of view of the philosophic observer and never
of the sectarian partisan.
