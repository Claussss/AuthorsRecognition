“I'd come after you, Jack.” “No, no, you shall come WITH me. If this valley is closed to me and
I can never come back, how can I leave you behind, and me perhaps in
hiding from the police with never a chance of a message? It's with me
you must come. I know a good woman in the place I come from, and it's
there I'd leave you till we can get married. Will you come?” “Yes, Jack, I will come.” “God bless you for your trust in me! It's a fiend out of hell that I
should be if I abused it. Now, mark you, Ettie, it will be just a word
to you, and when it reaches you, you will drop everything and come right
down to the waiting room at the depot and stay there till I come for
you.”
