And there was a change in the woman.  She no longer seemed small or
insignificant.  Twenty years were gone from her age.  Her eyes were
shining, a tinge of color had come into her sallow cheeks, her whole
figure had expanded.  So I have seen a dull-eyed, listless lad change
in an instant into briskness and life when given a task of which he
felt himself master.  She looked down at Agatha with an expression
which I resented from the bottom of my soul--the expression with which
a Roman empress might have looked at her kneeling slave.  Then with a
quick, commanding gesture she tossed up her arms and swept them slowly
down in front of her.
