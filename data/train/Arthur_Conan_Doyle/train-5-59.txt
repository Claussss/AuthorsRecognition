"It's my granduncle, sir," said Norah, casting down her eyes before the
keen, critical gaze of the young soldier.  "He is in the front parlour." "Could I have a word with him, miss?  I'll call again if it don't
chance to be convenient." "I am sure that he would be very glad to see you, sir.  He's in here,
if you'll step in.  Uncle, here's a gentleman who wants to speak with
you." "Proud to see you, sir--proud and glad, sir," cried the sergeant,
taking three steps forward into the room, and grounding his carbine
while he raised his hand, palm forwards, in a salute.  Norah stood by
the door, with her mouth and eyes open, wondering if her granduncle had
ever, in his prime, looked like this magnificent creature, and whether
he, in his turn, would ever come to resemble her granduncle.
