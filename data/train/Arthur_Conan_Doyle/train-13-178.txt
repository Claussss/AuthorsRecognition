      “‘What may you be wantin’?’ she asked, in a Northern accent.       “‘I am your neighbour over yonder,’ said I, nodding towards my
      house. ‘I see that you have only just moved in, so I thought that
      if I could be of any help to you in any—’       “‘Ay, we’ll just ask ye when we want ye,’ said she, and shut the
      door in my face. Annoyed at the churlish rebuff, I turned my back
      and walked home. All evening, though I tried to think of other
      things, my mind would still turn to the apparition at the window
      and the rudeness of the woman. I determined to say nothing about
      the former to my wife, for she is a nervous, highly strung woman,
      and I had no wish that she would share the unpleasant impression
      which had been produced upon myself. I remarked to her, however,
      before I fell asleep, that the cottage was now occupied, to which
      she returned no reply.
