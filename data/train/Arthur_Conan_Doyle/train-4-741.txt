I had just come to this resolution when my name was read out, on which I
rose and advanced into the inner chamber. It was a small but lofty room,
hung in blue silk with a broad gold cornice. In the centre was a square
table littered over with piles of papers, and behind this sat his Grace
with full-bottomed wig rolling down to his shoulders, very stately and
imposing. He had the same subtle air of the court which I had observed
both in Monmouth and in Sir Gervas, which, with his high bold features
and large piercing eyes, marked him as a leader of men. His private
scrivener sat beside him, taking notes of his directions, while the
others stood behind in a half circle, or took snuff together in the deep
recess of the window.
