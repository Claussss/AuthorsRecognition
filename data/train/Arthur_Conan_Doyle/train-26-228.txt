  "Insanity is often the logic of an accurate mind overtasked.
  Good mental machinery ought to break its own wheels and
  levers, if anything is thrust upon them suddenly which tends
  to stop them or reverse their motion. A weak mind does not
  accumulate force enough to hurt itself; stupidity often saves
  a man from going mad. We frequently see persons in insane
  hospitals, sent there in consequence of what are called
  religious mental disturbances. I confess that I think better
  of them than of many who hold the same notions, and keep
  their wits and enjoy life very well, outside of the asylums.
  Any decent person ought to go mad if he really holds such
  and such opinions.... Anything that is brutal, cruel,
  heathenish, that makes life hopeless for the most of mankind,
  and perhaps for entire races--anything that assumes the
  necessity for the extermination of instincts which were
  given to be regulated--no matter by what name you call
  it--no matter whether a fakir, or a monk, or a deacon
  believes it--if received, ought to produce insanity in
  every well-regulated mind."
