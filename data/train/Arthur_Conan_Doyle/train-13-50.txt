      “Where is he, then?”       “I have already said that he must have gone to King’s Pyland or
      to Mapleton. He is not at King’s Pyland. Therefore he is at
      Mapleton. Let us take that as a working hypothesis and see what
      it leads us to. This part of the moor, as the Inspector remarked,
      is very hard and dry. But it falls away towards Mapleton, and you
      can see from here that there is a long hollow over yonder, which
      must have been very wet on Monday night. If our supposition is
      correct, then the horse must have crossed that, and there is the
      point where we should look for his tracks.”
