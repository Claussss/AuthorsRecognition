      Holmes was curiously distrait, and we walked up and down the
      garden path for some time in silence.       “Have you a clue?” I asked, at last.       “It depends upon those cigarettes that I smoked,” said he. “It is
      possible that I am utterly mistaken. The cigarettes will show
      me.”       “My dear Holmes,” I exclaimed, “how on earth——”       “Well, well, you may see for yourself. If not, there’s no harm
      done. Of course, we always have the optician clue to fall back
      upon, but I take a short cut when I can get it. Ah, here is the
      good Mrs. Marker! Let us enjoy five minutes of instructive
      conversation with her.”
