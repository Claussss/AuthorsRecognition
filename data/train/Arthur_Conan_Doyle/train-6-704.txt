Sir Thomas Percy and Sir James Astley had ridden to the head of the
column, and Knolles conferred with them as they marched concerning the
plan of their campaign. Percy and Astley were young and hot-headed with
wild visions of dashing deeds and knight errantry, but Knolles with
cold, clear brain and purpose of iron held ever his object in view. “By the holy Dunstan and all the saints of Lindisfarne!” cried the
fiery Borderer, “it goes to my heart to ride forward when there are such
honorable chances on either side of us. Have I not heard that the French
are at Evran beyond the river, and is it not sooth that yonder castle,
the towers of which I see above the woods, is in the hands of a traitor,
who is false to his liege lord of Montford? There is little profit to be
gained upon this road, for the folk seem to have no heart for war.
Had we ventured as far over the marches of Scotland as we now are in
Brittany, we should not have lacked some honorable venture or chance of
winning worship.”
