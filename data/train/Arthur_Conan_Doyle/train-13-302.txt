      “‘Ah!’ cried Trevor. ‘You know where Mr. Beddoes is?’       “‘Bless you, sir, I know where all my old friends are,’ said the
      fellow with a sinister smile, and he slouched off after the maid
      to the kitchen. Mr. Trevor mumbled something to us about having
      been shipmate with the man when he was going back to the
      diggings, and then, leaving us on the lawn, he went indoors. An
      hour later, when we entered the house, we found him stretched
      dead drunk upon the dining-room sofa. The whole incident left a
      most ugly impression upon my mind, and I was not sorry next day
      to leave Donnithorpe behind me, for I felt that my presence must
      be a source of embarrassment to my friend.
