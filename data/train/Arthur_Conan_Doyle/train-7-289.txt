prisoners. Were there any of the friendly ones among them? If Tippy
Tilly and six of his men were there, and if Belmont could get his arms

Colonel craned his neck and groaned in his disappointment. He could see
the faces of the guards in the firelight. They were all Baggara Arabs,
men who were beyond either pity or bribery. Tippy Tilly and the others
must have gone on with the advance. For the first time the stiff old
soldier abandoned hope.
