I found on examination that he had had the loose rails securely fastened
so as to block up our former trysting-place, and though I prowled round
the whole long line of fencing, I was unable to find any other place
where an entrance could be effected. Here and there between the few chinks left in the barrier I could catch
glimpses of the Hall, and once I saw a rough-looking, middle-aged man
standing at a window on the lower floor, whom I supposed to be Israel
Stakes, the coachman. There was no sign, however, of Gabriel or of
Mordaunt, and their absence alarmed me. I was convinced that, unless
they were under some restraint, they would have managed to communicate
with my sister or myself. My fears became more and more acute as day
followed day without our seeing or hearing anything of them.
