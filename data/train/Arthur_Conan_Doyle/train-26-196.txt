However, all this is an absolute digression, for the books had no
business in this shelf at all. This corner is meant for chronicles
of various sorts. Here are three in a line, which carry you over a
splendid stretch of French (which usually means European) history,
each, as luck would have it, beginning just about the time when the
other leaves off. The first is Froissart, the second de Monstrelet,
and the third de Comines. When you have read the three you have the
best contemporary account first hand of considerably more than a
century--a fair slice out of the total written record of the human
race.
