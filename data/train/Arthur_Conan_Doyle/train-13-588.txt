      “Is he your junior?”       “Seven years my senior.”       “How comes it that he is unknown?”       “Oh, he is very well known in his own circle.”       “Where, then?”       “Well, in the Diogenes Club, for example.”       I had never heard of the institution, and my face must have
      proclaimed as much, for Sherlock Holmes pulled out his watch.       “The Diogenes Club is the queerest club in London, and Mycroft
      one of the queerest men. He’s always there from quarter to five
      to twenty to eight. It’s six now, so if you care for a stroll
      this beautiful evening I shall be very happy to introduce you to
      two curiosities.”
