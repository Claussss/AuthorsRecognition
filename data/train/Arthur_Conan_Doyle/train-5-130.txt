"Here's sevenpence," she said at last, holding out a little pile of
copper coins.  "I'll give you that and a wicker footstool." "But my fee is half-a-crown."  The doctor's views of the glory of his
profession cried out against this wretched haggling, and yet what was
he to do?  "Where am I to get 'arf-a-crown?  It is well for gentlefolk
like you who sit in your grand houses, and can eat and drink what you
like, an' charge 'arf-a-crown for just saying as much as, ''Ow d'ye
do?'  We can't pick up' arf-crowns like that.  What we gets we earns
'ard.  This sevenpence is just all I've got.  You told me to feed the
child light.  She must feed light, for what she's to have is more than
I know."
