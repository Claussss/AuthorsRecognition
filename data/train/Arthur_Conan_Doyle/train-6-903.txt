“Drink your own blood, Beaumanoir!” cried Dubois, and the weary men all
croaked together in dreadful laughter. But now the English had learned from experience, and under the guidance
of Croquart they fought no longer in a straight line, but in one so
bent that at last it became a circle. As the Bretons still pushed and
staggered against it they thrust it back on every side, until they had
turned it into the most dangerous formation of all, a solid block of
men, their faces turned outward, their weapons bristling forth to meet
every attack. Thus the English stood, and no assault could move them.
They could lean against each other back to back while they waited and
allowed their foemen to tire themselves out. Again and again the gallant
Bretons tried to make a way through. Again and again they were beaten
back by a shower of blows.
