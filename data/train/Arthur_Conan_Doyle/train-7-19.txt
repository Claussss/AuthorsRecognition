From somewhere amongst the hill shadows upon the other side of the river
there had risen a high shrill whimpering, rising and swelling, to end in
a long weary wail. “It's only a jackal, Miss Adams,” said Stephens. “I heard one when we
went out to see the Sphinx by moonlight.” But the American lady had risen, and her face showed that her nerves had
been ruffled. “If I had my time over again I wouldn't have come past Assouan,” said
she. “I can't think what possessed me to bring you all the way up here,
Sadie. Your mother will think that I am clean crazy, and I'd never dare
to look her in the eye if anything went wrong with us. I've seen all
I want to see of this river, and all I ask now is to be back at Cairo
again.”
