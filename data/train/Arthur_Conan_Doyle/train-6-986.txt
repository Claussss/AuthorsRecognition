It was high time; for already the first division of the French was close
upon them. If the charge of the horsemen had been terrible from its rush
and its fire, this steady advance of a huge phalanx of armored footmen
was even more fearsome to the spectator. They moved very slowly, on
account of the weight of their armor, but their progress was the more
regular and inexorable. With elbows touching--their shields slung in
front, their short five-foot spears carried in their right hands,
and their maces or swords ready at their belts, the deep column of
men-at-arms moved onward. Again the storm of arrows beat upon them
clinking and thudding on the armor. They crouched double behind their
shields as they met it. Many fell, but still the slow tide lapped
onward. Yelling, they surged up to the hedge, and lined it for half a
mile, struggling hard to pierce it.
