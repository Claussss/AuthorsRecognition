Their repulse had been hailed by wild yells of delight from the
Frenchmen, who danced with joy and waved their weapons madly over their
heads. But before their rejoicings had finished they saw the little boat
creeping out once more from the shadow of the Marie Rose, a great wooden
screen in her bows to protect her from the arrows. Without a pause she
came straight and fast for her enemy. The wounded archer had been put on
board, and Aylward would have had his place had Nigel been able to see
him upon the deck. The third archer, Hal Masters, had sprung in, and
one of the seamen, Wat Finnis of Hythe. With their hearts hardened to
conquer or to die, the five ran alongside the Frenchman and sprang upon
her deck. At the same instant a great iron weight crashed through the
bottom of their skiff, and their feet had hardly left her before she was
gone. There was no hope and no escape save victory.
