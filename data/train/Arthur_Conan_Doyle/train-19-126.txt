May 5.  I met Agatha and her mother at the station at eleven o'clock.
She is looking so bright, so happy, so beautiful.  And she was so
overjoyed to see me.  What have I done to deserve such love?  I went
back home with them, and we lunched together.  All the troubles seem in
a moment to have been shredded back from my life.  She tells me that I
am looking pale and worried and ill.  The dear child puts it down to my
loneliness and the perfunctory attentions of a housekeeper.  I pray
that she may never know the truth!  May the shadow, if shadow there
must be, lie ever black across my life and leave hers in the sunshine.
I have just come back from them, feeling a new man.  With her by my
side I think that I could show a bold face to any thing which life
might send.
