“Seven yards windage, Hal,” said one, whose hair was streaked with gray. “Five,” replied the other, letting loose his string. Alleyne gave a gulp
in his throat, for the yellow streak seemed to pass through the man; but
he still ran forward. “Seven, you jack-fool,” growled the first speaker, and his bow twanged
like a harp-string. The black man sprang high up into the air, and
shot out both his arms and his legs, coming down all a-sprawl among
the heather. “Right under the blade bone!” quoth the archer, sauntering
forward for his arrow.
