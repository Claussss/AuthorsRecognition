graybeard who sat near the chairman, “that Brother McMurdo should wait
until it is the good pleasure of the lodge to employ him.” “Sure, that was what I meant; I'm in your hands,” said McMurdo. “Your time will come, Brother,” said the chairman. “We have marked you
down as a willing man, and we believe that you will do good work in
these parts. There is a small matter to-night in which you may take a
hand if it so please you.”
