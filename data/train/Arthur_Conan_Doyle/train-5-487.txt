"Then the motion is carried, and your protest will be duly entered in
the minutes," said the chairman, and so the sitting was dissolved. The attendance at the electrocution was a very small one.  We four
members of the committee were, of course, present with the executioner,
who was to act under their orders.  The others were the United States
Marshal, the governor of the gaol, the chaplain, and three members of
the press.  The room was a small brick chamber, forming an outhouse to
the Central Electrical station.  It had been used as a laundry, and had
an oven and copper at one side, but no other furniture save a single
chair for the condemned man.  A metal plate for his feet was placed in
front of it, to which ran a thick, insulated wire.  Above, another wire
depended from the ceiling, which could be connected with a small
metallic rod projecting from a cap which was to be placed upon his
head.  When this connection was established Duncan Warner's hour was
come.
