It took all that time to work off the hot ferment which the
Revolution had left in men's veins. And they were not exhausted, for
the very last fight which the French fought was the finest of all.
Proud as we are of our infantry at Waterloo, it was really with the
French cavalry that the greenest laurels of that great epic rested.
They got the better of our own cavalry, they took our guns again
and again, they swept a large portion of our allies from the field,
and finally they rode off unbroken, and as full of fight as ever.
Read Gronow's "Memoirs," that chatty little yellow volume yonder
which brings all that age back to us more vividly than any more
pretentious work, and you will find the chivalrous admiration which
our officers expressed at the fine performance of the French
horsemen.
