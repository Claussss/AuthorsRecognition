I could not but admire him, for it was the very smile which I should
have myself smiled had I been in his position. “At least,” said I, “tell us the name of this village.” “It is Dobrova.” “And that is Minsk over yonder, I suppose.” “Yes, that is Minsk.” “Then we shall go to the village and we shall very soon find some one
who will translate this despatch.” So we rode onward together, a trooper with his carbine unslung on either
side of our prisoner. The village was but a little place, and I set a
guard at the ends of the single street, so that no one could escape from
it. It was necessary to call a halt and to find some food for the men
and horses, since they had travelled all night and had a long journey
still before them.
