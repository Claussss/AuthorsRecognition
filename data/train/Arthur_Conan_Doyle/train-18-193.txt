“No, I don't mean that exactly,” he answered. “I am too familiar with
cold steel and lead to be afraid of either. Do you know anything about
odyllic force, doctor?” “No, I do not,” I replied, glancing sharply at him to see if there were
any signs of his delirium returning. His expression was intelligent,
however, and the feverish flush had faded from his cheeks. “Ah, you Western scientific men are very much behind the day in some
things,” he remarked. “In all that is material and conducive to the
comfort of the body you are pre-eminent, but in what concerns the subtle
forces of Nature and the latent powers of the human spirit your best
men are centuries behind the humblest coolies of India. Countless
generations of beef-eating, comfort loving ancestors have given our
animal instincts the command over our spiritual ones. The body, which
should have been a mere tool for the use of the soul, has now become a
degrading prison in which it is confined. The Oriental soul and body are
not so welded together as ours are, and there is far less wrench when
they part in death.”
