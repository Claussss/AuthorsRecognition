“Good-morrow, dear father!” cried Aylward. “How is it with you at
Crooksbury? And how are the new black cow and the ewes from Alton and
Mary the dairymaid and all your gear?” “It ill becomes you to ask, you ne'er-do-weel,” said the old man. “You
have angered the monks of Waverley, whose tenant I am, and they would
drive me out of my farm. Yet there are three more years to run, and
do what they may I will bide till then. But little did I think that I
should lose my homestead through you, Samkin, and big as you are I would
knock the dust out of that green jerkin with a good hazel switch if I
had you at Crooksbury.”
