I was so surprised that I stood in the roadway gazing after this hulking
figure until the thought suddenly struck me that some serious result
might come from a meeting between a man of such blunt speech and the
choleric, hot-headed general. I therefore followed him as he hopped
along like some great, clumsy bird, and overtook him at the avenue gate,
where he stood grasping the ironwork and peering through at the dark
carriage-drive beyond.
