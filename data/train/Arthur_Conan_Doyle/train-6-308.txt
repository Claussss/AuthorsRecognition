Throughout the long feast which the skill of the Lady Ermyntrude had
arranged, Edward chatted lightly with the Italian as well as with
the barons near him. Finally, when the last dish was removed and the
gravy-soaked rounds of coarse bread which served as plates had been cast
to the dogs, the wine-flagons were passed round; and old Weathercote
the minstrel entered timidly with his harp in the hope that he might be
allowed to play before the King's majesty. But Edward had other sport
afoot.
