I am inclined to think that I may have trouble to-night.  There are two
things which make me fear so.  One is that I met Mrs. Wilson in the
street, and that she tells me that Miss Penclosa is better, though
still weak.  I find myself wishing in my heart that the illness had
been her last.  The other is that Professor Wilson comes back in a day
or two, and his presence would act as a constraint upon her.  I should
not fear our interviews if a third person were present.  For both these
reasons I have a presentiment of trouble to-night, and I shall take the
same precautions as before.
