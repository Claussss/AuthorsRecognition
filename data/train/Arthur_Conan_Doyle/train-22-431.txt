Day was breaking now, and a line of workmen were slowly making their
way, singly and in groups, along the blackened path. McMurdo and Scanlan strolled on with the others, keeping in sight of the

of it there came the sudden scream of a steam whistle. It was the
ten-minute signal before the cages descended and the day's labour began.
