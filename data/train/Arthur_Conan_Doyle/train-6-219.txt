for any man who bears my name, to chaffer and to haggle. You know

so give me that which is right and just, and we will say no more.” The goldsmith smiled. The business was growing more simple and more
profitable. He had intended to offer fifty, but surely it would be
sinful waste to give more than twenty-five.
