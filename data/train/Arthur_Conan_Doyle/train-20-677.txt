      “You are mad!” he cried. “You are talking insanely. I helped her
      to escape? Where is she now?”       “She is there,” said Holmes, and he pointed to a high bookcase in
      the corner of the room.       I saw the old man throw up his arms, a terrible convulsion passed
      over his grim face, and he fell back in his chair. At the same
      instant the bookcase at which Holmes pointed swung round upon a
      hinge, and a woman rushed out into the room. “You are right!” she
      cried, in a strange foreign voice. “You are right! I am here.”
