I started off upon my errands, but before doing so I took a look at the
barometer upon the wall. The mercury had sunk to the phenomenal point
of twenty-eight inches. Clearly the old sailor had not been wrong in his
interpretation of Nature's signs. As I returned over the moors in the evening, the wind was blowing in
short, angry puffs, and the western horizon was heaped with sombre
clouds which stretched their long, ragged tentacles right up to the
zenith.
