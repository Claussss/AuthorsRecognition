“Now, where would you like to smoke your cigar?” said Raffles Haw, with
a twinkle in his demure eyes. “Shall we go to India, or to Egypt, or to
China, or to--” “To South America,” said Robert. There was a twinkle, a whirr, and a sense of motion. The young artist
gazed about him in absolute amazement. Look where he would all round
were tree-ferns and palms with long drooping creepers, and a blaze of
brilliant orchids. Smoking-room, house, England, all were gone, and he
sat on a settee in the heart of a virgin forest of the Amazon. It was no
mere optical delusion or trick. He could see the hot steam rising from
the tropical undergrowth, the heavy drops falling from the huge green
leaves, the very grain and fibre of the rough bark which clothed the
trunks. Even as he gazed a green mottled snake curled noiselessly over
a branch above his head, and a bright-coloured paroquet broke suddenly
from amid the foliage and flashed off among the tree-trunks. Robert
gazed around, speechless with surprise, and finally turned upon his host
a face in which curiosity was not un-mixed with a suspicion of fear.
