“It is Black Will of Lynchmere,” said the bowman. “Many a match have I
shot with him, and I know well that no other man on the Surrey marches
could have sped such a shaft. I trust that you are houseled and shriven,
Will, for I have known you so long that I would not have your damnation
upon my soul.” He raised his bow as he spoke, and the string twanged with a rich deep
musical note. Aylward leaned upon his bow-stave as he keenly watched the
long swift flight of his shaft, skimming smoothly down the wind.
