A hard brown old woodman who had been shooting vermin in the Abbey
groves stepped forward with a grin of pleasure. After a lifetime of
stoats and foxes, this was indeed a noble quarry which was to fall
before him. Fitting a bolt on the nut of his taut crossbow, he
had raised it to his shoulder and leveled it at the fierce, proud,
disheveled head which tossed in savage freedom at the other side of
the wall. His finger was crooked on the spring, when a blow from a whip
struck the bow upward and the bolt flew harmless over the Abbey orchard,
while the woodman shrank abashed from Nigel Loring's angry eyes.
