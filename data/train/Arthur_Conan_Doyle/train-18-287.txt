I walked round this barrier as far as our old trysting-place without
finding any flaw through which I could get a glimpse of the house, for
the fence had been repaired with each rail overlapping the last, so
as to secure absolute privacy for those inside, and to block those
peep-holes which I had formerly used. At the old spot, however, where I had had the memorable interview with
the general on the occasion when he surprised me with his daughter, I
found that the two loose rails had been refixed in such a manner that
there was a gap of two inches or more between them.
