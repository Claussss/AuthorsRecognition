Months afterwards I saw a short paragraph in the _Star of India_
announcing that three eminent Buddhists--Lal Hoomi, Mowdar Khan, and Ram
Singh--had just returned in the steamship _Deccan_ from a short trip
to Europe. The very next item was devoted to an account of the life and
services of Major-General Heatherstone, “who has lately disappeared from
his country house in Wigtownshire, and who, there is too much reason to
fear, has been drowned.”
