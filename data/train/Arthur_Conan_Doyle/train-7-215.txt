“You need only pretend.” “That's enough,” said the Colonel, abruptly. Mansoor shrugged his shoulders. “What is the use of asking me, if you become angry when I answer? If you
do not wish to do what I say, then try your own attempt. At least you
cannot say that I have not done all I could to save you.” “I'm not angry,” the Colonel answered, after a pause, in a more
conciliatory voice, “but this is climbing down rather farther than we
care to go. Now, what I thought is this. You might, if you chose, give
this priest, or Moolah, who is coming to us, a hint that we really are
softening a bit upon the point. I don't think, considering the hole that
we are in, that there can be very much objection to that. Then, when
he comes, we might play up and take an interest and ask for more
instruction, and in that way hold the matter over for a day or two.
Don't you think that would be the best game?”
