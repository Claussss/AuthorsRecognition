With a glow in his heart Nigel saw those badges of famous captains and
leaders and knew that now at last he also might show his coat-armor in
such noble company. There was the flag of Jean Grailly, the Captal de
Buch, five silver shells on a black cross, which marked the presence of
the most famous soldier of Gascony, while beside it waved the red lion
of the noble Knight of Hainault, Sir Eustace d'Ambreticourt. These two
coats Nigel knew, as did every warrior in Europe, but a dense grove of
pennoned lances surrounded them, bearing charges which were strange
to him, from which he understood that these belonged to the Guienne
division of the army. Farther down the line the famous English ensigns
floated on the wind, the scarlet and gold of Warwick, the silver star
of Oxford, the golden cross of Suffolk, the blue and gold of Willoughby,
and the gold-fretted scarlet of Audley. In the very center of them all
was one which caused all others to pass from his mind, for close to the
royal banner of England, crossed with the label of the Prince, there
waved the war-worn flag with the red wedge upon the golden field which
marked the quarters of the noble Chandos.
