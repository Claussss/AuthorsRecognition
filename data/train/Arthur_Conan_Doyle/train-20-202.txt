      she. Who would have hurt little Elsie? I may have threatened
      her—God forgive me!—but I would not have touched a hair of her
      pretty head. Take it back—you! Say that she is not hurt!”       “She was found badly wounded, by the side of her dead husband.”       He sank with a deep groan on the settee and buried his face in
      his manacled hands. For five minutes he was silent. Then he
      raised his face once more, and spoke with the cold composure of
      despair.
