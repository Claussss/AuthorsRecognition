"Say you so? Well, it is a matter to be argued at some better time. But
I would fain have your name and style and what is it you purpose to do,

good Laertes as my father and young Telemachus as my son. For my work,
it is the taking of Troy." "And my work," said the barbarian, "is the building of Jebus, which now
we call Jerusalem. Our ways lie separate, but it may come back to your
memory that you have crossed the path of David, second King of the
Hebrews, together with his young son Solomon, who may follow him upon
the throne of Israel."
