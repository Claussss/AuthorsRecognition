      We stood at the window and watched the cab drive away. As I
      turned back, my eye caught the pellet of paper which the prisoner
      had tossed upon the table. It was the note with which Holmes had
      decoyed him.       “See if you can read it, Watson,” said he, with a smile.       It contained no word, but this little line of dancing men:       COME-HERE-AT-ONCE       “If you use the code which I have explained,” said Holmes, “you
      will find that it simply means ‘Come here at once.’ I was
      convinced that it was an invitation which he would not refuse,
      since he could never imagine that it could come from anyone but
      the lady. And so, my dear Watson, we have ended by turning the
      dancing men to good when they have so often been the agents of
      evil, and I think that I have fulfilled my promise of giving you
      something unusual for your notebook. Three-forty is our train,
      and I fancy we should be back in Baker Street for dinner.”
