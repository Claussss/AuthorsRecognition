It was the day of the sculling match between Hastie and Mullins, and a
stream of men were making their way down to the banks of the Isis.  A
May sun was shining brightly, and the yellow path was barred with the
black shadows of the tall elm-trees.  On either side the grey colleges
lay back from the road, the hoary old mothers of minds looking out from
their high, mullioned windows at the tide of young life which swept so
merrily past them.  Black-clad tutors, prim officials, pale reading
men, brown-faced, straw-hatted young athletes in white sweaters or
many-coloured blazers, all were hurrying towards the blue winding river
which curves through the Oxford meadows.
