Nigel perched himself upon the side of the high bed, swinging his legs
over the edge and gazing with wonder and amusement at the quaint face,
the ruffled yellow hair, and the sinewy shoulders of the famous warrior,
dimly seen amid a pillar of steam. He was in a mood for talk; so Nigel
with eager lips plied him with a thousand questions about the wars,
hanging upon every word which came back to him, like those of the
ancient oracles, out of the mist and the cloud. To Chandos himself, the
old soldier for whom war had lost its freshness, it was a renewal of his
own ardent youth to listen to Nigel's rapid questions and to mark the
rapt attention with which he listened.
