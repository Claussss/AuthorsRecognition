“How can you call them follies? Are they not the means by which
honorable advancement may be gained and one's lady exalted?” “It is right that you should think so, Nigel. At your age a man should
have a hot head and a high heart. I also had both and fought for my
lady's glove or for my vow or for the love of fighting. But as one grows
older and commands men one has other things to think of. One thinks less
of one's own honor and more of the safety of the army. It is not your
own spear, your own sword, your own arm, which will turn the tide of
fight; but a cool head may save a stricken field. He who knows when his
horsemen should charge and when they should fight on foot, he who can
mix his archers with his men-at-arms in such a fashion that each can
support the other, he who can hold up his reserve and pour it into the
battle when it may turn the tide, he who has a quick eye for boggy land
and broken ground--that is the man who is of more worth to an army than
Roland, Oliver and all the paladins.”
