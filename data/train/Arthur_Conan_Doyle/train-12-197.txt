“I at once grasped the fact that chance had placed in my hands a
chemical discovery of the very first importance. If bismuth were, under
certain conditions, to be subjected to the action of electricity, it
would begin by losing weight, and would finally be transformed into
mercury. I had broken down the partition which separated two elements. “But the process would be a constant one. It would presumably prove
to be a general law, and not an isolated fact. If bismuth turned into
mercury, what would mercury turn into? There would be no rest for me
until I had solved the question. I renewed the exhausted batteries and
passed the current through the bowl of quicksilver. For sixteen hours I
sat watching the metal, marking how it slowly seemed to curdle, to grow
firmer, to lose its silvery glitter and to take a dull yellow hue. When
I at last picked it up in a forceps, and threw it upon the table, it had
lost every characteristic of mercury, and had obviously become another
metal. A few simple tests were enough to show me that this other metal
was platinum.
