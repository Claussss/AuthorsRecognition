"But," says the critic, "what then of the clairvoyant descriptions, or
the visions where the aged father is seen, clad in the old-fashioned
garments of another age, or the grandmother with crinoline and chignon?
Are these the habiliments of heaven?"  Such visions are not spirits,
but they are pictures which are built up before us or shot by spirits
into our brains or those of the seer for the purposes of recognition.
Hence the grey hair and hence the ancient garb.  When a real spirit is
indeed seen it comes in another form to this, where the flowing robe,
such as has always been traditionally ascribed to the angels, is a
vital thing which, by its very colour and texture, proclaims the
spiritual condition of the wearer, and is probably a condensation of
that aura which surrounds us upon earth.
