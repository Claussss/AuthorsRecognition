Inns were not yet in vogue, but the poorer traveller found his quarters
with hospitable citizens, while men of distinction were frequently
housed in the annex of the temples, where the servants of the priests
attended to their wants. On that particular evening there stood in the
portico of the temple of Melmoth two remarkable figures who were the
centre of observation for a considerable fringe of Ph≈ìnician idlers. One
of these men was clearly by his face and demeanour a great chieftain.
His strongly-marked features were those of a man who had led an
adventurous life, and were suggestive of every virile quality from brave
resolve to desperate execution. His broad, high brow and contemplative
eyes showed that he was a man of wisdom as well as of valour. He was
clad, as became a Greek nobleman of the period, with a pure white linen
tunic, a gold-studded belt supporting a short sword, and a purple cloak.
The lower legs were bare, and the feet covered by sandals of red
leather, while a cap of white cloth was pushed back upon his brown
curls, for the heat of the day was past and the evening breeze most
welcome.
