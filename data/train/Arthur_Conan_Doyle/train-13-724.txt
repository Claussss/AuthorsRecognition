      “There was a pause then for about ten minutes, as if the person
      were waiting to see whether the noise had awakened me. Then I
      heard a gentle creaking as the window was very slowly opened. I
      could stand it no longer, for my nerves are not what they used to
      be. I sprang out of bed and flung open the shutters. A man was
      crouching at the window. I could see little of him, for he was
      gone like a flash. He was wrapped in some sort of cloak which
      came across the lower part of his face. One thing only I am sure
      of, and that is that he had some weapon in his hand. It looked to
      me like a long knife. I distinctly saw the gleam of it as he
      turned to run.”
