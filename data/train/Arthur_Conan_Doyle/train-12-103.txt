all conscience.” “I shall so look forward to seeing it,” cried Laura, clasping her hands.
“It has been one of the dreams of my life to see India. I have read so
much of it, the temples, the forests, the great rivers, and the tigers.
Why, you would hardly believe it, but I have never seen a tiger except
in a picture.”
