"Really, Austin, I do not know what is the matter with you this
morning.  One would almost think that you doubted my word.  If my boots
are dusty, it must be, of course, that I have put on a pair which the
maid had not cleaned." It was perfectly evident that she knew nothing whatever about the
matter, and I reflected that, after all, perhaps it was better that I
should not enlighten her.  It might frighten her, and could serve no
good purpose that I could see.  I said no more about it, therefore, and
left shortly afterward to give my lecture.
