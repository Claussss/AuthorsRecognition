      A few minutes later we were joined by a short, stout man whose
      olive face and coal-black hair proclaimed his Southern origin,
      though his speech was that of an educated Englishman. He shook
      hands eagerly with Sherlock Holmes, and his dark eyes sparkled
      with pleasure when he understood that the specialist was anxious
      to hear his story.       “I do not believe that the police credit me—on my word, I do
      not,” said he in a wailing voice. “Just because they have never
      heard of it before, they think that such a thing cannot be. But I
      know that I shall never be easy in my mind until I know what has
      become of my poor man with the sticking-plaster upon his face.”
