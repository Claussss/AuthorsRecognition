It moved in the shadow of the hedge, silently and furtively, a dark,
crouching figure, dimly visible against the black background.  Even as
he gazed back at it, it had lessened its distance by twenty paces, and
was fast closing upon him.  Out of the darkness he had a glimpse of a
scraggy neck, and of two eyes that will ever haunt him in his dreams.
He turned, and with a cry of terror he ran for his life up the avenue.
There were the red lights, the signals of safety, almost within a
stone's throw of him.  He was a famous runner, but never had he run as
he ran that night.
