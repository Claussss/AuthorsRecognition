Apart from his writings, there must have been something very noble
about Fielding as a man. He was a better hero than any that he drew.
Alone he accepted the task of cleansing London, at that time the
most dangerous and lawless of European capitals. Hogarth's pictures
give some notion of it in the pre-Fielding days, the low roughs,
the high-born bullies, the drunkenness, the villainies, the thieves'
kitchens with their riverside trapdoors, down which the body is
thrust. This was the Augean stable which had to be cleaned, and
poor Hercules was weak and frail and physically more fitted for a
sick-room than for such a task. It cost him his life, for he died at
47, worn out with his own exertions. It might well have cost him his
life in more dramatic fashion, for he had become a marked man to
the criminal classes, and he headed his own search-parties when, on
the information of some bribed rascal, a new den of villainy was
exposed. But he carried his point. In little more than a year the
thing was done, and London turned from the most rowdy to what it has
ever since remained, the most law-abiding of European capitals. Has
any man ever left a finer monument behind him?
