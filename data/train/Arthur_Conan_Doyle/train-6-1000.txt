mound yonder, and so fall upon them unseen. Let all that are left of the
archers gather on each side, shoot away their arrows, and then fight
as best they may. Wait till they are past yonder thorn-bush and then,
Walter, bear my banner straight against that of the King of France. Fair
sirs, may God and the thought of your ladies hold high your hearts!”
