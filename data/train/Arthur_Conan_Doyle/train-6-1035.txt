There let us leave them, their hearts full of gentle joy, the golden
future of hope and promise stretching out before their youthful eyes.
Alas for those green spring dreaming! How often do they fade and wither
until they fall and rot, a dreary sight, by the wayside of life! But
here, by God's blessing, it was not so, for they burgeoned and they
grew, ever fairer and more noble, until the whole wide world might
marvel at the beauty of it.
