      “I am afraid there are no signs here,” said he. “One could hardly
      hope for any upon so dry a day. Your servant seems to have quite
      recovered. You left him in a chair, you say. Which chair?”       “By the window there.”       “I see. Near this little table. You can come in now. I have
      finished with the carpet. Let us take the little table first. Of
      course, what has happened is very clear. The man entered and took
      the papers, sheet by sheet, from the central table. He carried
      them over to the window table, because from there he could see if
      you came across the courtyard, and so could effect an escape.”
