April 10.  No, thank God, all went well last night.  I really could not
face the gardener again.  I locked my door and thrust the key
underneath it, so that I had to ask the maid to let me out in the
morning.  But the precaution was really not needed, for I never had any
inclination to go out at all.  Three evenings in succession at home!  I
am surely near the end of my troubles, for Wilson will be home again
either today or tomorrow.  Shall I tell him of what I have gone through
or not?  I am convinced that I should not have the slightest sympathy
from him.  He would look upon me as an interesting case, and read a
paper about me at the next meeting of the Psychical Society, in which
he would gravely discuss the possibility of my being a deliberate liar,
and weigh it against the chances of my being in an early stage of
lunacy.  No, I shall get no comfort out of Wilson.
