“How is Mr. Holmes, sir?” he asked. It was an old acquaintance, Inspector Morton, of Scotland Yard, dressed
in unofficial tweeds. “He is very ill,” I answered. He looked at me in a most singular fashion. Had it not been too
fiendish, I could have imagined that the gleam of the fanlight showed
exultation in his face. “I heard some rumour of it,” said he. The cab had driven up, and I left him. Lower Burke Street proved to be a line of fine houses lying in the
vague borderland between Notting Hill and Kensington. The particular
one at which my cabman pulled up had an air of smug and demure
respectability in its old-fashioned iron railings, its massive
folding-door, and its shining brasswork. All was in keeping with a
solemn butler who appeared framed in the pink radiance of a tinted
electrical light behind him.
