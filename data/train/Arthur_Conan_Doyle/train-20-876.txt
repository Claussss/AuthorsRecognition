      replaced, and the drugget had only just been drawn straight when

      leaning languidly against the mantelpiece, resigned and patient,
      endeavouring to conceal his irrepressible yawns.       “Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Holmes, I can see that you are
      bored to death with the whole affair. Well, he has confessed, all
      right. Come in here, MacPherson. Let these gentlemen hear of your
      most inexcusable conduct.”
