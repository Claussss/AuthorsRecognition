Mary was dark as night, grave-featured, plain-visaged, with steady brown
eyes looking bravely at the world from under a strong black arch of
brows. None could call her beautiful, and when her fair sister cast her
arm round her and placed her cheek against hers, as was her habit when
company was there, the fairness of the one and the plainness of the
other leaped visibly to the eyes of all, each the clearer for that hard
contrast. And yet, here and there, there was one who, looking at her
strange, strong face, and at the passing gleams far down in her dark
eyes, felt that this silent woman with her proud bearing and her queenly
grace had in her something of strength, of reserve and of mystery which
was more to them than all the dainty glitter of her sister.
