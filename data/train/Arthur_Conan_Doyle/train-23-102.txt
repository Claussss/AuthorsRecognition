Here we have, I think, some attempt at a generalisation, which might,
perhaps, be useful in evolving some first signs of order out of this
chaos.  It is conceivable that the thinner emanation of the clairvoyant
would extend far further than the thick material ectoplasm, but have
the same property of moulding itself into life, though the life forms
would only be visible to the clairvoyant eye.  Thus, when Mr. Tom
Tyrrell, or any other competent exponent, stands upon the platform his
emanation fills the hall.  Into this emanation, as into the visible
ectoplasm in Geley's experiments, break the faces and forms of those
from the other side who are attracted to the scene by their sympathy
with various members of the audience.  They are seen and described by
Mr. Tyrrell, who with his finely attuned senses, carefully conserved
(he hardly eats or drinks upon a day when he demonstrates), can hear
that thinner higher voice that calls their names, their old addresses
and their messages.  So, too, when Mr. Hope and Mrs. Buxton stand with
their hands joined over the cap of the camera, they are really throwing
out a misty ectoplasm from which the forms loom up which appear upon
the photographic plate.  It may be that I mistake an analogy for an
explanation, but I put the theory on record for what it is worth.
