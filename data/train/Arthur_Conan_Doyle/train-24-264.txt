CHAPTER X. HOW HORDLE JOHN FOUND A MAN WHOM HE MIGHT FOLLOW. 
If he might not return to Beaulieu within the year, and if his brother's
dogs were to be set upon him if he showed face upon Minstead land, then
indeed he was adrift upon earth. North, south, east, and west--he might
turn where he would, but all was equally chill and cheerless. The Abbot
had rolled ten silver crowns in a lettuce-leaf and hid them away in the
bottom of his scrip, but that would be a sorry support for twelve long
months. In all the darkness there was but the one bright spot of the
sturdy comrades whom he had left that morning; if he could find them
again all would be well. The afternoon was not very advanced, for all
that had befallen him. When a man is afoot at cock-crow much may be done
in the day. If he walked fast he might yet overtake his friends ere they
reached their destination. He pushed on therefore, now walking and now
running. As he journeyed he bit into a crust which remained from his
Beaulieu bread, and he washed it down by a draught from a woodland
stream.
