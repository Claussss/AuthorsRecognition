Long talk with Agatha and Mrs. Marden in the evening about our
marriage.  We think that the summer vac. (the beginning of it) would
be the best time for the wedding.  Why should we delay?  I grudge even
those few months.  Still, as Mrs. Marden says, there are a good many
things to be arranged. March 28.  Mesmerized again by Miss Penclosa.  Experience much the same
as before, save that insensibility came on more quickly.  See Note-book
A for temperature of room, barometric pressure, pulse, and respiration
as taken by Professor Wilson.
