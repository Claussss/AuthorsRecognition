      “My way ran down a dried-up watercourse, which we hoped would
      screen me from the enemy’s sentries; but as I crept round the
      corner of it I walked right into six of them, who were crouching
      down in the dark waiting for me. In an instant I was stunned with
      a blow and bound hand and foot. But the real blow was to my heart
      and not to my head, for as I came to and listened to as much as I
      could understand of their talk, I heard enough to tell me that my
      comrade, the very man who had arranged the way that I was to
      take, had betrayed me by means of a native servant into the hands
      of the enemy.
