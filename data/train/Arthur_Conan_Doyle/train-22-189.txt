should an athletic man develop his frame upon so unnatural an instrument
as a single dumb-bell?” It was late that night when Holmes returned from his solitary excursion.
We slept in a double-bedded room, which was the best that the little
country inn could do for us. I was already asleep when I was partly
awakened by his entrance.
