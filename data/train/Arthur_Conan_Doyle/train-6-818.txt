In front of them lay a stone-flagged corridor, across which lay the
dead body of the janitor. It had doors on either side of it, and another
grated door at the farther end. A strange hubbub, a kind of low droning
and whining filled the air. The four men were standing listening, full
of wonder as to what this might mean, when a sharp cry came from behind
them. The priest lay in a shapeless heap upon the ground, and the blood
was rushing from his gaping throat. Down the passage, a black shadow in
the yellow light, there fled a crouching man, who clattered with a stick
as he went.
