would have none of his wooing, nor in sooth would I. On that he swore
a vow against us, and as he is known to be a perilous man, with many

harm then, but that my horse Troubadour trod with a tender foot upon a
sharp stick, rearing and throwing me to the ground. See to my gown, the

tire-woman sets eyes upon it!”
