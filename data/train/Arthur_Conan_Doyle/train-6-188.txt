“Then you shall do it to-morrow morning, good father, for I will come
and see you then. But indeed I did not do more at Waverley than you
would have done yourself. Look me in the eye, old hothead, and tell
me if you would have stood by while the last Loring--look at him as he
rides with his head in the air and his soul in the clouds--was shot down
before your very eyes at the bidding of that fat monk! If you would,
then I disown you as my father.”
