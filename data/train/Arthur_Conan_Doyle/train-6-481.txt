Nigel stared at him, with a perplexed brow. “Fair sir, my heart grows
heavy as I hear you. Do you then say that our chivalry can make no head
against archers, billmen and the like?” “Nay, Nigel, for it has also been very clearly shown that the best
foot-soldiers unsupported cannot hold their own against the mailed
horsemen.” “To whom then is the victory?” asked Nigel. “To him who can mix his horse and foot, using each to strengthen the
other. Apart they are weak. Together they are strong. The archer who
can weaken the enemy's line, the horseman who can break it when it is
weakened, as was done at Falkirk and Duplin, there is the secret of our
strength. Now touching this same battle of Falkirk, I pray you for one
instant to give it your attention.”
