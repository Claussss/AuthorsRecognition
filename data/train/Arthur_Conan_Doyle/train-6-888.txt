But alas for Nigel and his hopes of some great deed! His was at least
the fate of the brave, for he was the first to fall. With a high heart
he had placed himself in the line as nearly opposite to Beaumanoir as he
could, and had made straight for the Breton leader, remembering that in
the out set the quarrel had been so ordered that it lay between them.
But ere he could reach his goal he was caught in the swirl of his own
comrades, and being the lighter man was swept aside and dashed into the
arms of Alain de Karanais, the left-handed swordsman, with such a crash
that the two rolled upon the ground together. Light footed as a cat,
Nigel had sprung up first, and was stooping over the Breton Squire when
the powerful dwarf Raguenel brought his mace thudding down upon the
exposed back of his helmet. With a groan Nigel fell upon his face, blood
gushing from his mouth, nose, and ears. There he lay, trampled over by
either party, while that great fight for which his fiery soul had panted
was swaying back and forward above his unconscious form.
