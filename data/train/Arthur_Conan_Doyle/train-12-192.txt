“Well, it was to such a chance that my own great discovery--perhaps the
greatest that the world has seen--was due, though I may claim the credit
of having originated the line of thought which led up to it. I had
frequently speculated as to the effect which powerful currents of
electricity exercise upon any substance through which they are poured
for a considerable time. I did not here mean such feeble currents as
are passed along a telegraph wire, but I mean the very highest possible
developments. Well, I tried a series of experiments upon this point. I
found that in liquids, and in compounds, the force had a disintegrating
effect. The well-known experiment of the electrolysis of water will, of
course, occur to you. But I found that in the case of elemental solids
the effect was a remarkable one. The element slowly decreased in weight,
without perceptibly altering in composition. I hope that I make myself
clear to you?”
