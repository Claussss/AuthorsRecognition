      “I have a few questions to ask Miss Cushing,” said he.       “In that case I may leave you here,” said Lestrade, “for I have
      another small business on hand. I think that I have nothing
      further to learn from Miss Cushing. You will find me at the
      police-station.”       “We shall look in on our way to the train,” answered Holmes. A
      moment later he and I were back in the front room, where the
      impassive lady was still quietly working away at her
      antimacassar. She put it down on her lap as we entered and looked
      at us with her frank, searching blue eyes.
