      “It was just as if they had been given into my hands. There was a
      bit of a haze, and you could not see more than a few hundred
      yards. I hired a boat for myself, and I pulled after them. I
      could see the blur of their craft, but they were going nearly as
      fast as I, and they must have been a long mile from the shore
      before I caught them up. The haze was like a curtain all round
      us, and there were we three in the middle of it. My God, shall I
      ever forget their faces when they saw who was in the boat that
      was closing in upon them? She screamed out. He swore like a
      madman and jabbed at me with an oar, for he must have seen death
      in my eyes. I got past it and got one in with my stick that
      crushed his head like an egg. I would have spared her, perhaps,
      for all my madness, but she threw her arms round him, crying out
      to him, and calling him ‘Alec.’ I struck again, and she lay
      stretched beside him. I was like a wild beast then that had
      tasted blood. If Sarah had been there, by the Lord, she should
      have joined them. I pulled out my knife, and—well, there! I’ve
      said enough. It gave me a kind of savage joy when I thought how
      Sarah would feel when she had such signs as these of what her
      meddling had brought about. Then I tied the bodies into the boat,
      stove a plank, and stood by until they had sunk. I knew very well
      that the owner would think that they had lost their bearings in
      the haze, and had drifted off out to sea. I cleaned myself up,
      got back to land, and joined my ship without a soul having a
      suspicion of what had passed. That night I made up the packet for
      Sarah Cushing, and next day I sent it from Belfast.
