      along the other side of the road. As we watched him he looked
      across at a boy who was bawling out the latest edition of the
      evening paper, and running over among the cabs and busses, he
      bought one from him. Then, clutching it in his hand, he vanished
      through a doorway.       “There he goes!” cried Hall Pycroft. “These are the company’s
      offices into which he has gone. Come with me, and I’ll fix it up
      as easily as possible.”
