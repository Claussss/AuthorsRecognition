      “You are confident that the thief came in a cab?”       “If not, there is no harm done. But if Mr. Phelps is correct in
      stating that there is no hiding-place either in the room or the
      corridors, then the person must have come from outside. If he
      came from outside on so wet a night, and yet left no trace of
      damp upon the linoleum, which was examined within a few minutes
      of his passing, then it is exceeding probable that he came in a
      cab. Yes, I think that we may safely deduce a cab.”
