‘I wonder, Colonel Saxon,’ said our host severely, ‘that you should
speak favourably of that licentious poem, which is composed, as I have
heard, for the sole purpose of casting ridicule upon the godly. I should
as soon have expected to hear you praise the wicked and foolish work of
Hobbes, with his mischievous thesis, “A Deo rex, a rege lex.”’ ‘It is true that I contemn and despise the use which Butler hath made of
his satire,’ said Saxon adroitly; ‘yet I may admire the satire itself,
just as one may admire a damascened blade without approving of the
quarrel in which it is drawn.’
