“This house should be Cosford,” said he. “Are you by chance the Lady
Mary who dwells there?” The lady bowed her proud dark head. “Then,” said he, “Squire Nigel Loring sends you greeting and tells you
that Saint Catharine has been his friend.” Then turning to his servant
he cried: “Heh, Raoul, our task is done! Your master is a free man once
more. Come, lad, come, the nearest port to France! Hola! Hola! Hola!”
 And so without a word more the two, master and man, set spurs to their
horses and galloped like madmen down the long slope of Hindhead, until
as she looked after them they were but two dark dots in the distance,
waist-high in the ling and the bracken.
