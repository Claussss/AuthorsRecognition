“I have not brought him with me, sir,” I answered, feeling rather
disgusted at being made responsible for the presence of the
disreputable-looking vagabond beside me. “I found him on the road here,
and he desired to be directed to you, so I showed him the way. I know
nothing of him myself.” “What do you want with me, then?” the general asked sternly, turning to
my companion. “If you please, sir,” said the ex-corporal, speaking in a whining voice,
and touching his moleskin cap with a humility which contrasted strangely
with the previous rough independence of his bearing, “I'm an old gunner
in the Queen's service, sir, and knowing your name by hearing it in
India I thought that maybe you would take me as your groom or gardener,
or give me any other place as happened to be vacant.”
