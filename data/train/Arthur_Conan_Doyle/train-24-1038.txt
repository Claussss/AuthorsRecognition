The Spanish prisoner looked with exultant eyes upon the deep and serried
ranks of his countrymen. “By Saint James!” said he, “if ye fall this day ye fall by no mean
hands, for the flower of the knighthood of Castile ride under the banner
of Don Tello, with the chivalry of Asturias, Toledo, Leon, Cordova,
Galicia, and Seville. I see the guidons of Albornez, Cacorla, Rodriguez,
Tavora, with the two great orders, and the knights of France and of
Aragon. If you will take my rede you will come to a composition with
them, for they will give you such terms as you have given me.”
