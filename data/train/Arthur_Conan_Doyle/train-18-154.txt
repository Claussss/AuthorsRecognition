There was the young gentleman, tae, and his sister--they baith seemed
to hae some trouble on their minds, and the general maist of a', for the
ithers were up ane day and down anither; but he was aye the same, wi' a
face as dour and sad as a felon when he feels the tow roond his neck. I speered o' the hussies in the kitchen whether they kenned what was
amiss wi' the family, but the cook she answered me back that it wasna
for her tae inquire into the affairs o' her superiors, and that it was
naething to her as long as she did her work and had her wages. They were
puir, feckless bodies, the twa o' them, and would scarce gie an answer
tae a ceevil question, though they could clack lood eneugh when they had
a mind.
