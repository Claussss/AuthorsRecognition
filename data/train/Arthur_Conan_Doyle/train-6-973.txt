heads. A waxed arrow will pass where a dry will be held. Tom Beverley,
you jack-fool! where is your bracer-guard? Your string will flay your
arm ere you reach your up-shot this day. And you, Watkin, draw not to
your mouth, as is your wont, but to your shoulder. You are so used to
the wine-pot that the string must needs follow it. Nay, stand loose, and
give space for your drawing arms, for they will be on us anon.”
