'I don't think I shall always stay here. The neighbourhood is too
crowded. I should like to have a house somewhere further out.' Mr. Jordan did not comment on this, but it kept a place in his daily
thoughts, and became at length so much of an anxiety that he invited
a renewal of the subject. 'You have no intention of moving just yet, Mrs. Elderfield?' 'I was going to tell you, sir,' replied the landlady, with her
respectful calm, 'that I have decided to make a change next spring. Some
friends of mine have gone to live at Wood Green, and I shall look for a
house in the same neighbourhood.'
