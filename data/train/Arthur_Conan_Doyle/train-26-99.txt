  "He stops as regularly as the swordsman, and carries his blows
  truly in the line; he steps not back distrusting of himself,
  to stop a blow, and puddle in the return, with an arm unaided
  by his body, producing but fly-flap blows. No! Broughton steps
  boldly and firmly in, bids a welcome to the coming blow;
  receives it with his guardian arm; then, with a general
  summons of his swelling muscles, and his firm body seconding
  his arm, and supplying it with all its weight, pours the
  pile-driving force upon his man."
