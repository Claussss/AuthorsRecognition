There is no need for me to enter into further details, nor to describe
the grief which our tidings conveyed to mother and to daughter. Their
long expectation of some calamity was not sufficient to prepare them for
the terrible reality. For weeks my poor Gabriel hovered between life and death, and though
she came round at last, thanks to the nursing of my sister and the
professional skill of Dr. John Easterling, she has never to this day
entirely recovered her former vigour. Mordaunt, too, suffered much
for some time, and it was only after our removal to Edinburgh that he
rallied from the shock which he had undergone.
