“Now, to a chemist, there was something very suggestive in the order in
which these changes had been effected. Perhaps you can see the relation,
Robert, which they bear to each other?” “No, I cannot say that I do.” Robert had sat listening to this strange statement with parted lips and
staring eyes. “I will show you. Speaking atomically, bismuth is the heaviest of the
metals. Its atomic weight is 210. The next in weight is lead, 207, and
then comes mercury at 200. Possibly the long period during which the
current had acted in my absence had reduced the bismuth to lead and
the lead in turn to mercury. Now platinum stands at 197.5, and it was
accordingly the next metal to be produced by the continued current. Do
you see now?”
