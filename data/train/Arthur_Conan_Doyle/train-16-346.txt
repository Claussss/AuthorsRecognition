The doctor half turned in his chair and patted the arch of the young
man's knee as he might the neck of a restless horse. "What, then?" he asked, looking over his shoulder at the pale face with
the startled eyes. Twice the young man parted his lips. Then he stooped with a sudden
gesture and turning up the right leg of his trousers he pulled down his
sock and thrust forward his shin. The doctor made a clicking noise with
his tongue as he glanced at it.
