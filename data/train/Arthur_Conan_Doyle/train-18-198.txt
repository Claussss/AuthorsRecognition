I then perceived that what I had taken for a bride-cake was really an

peaks were not unlike the familiar sugar pinnacles and minarets. “These are the Himalayas, or at least the Surinam branch of them,” he
remarked, “showing the principal passes between India and Afghanistan.
It is an excellent model. This ground has a special interest for me,
because it is the scene of my first campaign. There is the pass opposite
Kalabagh and the Thul valley, where I was engaged during the summer
of 1841 in protecting the convoys and keeping the Afridis in order. It
wasn't a sinecure, I promise you.”
