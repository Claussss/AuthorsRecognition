Romsey! for I told him that the pin was loose, and yet he must needs
gainsay me, like the foolish daffe that he is.” “I trust that you have taken no hurt, my fair lady,” said Alleyne,
conducting her to the bank, upon which John had already placed a
cushion. “Nay, I have had no scath, though I have lost my silver tweezers. Now,
lack-a-day! did God ever put breath into such a fool as Michael Easover
of Romsey? But I am much beholden to you, gentle sirs. Soldiers ye are,
as one may readily see. I am myself a soldier's daughter,” she added,
casting a somewhat languishing glance at John, “and my heart ever goes
out to a brave man.”
