accomplishments is like to prove of much use to us on our present
errand. You do, however, but jest, no doubt, when you talk of descending

we come,” as Will Shakespeare has it. If you would be able to say that
you have in your service Sir Gervas Jerome, knight banneret, and sole
owner of Beacham Ford Park, with a rent-roll of four thousand good
pounds a year, he is now up for sale, and will be knocked down to the
bidder who pleases him best. Say but the word, and we’ll have another
flagon of sack to clinch the bargain.’
