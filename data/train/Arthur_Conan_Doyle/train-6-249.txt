“Nay, sire, you open a great debate which extends far beyond this
question of the Holy Land, though that may indeed be chosen as a
fair example. It is the question of all sin, of all suffering, of
all injustice--why it should pass without the rain of fire and the
lightnings of Sinai. The wisdom of God is beyond our understanding.” The King shrugged his shoulders. “This is an easy answer, my Lord
Bishop. You are a prince of the Church. It would fare ill with an
earthly prince who could give no better answer to the affairs which
concerned his realm.”
