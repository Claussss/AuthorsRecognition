It was a little past seven before we reached the Westminster wharf, and
found our launch awaiting us.  Holmes eyed it critically. "Is there anything to mark it as a police-boat?" "Yes,--that green lamp at the side." "Then take it off." The small change was made, we stepped on board, and the ropes were cast
off.  Jones, Holmes, and I sat in the stern.  There was one man at the
rudder, one to tend the engines, and two burly police-inspectors
forward.
