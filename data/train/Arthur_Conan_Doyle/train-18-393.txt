The cliffs were not more than a couple of hundred yards apart at the
entrance, but as we advanced they grew nearer and nearer, until a half
company in close order could hardly march abreast. A sort of twilight reigned in this strange valley, and the dim,
uncertain light made the great, basalt rocks loom up vague and
fantastic. There was no path, and the ground was most uneven, but I
pushed on briskly, cautioning my fellows to have their fingers on their
triggers, for I could see that we were nearing the point where the two
cliffs would form an acute angle with each other.
