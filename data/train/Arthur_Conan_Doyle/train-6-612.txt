“Nay, say no more about that,” growled an old wizened bowman, with a
brown-parchment skin and little beady eyes. “It is better in these days
to mend a bow than to bend one. You who never looked a Frenchman in the
face are pricked off for ninepence a day, and I, who have fought five
stricken fields, can earn but fourpence.” “It is in my mind, John of Tuxford, that you have looked in the face
more pots of mead than Frenchmen,” said the old bowyer. “I am swinking
from dawn to night, while you are guzzling in an alestake. How now,
youngster? Overbowed? Put your bow in the tiller. It draws at sixty
pounds--not a pennyweight too much for a man of your inches. Lay more
body to it, lad, and it will come to you. If your bow be not stiff, how
can you hope for a twenty-score flight. Feathers? Aye, plenty and of the
best. Here, peacock at a groat each. Surely a dandy archer like you, Tom
Beverley, with gold earrings in your ears, would have no feathering but
peacocks?”
