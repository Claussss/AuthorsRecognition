I was still drinking in this wonderful panorama when the heavy hand of
the Professor fell upon my shoulder. "This way, my young friend," said he; "vestigia nulla retrorsum.  Never
look rearwards, but always to our glorious goal." The level of the plateau, when I turned, was exactly that on which we
stood, and the green bank of bushes, with occasional trees, was so near
that it was difficult to realize how inaccessible it remained.  At a
rough guess the gulf was forty feet across, but, so far as I could see,
it might as well have been forty miles.  I placed one arm round the
trunk of the tree and leaned over the abyss.  Far down were the small
dark figures of our servants, looking up at us.  The wall was
absolutely precipitous, as was that which faced me.
