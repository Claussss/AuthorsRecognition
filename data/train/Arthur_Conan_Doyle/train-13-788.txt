      I had often admired my friend’s courage, but never more than now,
      as he sat quietly checking off a series of incidents which must
      have combined to make up a day of horror.       “You will spend the night here?” I said.       “No, my friend, you might find me a dangerous guest. I have my
      plans laid, and all will be well. Matters have gone so far now
      that they can move without my help as far as the arrest goes,
      though my presence is necessary for a conviction. It is obvious,
      therefore, that I cannot do better than get away for the few days
      which remain before the police are at liberty to act. It would be
      a great pleasure to me, therefore, if you could come on to the
      Continent with me.”
