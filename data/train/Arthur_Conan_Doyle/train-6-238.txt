Behind the knights, who were forbidden to scatter and must always follow
the King's person, there was a body of twenty or thirty hobblers or
mounted bowmen, together with several squires, unarmed themselves but
leading spare horses upon which the heavier part of their knights'
equipment was carried. A straggling tail of falconers, harbingers,
varlets, body-servants and huntsmen holding hounds in leash completed
the long and many-colored train which rose and dipped on the low
undulations of the moor.
