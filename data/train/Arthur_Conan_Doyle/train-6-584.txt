Delves smiled good-humoredly. “Nay, be not so hot,” said he. “Had you
upheld any other knight, save perhaps Sir Walter Manny, I had taken you
at your word, and your master or mine would have had place for a new
Squire. But indeed it is only truth that no knight is second to Chandos,
nor would I draw my sword to lower his pride of place. Ha, Sir James'
cup is low! I must see to it!” He darted off, a flagon of Gascony in
his hand. “The King hath had good news to-night,” he continued when he
returned. “I have not seen him in so merry a mind since the night when
we took the Frenchmen and he laid his pearl chaplet upon the head of
de Ribeaumont. See how he laughs, and the Prince also. That laugh bodes
some one little good, or I am the more mistaken. Have a care! Sir John's
plate is empty.”
