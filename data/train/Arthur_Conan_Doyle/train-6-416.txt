But the affair wanted careful handling. The arrival of any,
reinforcements, or even the crossing of any famous soldier, would have
alarmed the French and warned them that their plot had been discovered.
Therefore it was in twos and threes in the creyers and provision ships
which were continually passing from shore to shore that the chosen
warriors and their squires were brought to Calais. There they were
passed at night through the water-gate into the castle where they could
lie hidden, unknown to the townsfolk, until the hour for action had
come.
