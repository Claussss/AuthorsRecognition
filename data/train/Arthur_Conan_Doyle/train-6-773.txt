Quick as a flash old Wat's arrow had sped, and the Butcher sprang back
with a howl of pain, his hand skewered by a cloth-yard shaft. As he
shook it furiously at his enemies a second grazed his knuckles. With
a brutal kick of his metal-shod feet he hurled young Alspaye over the
edge, looked down for a few moments at his death agonies, and then
walked slowly from the parapet, nursing his dripping hand, the arrows
still ringing loudly upon his back-piece as he went.
