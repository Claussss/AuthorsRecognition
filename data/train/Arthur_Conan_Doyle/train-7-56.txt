“It is Monsieur Fardet's opinion against that of the officers who have
the responsibility of caring for the safety of the frontier,” said the
Colonel, coldly. “At least we will all agree that they have the effect
of making the scene very much more picturesque.” The desert upon their right lay in long curves of sand, like the dunes
which might have fringed some forgotten primeval sea. Topping them they
could see the black, craggy summits of the curious volcanic hills which
rise upon the Libyan side. On the crest of the low sand-hills they would
catch a glimpse every now and then of a tall, sky-blue soldier, walking
swiftly, his rifle at the trail. For a moment the lank, warlike figure
would be sharply silhouetted against the sky. Then he would dip into a
hollow and disappear, while some hundred yards off another would show
for an instant and vanish.
