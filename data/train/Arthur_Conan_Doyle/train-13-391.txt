      â€œAt the moment, however, we had no thought for the old chest, for
      our eyes were riveted upon that which crouched beside it. It was
      the figure of a man, clad in a suit of black, who squatted down
      upon his hams with his forehead sunk upon the edge of the box and
      his two arms thrown out on each side of it. The attitude had
      drawn all the stagnant blood to the face, and no man could have
      recognised that distorted liver-coloured countenance; but his
      height, his dress, and his hair were all sufficient to show my
      client, when we had drawn the body up, that it was indeed his
      missing butler. He had been dead some days, but there was no
      wound or bruise upon his person to show how he had met his
      dreadful end. When his body had been carried from the cellar we
      found ourselves still confronted with a problem which was almost
      as formidable as that with which we had started.
