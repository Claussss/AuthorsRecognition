Saints of Brittany had risen at their country's call. Already, as he
lay gasping, his heart was pouring forth its thanks to his patron Saint
Cadoc. But the spectators had seen clearly enough the earthly cause of
this sudden victory, and a hurricane of applause from one side, with
a storm of hooting from the other showed how different was the emotion
which it raised in minds which sympathized with the victors or the
vanquished.
