Nigel shook his head, for indeed it seemed hopeless to try to bridge the
gulf between them. Already they had made such good progress along the
bridle-path through the heather that the little hill of Saint Catharine
and the ancient shrine upon its summit loomed up before them. Here
they crossed the road from the south to London, and at the crossing
two wayfarers were waiting who waved their hands in greeting, the one
a tall, slender, dark woman upon a white jennet, the other a very thick
and red-faced old man, whose weight seemed to curve the back of the
stout gray cob which he bestrode.
