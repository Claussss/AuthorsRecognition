      “I think, Inspector,” Holmes remarked, “that you would do well to
      telegraph for an escort, as, if my calculations prove to be
      correct, you may have a particularly dangerous prisoner to convey
      to the county jail. The boy who takes this note could no doubt
      forward your telegram. If there is an afternoon train to town,
      Watson, I think we should do well to take it, as I have a
      chemical analysis of some interest to finish, and this
      investigation draws rapidly to a close.”
