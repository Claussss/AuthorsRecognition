So they were to have a reprieve of a few hours, though they rode in that
dark shadow of death which was closing in upon them. What is there in life that we should cling to it so? It is not the
pleasures, for those whose hours are one long pain shrink away screaming
when they see merciful Death holding his soothing arms out for them. It
is not the associations, for we will change all of them before we walk
of our own free wills down that broad road which every son and daughter
of man must tread. Is it the fear of losing the I, that dear, intimate
I, which we think we know so well, although it is eternally doing things
which surprise us? Is it that which makes the deliberate suicide cling
madly to the bridge-pier as the river sweeps him by? Or is it that
Nature is so afraid that all her weary workmen may suddenly throw down
their tools and strike, that she has invented this fashion of keeping
them constant to their present work? But there it is, and all these
tired, harassed, humiliated folk rejoiced in the few more hours of
suffering which were left to them.
