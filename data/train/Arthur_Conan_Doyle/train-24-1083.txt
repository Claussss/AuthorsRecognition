At the sight of the man Alleyne had stood staring, but at the sound of
his voice such a thrill of joy bubbled up in his heart that he had
to bite his lip to keep himself from shouting outright. But a deeper
pleasure yet was in store. Even as he looked, the window above was
pushed outwards, and the voice of the man whom he had seen there came
out from it. “Aylward,” cried the voice, “I have seen just now a very
worthy person come down the road, though my eyes could scarce discern
whether he carried coat-armor. I pray you to wait upon him and tell him
that a very humble knight of England abides here, so that if he be in
need of advancement, or have any small vow upon his soul, or desire to
exalt his lady, I may help him to accomplish it.”
