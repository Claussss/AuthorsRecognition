      Holmes stood for a moment in deep thought.       “With your permission,” said he at last, “I should like to go
      upstairs and look into the matter.”       We both ascended, followed by the doctor.       It was a dreadful sight which met us as we entered the bedroom
      door. I have spoken of the impression of flabbiness which this
      man Blessington conveyed. As he dangled from the hook it was
      exaggerated and intensified until he was scarce human in his
      appearance. The neck was drawn out like a plucked chicken’s,
      making the rest of him seem the more obese and unnatural by the
      contrast. He was clad only in his long night-dress, and his
      swollen ankles and ungainly feet protruded starkly from beneath
      it. Beside him stood a smart-looking police-inspector, who was
      taking notes in a pocket-book.
