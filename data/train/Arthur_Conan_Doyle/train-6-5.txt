ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE. “UNDERSHAW,” November 30, 1905. 
I. THE HOUSE OF LORING 
In the month of July of the year 1348, between the feasts of St.
Benedict and of St. Swithin, a strange thing came upon England, for out
of the east there drifted a monstrous cloud, purple and piled, heavy
with evil, climbing slowly up the hushed heaven. In the shadow of that
strange cloud the leaves drooped in the trees, the birds ceased their
calling, and the cattle and the sheep gathered cowering under the
hedges. A gloom fell upon all the land, and men stood with their eyes
upon the strange cloud and a heaviness upon their hearts. They crept
into the churches where the trembling people were blessed and shriven by
the trembling priests. Outside no bird flew, and there came no rustling
from the woods, nor any of the homely sounds of Nature. All was still,
and nothing moved, save only the great cloud which rolled up and onward,
with fold on fold from the black horizon. To the west was the light
summer sky, to the east this brooding cloud-bank, creeping ever slowly
across, until the last thin blue gleam faded away and the whole vast
sweep of the heavens was one great leaden arch.
