"Come down!" he gasped.  "Bellingham's ill." Abercrombie Smith followed him closely down stairs into the
sitting-room which was beneath his own, and intent as he was upon the
matter in hand, he could not but take an amazed glance around him as he
crossed the threshold.  It was such a chamber as he had never seen
before--a museum rather than a study.  Walls and ceiling were thickly
covered with a thousand strange relics from Egypt and the East.  Tall,
angular figures bearing burdens or weapons stalked in an uncouth frieze
round the apartments.  Above were bull-headed, stork-headed,
cat-headed, owl-headed statues, with viper-crowned, almond-eyed
monarchs, and strange, beetle-like deities cut out of the blue Egyptian
lapis lazuli.  Horus and Isis and Osiris peeped down from every niche
and shelf, while across the ceiling a true son of Old Nile, a great,
hanging-jawed crocodile, was slung in a double noose.
