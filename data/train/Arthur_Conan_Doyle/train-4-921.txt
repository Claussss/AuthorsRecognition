of them hung old blind Jim Houston of Milverton, who was a friend of
mine. I have sent seven of the red-handed rogues to their last account
for it, and might work through the whole regiment had I time. But I will
not fight against King James, nor will I risk the mare, so let me hear
no more of it. And now I must leave ye, for I have much to do. Farewell
to you!’
