And Giant Maximin--what of him? He had carried his eight feet of manhood
through the lowlands of Scotland and the passes of the Grampians. He
had seen Severus pass away, and had soldiered with his son. He had
fought in Armenia, in Dacia, and in Germany. They had made him a
centurion upon the field when with his hands he plucked out one by one
the stockades of a northern village, and so cleared a path for the
stormers. His strength had been the jest and the admiration of the
soldiers. Legends about him had spread through the army, and were the
common gossip round the camp fires--of his duel with the German axe-man
on the Island of the Rhine, and of the blow with his fist that broke the
leg of a Scythian's horse. Gradually he had won his way upwards, until
now, after quarter of a century's service, he was tribune of the fourth
legion and superintendent of recruits for the whole army. The young
soldier who had come under the glare of Maximin's eyes, or had been
lifted up with one huge hand while he was cuffed by the other, had his
first lesson from him in the discipline of the service.
