      The path has been cut half-way round the fall to afford a
      complete view, but it ends abruptly, and the traveler has to
      return as he came. We had turned to do so, when we saw a Swiss
      lad come running along it with a letter in his hand. It bore the
      mark of the hotel which we had just left, and was addressed to me
      by the landlord. It appeared that within a very few minutes of
      our leaving, an English lady had arrived who was in the last
      stage of consumption. She had wintered at Davos Platz, and was
      journeying now to join her friends at Lucerne, when a sudden
      hemorrhage had overtaken her. It was thought that she could
      hardly live a few hours, but it would be a great consolation to
      her to see an English doctor, and, if I would only return, etc.
      The good Steiler assured me in a postscript that he would himself
      look upon my compliance as a very great favour, since the lady
      absolutely refused to see a Swiss physician, and he could not but
      feel that he was incurring a great responsibility.
