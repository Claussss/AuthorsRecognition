“When the lamps were lit,” said the butler. “It would be shortly after
four.” “Someone had been hiding here, sure enough.” He held down the light, and
the marks of muddy boots were very visible in the corner. “I'm bound to
say this bears out your theory, Mr. Barker. It looks as if the man got
into the house after four when the curtains were drawn, and before six
when the bridge was raised. He slipped into this room, because it was
the first that he saw. There was no other place where he could hide,
so he popped in behind this curtain. That all seems clear enough. It
is likely that his main idea was to burgle the house; but Mr. Douglas
chanced to come upon him, so he murdered him and escaped.”
