"That's Peterson," whispered the senior. "The big, bald man in the front
row. He's the skin-grafting man, you know. And that's Anthony Browne,
who took a larynx out successfully last winter. And there's Murphy the
pathologist, and Stoddart the eye man. You'll come to know them all
soon." "Who are the two men at the table?" "Nobody--dressers. One has charge of the instruments and the other of
the puffing Billy. It's Lister's antiseptic spray, you know, and
Archer's one of the carbolic acid men. Hayes is the leader of the
cleanliness-and-cold-water school, and they all hate each other like
poison."
