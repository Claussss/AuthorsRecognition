Here is Flammarion's "L'Atmosphere"--a very gorgeous though
weather-stained copy in faded scarlet and gold. The book has a small
history, and I value it. A young Frenchman, dying of fever on the
west coast of Africa, gave it to me as a professional fee. The sight
of it takes me back to a little ship's bunk, and a sallow face with
large, sad eyes looking out at me. Poor boy, I fear that he never
saw his beloved Marseilles again!
