My road lay through Shepton Mallet, Piper’s Inn, Bridgewater, and North
Petherton, until in the cool of the evening I pulled up my weary horse
at the Cross Hands, and saw the towers of Taunton in the valley beneath
me. A flagon of beer for the rider, and a sieveful of oats for the
steed, put fresh mettle into both of us, and we were jogging on our way
once more, when there came galloping down the side of the hill about
forty cavaliers, as hard as their horses could carry them. So wild was
their riding that I pulled up, uncertain whether they were friend or
foe, until, as they came whirling towards me, I recognised that the two
officers who rode in front of them were none other than Reuben Lockarby
and Sir Gervas Jerome. At the sight of me they flung up their hands, and
Reuben shot on to his horse’s neck, where he sat for a moment astride of
the mane, until the brute tossed him back into the saddle.
