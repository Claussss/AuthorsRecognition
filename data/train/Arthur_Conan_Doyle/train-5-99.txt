But the young baronet gave a cry of impatience and disgust.  "Words,
words, words!  You can sit comfortably there in your chair and say
them--and think them too, no doubt.  You've had your life, but I've
never had mine.  You've healthy blood in your veins; mine is putrid.
And yet I am as innocent as you.  What would words do for you if you
were in this chair and I in that?  Ah, it's such a mockery and a
make-believe!  Don't think me rude, though, doctor.  I don't mean to be
that.  I only say that it is impossible for you or any other man to
realise it.  But I've a question to ask you, doctor.  It's one on which
my whole life must depend."  He writhed his fingers together in an
agony of apprehension.
