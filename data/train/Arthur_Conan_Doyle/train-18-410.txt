“Why punishment should come on those days only it does not concern
you to know. Suffice it that you are the murderer of Ghoolab Shah,
the thrice blessed, and that I am the senior of his three _chelas_
commissioned to avenge his death. “It is no personal matter between us. Amid our studies we have no
leisure or inclination for personal matters. It is an immutable law, and
it is as impossible for us to relax it as it is for you to escape from
it. Sooner or later we shall come to you and claim your life in atonement
for the one which you have taken.
