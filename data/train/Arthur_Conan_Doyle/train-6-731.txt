Such would have been the fate of the stranger, as of so many cavaliers
before him, had Nigel not chanced to be close upon his heels. In an
instant Pommers had burst through the group who struck at the prostrate
man, and in another two of the robbers had fallen before Nigel's sword.
A spear rang on his breastplate, but one blow shore off its head, and
a second that of him who held it. In vain they thrust at the steel-girt
man. His sword played round them like lightning, and the fierce horse
ramped and swooped above them with pawing iron-shod hoofs and eyes of
fire. With cries and shrieks they flew off to right and left amidst
the bushes, springing over boulders and darting under branches where
no horseman could follow them. The foul crew had gone as swiftly and
suddenly as it had come, and save for four ragged figures littered
amongst the trampled bushes, no sign remaining of their passing.
