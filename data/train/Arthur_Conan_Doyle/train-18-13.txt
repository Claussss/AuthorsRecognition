Empty and mildewed, it served only as a landmark to the fishermen, for
they had found by experience that by keeping the laird's chimney and the
white tower of Cloomber in a line they could steer their way through
the ugly reef which raises its jagged back, like that of some sleeping
monster, above the troubled waters of the wind-swept bay. To this wild spot it was that Fate had brought my father, my sister,
and myself. For us its loneliness had no terrors. After the hubbub and
bustle of a great city, and the weary task of upholding appearances upon
a slender income, there was a grand, soul-soothing serenity in the long
sky-line and the eager air. Here at least there was no neighbour to pry
and chatter.
