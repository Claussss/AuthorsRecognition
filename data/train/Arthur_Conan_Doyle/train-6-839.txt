The Squire flushed with pleasure. “Do you send a messenger home to
England, fair sir, with news of these doings?” “Surely, I must do so. But do not tell me, Nigel, that you would be that
messenger. Ask me some other favor, for indeed I cannot let you go.” “Now God forbid!” cried Nigel. “By Saint Paul! I would not be so caitiff
and so thrall as to leave you, when some small deed might still be done.
But I would fain send a message by your messenger.”
