So much, for the moment, for my two white companions, whose characters
and limitations will be further exposed, as surely as my own, as this

may play no small part in what is to come.  The first is a gigantic
negro named Zambo, who is a black Hercules, as willing as any horse,
and about as intelligent.  Him we enlisted at Para, on the
recommendation of the steamship company, on whose vessels he had
learned to speak a halting English.
