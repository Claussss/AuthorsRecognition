      “I confess, my dear Watson, that that does not appeal to me as a
      very probable explanation. It struck me, however, as being the
      one which was most likely to interest that exceedingly unpleasant
      old person.”       “It certainly did that; but what are your alternatives?”       “I could mention several. You must admit that it is curious and
      suggestive that this incident should occur on the eve of this
      important match, and should involve the only man whose presence
      seems essential to the success of the side. It may, of course, be
      a coincidence, but it is interesting. Amateur sport is free from
      betting, but a good deal of outside betting goes on among the
      public, and it is possible that it might be worth someone’s while

      however modest his means may at present be, and it is not
      impossible that a plot to hold him for ransom might be
      concocted.”
