      me know if you do any good.”       “Certainly,” answered my friend, rising from his chair. “I’ll let
      you know, and Mr. Melas also. In the meantime, Mr. Melas, I
      should certainly be on my guard, if I were you, for of course
      they must know through these advertisements that you have
      betrayed them.”
