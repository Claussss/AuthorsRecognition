“Bring wine, Nicholas!” cried the King. “Gentlemen, ere you close your
visors I pray you to take a last rouse with me. You will be dry enough,
I promise you, before your lips are free once more. To what shall we
drink, John?” “To the men of Spain,” said Chandos, his sharp face peering like a gaunt
bird through the gap in his helmet. “May their hearts be stout and their
spirits high this day!” “Well said, John!” cried the King, and the knights laughed joyously as
they drank. “Now, fair sirs, let each to his post! I am warden here on
the forecastle. Do you, John, take charge of the afterguard. Walter,
James, William, Fitzallan, Goldesborough, Reginald--you will stay with
me! John, you may pick whom you will and the others will bide with the
archers. Now bear straight at the center, master-shipman. Ere yonder
sun sets we will bring a red ship back as a gift to our ladies, or never
look upon a lady's face again.”
