“How far do you suppose we are from the Nile?” asked Cochrane. He rode
with his chin on his shoulder and his eyes straining wistfully to the
eastern sky-line. “A good fifty miles,” Belmont answered. “Not so much as that,” said the Colonel. “We could not have been moving
more than fourteen or fifteen hours, and a camel seldom goes more than
two and a half miles an hour unless he is trotting. That would give
about forty miles, but still it is, I fear, rather far for a rescue. I
don't know that we are much the better for this postponement. What have
we to hope for? We may just as well take our gruel.”
