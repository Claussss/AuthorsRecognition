      On the evening of our arrival we were sitting in the Colonel’s
      gun-room after dinner, Holmes stretched upon the sofa, while
      Hayter and I looked over his little armoury of fire-arms.       “By the way,” said he suddenly, “I think I’ll take one of these
      pistols upstairs with me in case we have an alarm.”       “An alarm!” said I.       “Yes, we’ve had a scare in this part lately. Old Acton, who is
      one of our county magnates, had his house broken into last
      Monday. No great damage done, but the fellows are still at
      large.”
