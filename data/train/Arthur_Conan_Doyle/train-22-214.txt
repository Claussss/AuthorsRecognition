“This is what we are after, Mr. Barker--this bundle, weighted with a
dumb-bell, which you have just raised from the bottom of the moat.” Barker stared at Holmes with amazement in his face. “How in thunder came
you to know anything about it?” he asked. “Simply that I put it there.” “You put it there! You!” “Perhaps I should have said 'replaced it there,'” said Holmes. “You will
remember, Inspector MacDonald, that I was somewhat struck by the absence
of a dumb-bell. I drew your attention to it; but with the pressure of
other events you had hardly the time to give it the consideration which
would have enabled you to draw deductions from it. When water is near
and a weight is missing it is not a very far-fetched supposition that
something has been sunk in the water. The idea was at least worth
testing; so with the help of Ames, who admitted me to the room, and the
crook of Dr. Watson's umbrella, I was able last night to fish up and
inspect this bundle.
