“I was going to propose it, Mr. Holmes; but I thought it well to put you

plays the game.” “My own idea of the game, at any rate,” said Holmes, with a smile. “I go
into a case to help the ends of justice and the work of the police. If
I have ever separated myself from the official force, it is because they
have first separated themselves from me. I have no wish ever to score at
their expense. At the same time, Mr. White Mason, I claim the right to
work in my own way and give my results at my own time--complete rather
than in stages.”
