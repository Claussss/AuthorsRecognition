what can be done with fear.  You smile, but the day will come when you
will come screaming to me for pardon.  Yes, you will grovel on the

ever you turned me from your best friend into your most bitter enemy.
Have a care, Professor Gilroy!" I saw a white hand shaking in the air,
and a face which was scarcely human, so convulsed was it with passion.
An instant later she was gone, and I heard the quick hobble and tap
receding down the passage.
