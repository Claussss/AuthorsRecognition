Aylward's words were speedily justified, for even as he spoke the two
knights met in the centre of the lists. Beauchamp struck his opponent a
shrewd blow upon the helmet, but was met with so frightful a thrust that
he whirled out of his saddle and rolled over and over upon the ground.
Sir Thomas Percy met with little better success, for his shield was
split, his vambrace torn and he himself wounded slightly in the side.
Lord Audley and the unknown knight struck each other fairly upon the
helmet; but, while the stranger sat as firm and rigid as ever upon his
charger, the Englishman was bent back to his horse's cropper by the
weight of the blow, and had galloped half-way down the lists ere he
could recover himself. Sir Thomas Wake was beaten to the ground with a
battle-axe--that being the weapon which he had selected--and had to be
carried to his pavilion. These rapid successes, gained one after the
other over four celebrated warriors, worked the crowd up to a pitch of
wonder and admiration. Thunders of applause from the English soldiers,
as well as from the citizens and peasants, showed how far the love of
brave and knightly deeds could rise above the rivalries of race.
