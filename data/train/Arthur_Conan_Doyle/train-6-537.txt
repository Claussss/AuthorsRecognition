Once it seemed that all was over with the Squire, for in springing back
from his enemy he tripped over one of the bodies which strewed the deck
and fell flat upon his back, but with a swift wriggle he escaped the
heavy blow which thundered down upon him, and springing to his feet he
bit deeply into the Frenchman's helmet with a sweeping cut in return.
Again the mace fell, and this time Nigel had not quite cleared himself.
His sword was beaten down and the blow fell partly upon his left
shoulder. He staggered, and once more the iron club whirled upward to
dash him to the ground.
