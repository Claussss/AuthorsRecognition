On the day which followed his interview with Monkhouse Lee, Smith shut
up his books at a quarter past eight, the hour when he usually started
for his friend's house.  As he was leaving his room, however, his eyes
chanced to fall upon one of the books which Bellingham had lent him,
and his conscience pricked him for not having returned it.  However
repellent the man might be, he should not be treated with discourtesy.
Taking the book, he walked downstairs and knocked at his neighbour's
door.  There was no answer; but on turning the handle he found that it
was unlocked.  Pleased at the thought of avoiding an interview, he
stepped inside, and placed the book with his card upon the table.
