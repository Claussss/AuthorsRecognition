Inspector MacDonald had been staring at the newcomer with the greatest
amazement. “Well, this fairly beats me!” he cried at last. “If you
are Mr. John Douglas of Birlstone Manor, then whose death have we been
investigating for these two days, and where in the world have you
sprung from now? You seemed to me to come out of the floor like a
jack-in-a-box.” “Ah, Mr. Mac,” said Holmes, shaking a reproving forefinger, “you
would not read that excellent local compilation which described the
concealment of King Charles. People did not hide in those days without
excellent hiding places, and the hiding place that has once been used
may be again. I had persuaded myself that we should find Mr. Douglas
under this roof.”
