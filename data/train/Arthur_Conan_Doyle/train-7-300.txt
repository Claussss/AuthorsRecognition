It was shocking to the ladies to look at their companion and to think
of the spruce, hale old soldier who had been their fellow-passenger from
Cairo. As in the case of Miss Adams, old age seemed to have pounced upon
him in one spring. His hair, which had grizzled hour by hour during his
privations, was now of a silvery white. White stubble, too, had obscured
the firm, clean line of his chin and throat. The veins of his face were
injected and his features were shot with heavy wrinkles. He rode
with his back arched and his chin sunk upon his breast, for the old,
time-rotted body was worn out, but in his bright, alert eyes there was
always a trace of the gallant tenant who lived in the shattered house.
Delirious, spent, and dying, he preserved his chivalrous, protecting
air as he turned to the ladies, shot little scraps of advice and
encouragement at them, and peered back continually for the help which
never came.
