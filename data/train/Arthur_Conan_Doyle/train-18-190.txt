“No danger, eh?” he said. “There never is any danger for me. I am as
hard to kill as the Wandering Jew. I am quite clear in the head now,
Mary; so you may leave me with the doctor.” Mrs. Heatherstone left the room--rather unwillingly, as I thought--and
I sat down by the bedside to listen to anything which my patient might
have to communicate. “I want you to examine my liver,” he said when the door was closed. “I
used to have an abscess there, and Brodie, the staff-surgeon, said that
it was ten to one that it would carry me off. I have not felt much of it
since I left the East. This is where it used to be, just under the angle
of the ribs.”
