      We approached the door; but suddenly a woman appeared out of the
      shadow and stood in the golden track of the lamp-light. I could
      not see her face in the darkness, but her arms were thrown out in
      an attitude of entreaty.       “For God’s sake, don’t Jack!” she cried. “I had a presentiment
      that you would come this evening. Think better of it, dear! Trust
      me again, and you will never have cause to regret it.”
