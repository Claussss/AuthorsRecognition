A telegram was awaiting us when we reached our Baker Street rooms,
which Holmes read with an exclamation of interest and threw across to
me. “Jagged or torn,” was the message, and the place of origin, Baden. “What is this?” I asked. “It is everything,” Holmes answered. “You may remember my seemingly
irrelevant question as to this clerical gentleman’s left ear. You did
not answer it.” “I had left Baden and could not inquire.”
