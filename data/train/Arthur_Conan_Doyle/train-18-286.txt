The place had the same dreary and melancholy appearance which always
characterised it. Looking through between the thick iron bars of the
main gateway there was nothing to be seen of any of the occupants. One
of the great Scotch firs had been blown down in the gale, and its long,
ruddy trunk lay right across the grass-grown avenue; but no attempt had
been made to remove it. Everything about the property had the same air of desolation and
neglect, with the solitary exception of the massive and impenetrable
fencing, which presented as unbroken and formidable an obstacle as ever
to the would-be trespasser.
