      â€œOld Trevor was evidently a man of some wealth and consideration,
      a J.P. and a landed proprietor. Donnithorpe is a little hamlet
      just to the north of Langmere, in the country of the Broads. The
      house was an old-fashioned, wide-spread, oak-beamed brick
      building, with a fine lime-lined avenue leading up to it. There
      was excellent wild-duck shooting in the fens, remarkably good
      fishing, a small but select library, taken over, as I understood,
      from a former occupant, and a tolerable cook, so that he would be
      a fastidious man who could not put in a pleasant month there.
