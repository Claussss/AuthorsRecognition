      powder barrel, which was one of a hundred carried on board, and
      swearing that he would blow all hands up if he were in any way
      molested. An instant later the explosion occurred, though Hudson
      thought it was caused by the misdirected bullet of one of the
      convicts rather than the mate’s match. Be the cause what it may,
      it was the end of the _Gloria Scott_ and of the rabble who held
      command of her.
