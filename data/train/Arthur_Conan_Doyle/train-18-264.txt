I could not help contrasting our hurried and tumultuous advance with the
gravity and dignity of this lonely Oriental, nor was the matter mended
when he raised a pair of steady, thoughtful dark eyes and inclined his
head in a graceful, sweeping salutation. It seemed to me that we were
like a pack of schoolboys in the presence of a master. The stranger's broad, unruffled brow, his clear, searching gaze,
firm-set yet sensitive mouth, and clean-cut, resolute expression, all
combined to form the most imposing and noble presence which I had ever
known. I could not have imagined that such imperturbable calm and at
the same time such a consciousness of latent strength could have been
expressed by any human face.
