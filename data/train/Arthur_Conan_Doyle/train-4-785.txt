‘My sword?’ I asked. ‘All your property is there. Tell Monmouth what I have said, and let him
know that I have used you as kindly as was possible.’ ‘But what will your Grace’s council say when they find that I am gone?’
I asked. ‘Pshaw, man! Never fret about that! I will off to Bristol at daybreak,
and give my council enough to think of without their having time to
devote to your fate. The soldiers will but have another instance of
the working of the Father of Evil, who hath long been thought to have a
weakness for that cell beneath us. Faith, if all we hear be true, there
have been horrors enough acted there to call up every devil out of the
pit. But time presses. Gently through the casement! So! Remember the
message.’
