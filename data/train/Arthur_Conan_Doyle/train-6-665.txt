“How now, fellow?” asked Knolles. “What is this I hear? Is it indeed
sooth that you have been a captive upon this island?” “It is true, fair sir. For eight months I have been servant to the man
whom they call their King. His name is La Muette, and he comes from
Jersey nor is there under God's sky a man whom I have more desire to
see.” “Has he then mishandled you?” Black Simon gave a wry smile and pulled off his jerkin. His lean sinewy
back was waled and puckered with white scars. “He has left his sign of
hand upon me,” said he. “He swore that he would break me to his will,
and thus he tried to do it. But most I desire to see him because he hath
lost a wager to me and I would fain be paid.”
