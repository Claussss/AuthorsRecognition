These mere domestic episodes are, as I have already explained,
introduced only because I cannot avoid alluding to them. My object in drawing up this statement and publishing the evidence which
corroborates it, was certainly not to parade my private affairs before
the public, but to leave on record an authentic narrative of a most
remarkable series of events. This I have endeavoured to do in as
methodical a manner as possible, exaggerating nothing and suppressing
nothing.
