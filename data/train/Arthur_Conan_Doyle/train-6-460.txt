That night they slept in a sordid inn, overrun with rats and with fleas,
one mile south of the hamlet of Mayfield. Aylward scratched vigorously
and cursed with fervor. Nigel lay without movement or sound. To the man
who had learned the old rule of chivalry there were no small ills in
life. It was beneath the dignity of his soul to stoop to observe them.
Cold and heat, hunger and thirst, such things did not exist for the
gentleman. The armor of his soul was so complete that it was proof not
only against the great ills of life but even against the small ones; so
the flea-bitten Nigel lay grimly still while Aylward writhed upon his
couch.
