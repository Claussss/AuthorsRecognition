"Please don't recall my idiotic expression." "I feel so pleased that I should have helped in changing your views. I
think that it is the most sincere compliment that I have ever had paid
me." "At any rate, it is the truth," said he, and was happy all night at the
remembrance of the flush of pleasure which made her pale face look quite
comely for the instant. For, indeed, he was already far past the stage when he would acknowledge
her as the equal of any other woman. Already he could not disguise from
himself that she had become the one woman. Her dainty skill, her gentle
touch, her sweet presence, the community of their tastes, had all united
to hopelessly upset his previous opinions. It was a dark day for him now
when his convalescence allowed her to miss a visit, and darker still
that other one which he saw approaching when all occasion for her visits
would be at an end. It came round at last, however, and he felt that his
whole life's fortune would hang upon the issue of that final interview.
He was a direct man by nature, so he laid his hand upon hers as it felt
for his pulse, and he asked her if she would be his wife.
