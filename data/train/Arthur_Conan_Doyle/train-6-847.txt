Supper had been set in the hall of Ploermel wherein the knights and
squires assembled. Bambro' and Croquart were there with Sir Hugh
Calverly, an old friend of Knolles and a fellow-townsman, for both were
men of Chester. Sir Hugh was a middle-sized flaxen man, with hard
gray eyes and fierce large-nosed face sliced across with the scar of a
sword-cut. There too were Geoffrey D'Ardaine, a young Breton seigneur,
Sir Thomas Belford, a burly thick-set Midland Englishman, Sir Thomas
Walton, whose surcoat of scarlet martlets showed that he was of the
Surrey Waltons, James Marshall and John Russell, young English squires,
and the two brothers, Richard and Hugh Le Galliard, who were of Gascon
blood. Besides these were several squires, unknown to fame, and of the
new-comers, Sir Robert Knolles, Sir Thomas Percy, Nigel Loring and
two other squires, Allington and Parsons. These were the company
who gathered in the torch-light round the table of the Seneschal of
Ploermel, and kept high revel with joyous hearts because they thought
that much honor and noble deeds lay before them.
