It has been our fate, among all the innumerable generations of mankind,
to face the most frightful calamity that has ever befallen the world.
There is a basic fact which cannot be denied, and should not be
overlooked.  For a most important deduction must immediately follow
from it.  That deduction is that we, who have borne the pains, shall
also learn the lesson which they were intended to convey.  If we do not
learn it and proclaim it, then when can it ever be learned and
proclaimed, since there can never again be such a spiritual ploughing
and harrowing and preparation for the seed?  If our souls, wearied and
tortured during these dreadful five years of self-sacrifice and
suspense, can show no radical changes, then what souls will ever
respond to a fresh influx of heavenly inspiration?  In that case the
state of the human race would indeed be hopeless, and never in all the
coming centuries would there be any prospect of improvement.
