As I glanced from time to time at his noble profile and the sweep of his
jet-black beard, his rough-spun tweed travelling suit struck me with
an almost painful sense of incongruity, and I re-clothed him in my
imagination with the grand, sweeping Oriental costume which is the
fitting and proper frame for such a picture--the only garb which does
not detract from the dignity and grace of the wearer. The place to which he led me was a small fisher cottage which had been
deserted some years before by its tenant, but still stood gaunt and
bare, with the thatch partly blown away and the windows and doors in
sad disrepair. This dwelling, which the poorest Scotch beggar would have
shrunk from, was the one which these singular men had preferred to the
proffered hospitality of the laird's house. A small garden, now a mass
of tangled brambles, stood round it, and through this my acquaintance
picked his way to the ruined door. He glanced into the house and then
waved his hand for me to follow him.
