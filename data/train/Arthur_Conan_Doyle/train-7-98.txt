But the people upon the rock had no time to think of the cruel fate of
the donkey-boys. Even the Colonel, after that first indignant outburst,
had forgotten all about them. The advancing camel-men had trotted to the
bottom of the hill, had dismounted, and, leaving their camels kneeling,
had rushed furiously onward. Fifty of them were clambering up the path
and over the rocks together, their red turbans appearing and vanishing
again as they scrambled over the boulders. Without a shot or a pause
they surged over the three black soldiers, killing one and stamping
the other two down under their hurrying feet. So they burst on to the
plateau at the top, where an unexpected resistance checked them for an
instant.
