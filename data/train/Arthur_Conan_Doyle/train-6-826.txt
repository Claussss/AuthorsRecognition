Oh, the buzz of joy and of prayer from all those white lips! Oh, the
light of returning hope in all those sunken weary eyes! One wild shout
would have gone up had not Nigel's outstretched hands and warning voice
hushed them to silence. He opened the door behind him. A curving newel staircase wound upward
into the darkness. He listened, but no sound came down. There was a key
in the outer lock of the iron door. He whipped it out and turned it on
the inner side. The ground that they had gained was safe. Now they could
turn to the relief of these poor fellows beside them. A few strong blows
struck off the irons and freed the three dancers before the fire. With a
husky croak of joy, they rushed across to their comrades' water-barrels,
plunged their heads in like horses, and drank and drank and drank. Then
in turn the poor shivering wretches were taken out of the barrels, their
skins bleached and wrinkled with long soaking. Their bonds were torn
from them; but, cramped and fixed, their limbs refused to act, and they
tumbled and twisted upon the floor in their efforts to reach Nigel and
to kiss his hand.
