To the west was the broad, yellow beach and the Irish Sea, while in all
other directions the desolate moors, greyish-green in the foreground
and purple in the distance, stretched away in long, low curves to the
horizon. Very bleak and lonely it was upon this Wigtown coast. A man might
walk many a weary mile and never see a living thing except the white,
heavy-flapping kittiwakes, which screamed and cried to each other with
their shrill, sad voices.
