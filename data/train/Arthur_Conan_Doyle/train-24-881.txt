among them,” observed Sir Nigel. “They are men from whom, had they been
of better birth, much honor and advancement might be gained. Even as it
is, it is a great pleasure to have seen them. But what is this that they
are bringing forward?” “It is as I feared,” growled Du Guesclin. “They will burn us out, since
they cannot win their way past us. Shoot straight and hard, archers;
for, by St. Ives! our good swords are of little use to us.”
