I stood for an instant with the key in my hand and my head in a whirl.
Then I handed it back to her. “I cannot do it,” I said. “I have given my parole.” “To whom?” she asked. “Why, to you.” “And I release you from it.” My heart bounded with joy. Of course, it was true what she said. I
had refused to give my parole to Sergine. I owed him no duty. If she
relieved me from my promise my honour was clear. I took the key from her
hand.
