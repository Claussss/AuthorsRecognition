Revision is, indeed, needed, and as I have already pleaded, a change of
emphasis is also needed, in order to get the grand Christian conception
back into the current of reason and progress.  The orthodox who,
whether from humble faith or some other cause, do not look deeply into
such matters, can hardly conceive the stumbling-blocks which are
littered about before the feet of their more critical brethren.  What
is easy, for faith is impossible for reflection.  Such expressions as
"Saved by the blood of the Lamb" or "Baptised by His precious blood"
fill their souls with a gentle and sweet emotion, while upon a more
thoughtful mind they have a very different effect.
