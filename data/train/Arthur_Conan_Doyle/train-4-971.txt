opening his eyes. ‘A higher power than ours has judged him, Reuben,’ I answered. ‘Poor devil! He has had much to embitter him,’ he murmured, and
straightway fainted again. As I knelt over him, marking the lad’s white
face and laboured breathing, and bethought me of his simple, kindly
nature and of the affection which I had done so little to deserve, I am
not ashamed to say, my dears, albeit I am a man somewhat backward in my
emotions, that my tears were mingled with his blood.
