“Nay, that is another matter,” said the sacrist. “The question of debt
may indeed be an affair of a civil court. But it is a crime against the
law and an act of the Devil, which comes within the jurisdiction of the
Abbey Court of Waverley when you dare to lay hands upon the summoner or
his papers.” “Indeed, he speaks truth,” cried the official. “I know no blacker sin.” “Therefore,” said the stern monk, “it is the order of the holy father
Abbot that you sleep this night in the Abbey cell, and that to-morrow
you be brought before him at the court held in the chapter-house so that
you receive the fit punishment for this and the many other violent and
froward deeds which you have wrought upon the servants of Holy Church.
Enough is now said, worthy master summoner. Archers, remove your
prisoner!”
