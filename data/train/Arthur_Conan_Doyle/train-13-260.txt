      “You look ill, Mr. Pinner!” he exclaimed.       “Yes, I am not very well,” answered the other, making obvious
      efforts to pull himself together, and licking his dry lips before
      he spoke. “Who are these gentlemen whom you have brought with
      you?”       “One is Mr. Harris, of Bermondsey, and the other is Mr. Price, of
      this town,” said our clerk, glibly. “They are friends of mine and
      gentlemen of experience, but they have been out of a place for
      some little time, and they hoped that perhaps you might find an
      opening for them in the company’s employment.”
