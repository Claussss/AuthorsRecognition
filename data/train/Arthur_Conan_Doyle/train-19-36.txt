We had the most interesting conversation about her own powers.  It is
just as well to put her views on record, though they cannot, of course,
claim any scientific weight. "You are on the very fringe of the subject," said she, when I had
expressed wonder at the remarkable instance of suggestion which she had
shown me.  "I had no direct influence upon Miss Marden when she came
round to you.  I was not even thinking of her that morning.  What I did
was to set her mind as I might set the alarum of a clock so that at the
hour named it would go off of its own accord.  If six months instead of
twelve hours had been suggested, it would have been the same."
