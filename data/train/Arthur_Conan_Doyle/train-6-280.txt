Frenchman at Caen. Will you not be our champion now?” “When I fought the Frenchman, Walter, it was with naked weapons,” said
the knight sternly. “I am a soldier and I love a soldier's work, but I
care not for these tiltyard tricks which were invented for nothing but
to tickle the fancies of foolish women.” “Oh, most ungallant speech!” cried the King. “Had my good-consort heard
you she would have arraigned you to appear at a Court of Love with
a jury of virgins to answer for your sins. But I pray you to take a
tilting spear, good Sir Hubert!”
