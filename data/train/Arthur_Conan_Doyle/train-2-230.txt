“Why half, Holmes?” “It is not for me, my dear Watson, to stand in the way of the official
police force. I leave them all the evidence which I found. The poison
still remained upon the talc had they the wit to find it. Now, Watson,
we will light our lamp; we will, however, take the precaution to open
our window to avoid the premature decease of two deserving members of
society, and you will seat yourself near that open window in an
armchair unless, like a sensible man, you determine to have nothing to
do with the affair. Oh, you will see it out, will you? I thought I knew
my Watson. This chair I will place opposite yours, so that we may be
the same distance from the poison and face to face. The door we will
leave ajar. Each is now in a position to watch the other and to bring
the experiment to an end should the symptoms seem alarming. Is that all
clear? Well, then, I take our powder—or what remains of it—from the
envelope, and I lay it above the burning lamp. So! Now, Watson, let us
sit down and await developments.”
