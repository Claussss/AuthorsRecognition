“I can hear you, Simon.” “Andreas says that some one comes.” “Then cover over the hole,” came the answer. “Quick, I pray you, cover
it over!” A mantle was stretched across it, so that no glimmer of light should
warn the new-comer. The fear was that he might have heard, the sound
of Nigel's descent. But soon it was clear that he had not done so, for
Andreas announced that he was still advancing. Presently Nigel could
hear the distant thud of his feet. If he bore a lantern all was lost.
But no gleam of light appeared in the black tunnel, and still the
footsteps drew nearer.
