      “Indeed! And anyone else?”       “There were many insignificant sums to individuals, and a large
      number of public charities. The residue all went to Sir Henry.”       “And how much was the residue?”       “Seven hundred and forty thousand pounds.”       Holmes raised his eyebrows in surprise. “I had no idea that so
      gigantic a sum was involved,” said he.       “Sir Charles had the reputation of being rich, but we did not
      know how very rich he was until we came to examine his
      securities. The total value of the estate was close on to a
      million.”
