      “My first feeling, as I have just said, was one of pity and
      horror. My second, I fear, was rather one of professional
      satisfaction. I made notes of my patient’s pulse and temperature,
      tested the rigidity of his muscles, and examined his reflexes.
      There was nothing markedly abnormal in any of these conditions,
      which harmonised with my former experiences. I had obtained good
      results in such cases by the inhalation of nitrite of amyl, and
      the present seemed an admirable opportunity of testing its
      virtues. The bottle was downstairs in my laboratory, so leaving
      my patient seated in his chair, I ran down to get it. There was
      some little delay in finding it—five minutes, let us say—and then
      I returned. Imagine my amazement to find the room empty and the
      patient gone.
