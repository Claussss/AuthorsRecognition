The man was a primitive savage from the backwoods of San Pedro, and
this was his fetish.  When his companion and he had fled to some

to it next day, when, on reconnoitering through the window, he found
policeman Walters in possession.  He waited three days longer, and then
his piety or his superstition drove him to try once more.  Inspector
