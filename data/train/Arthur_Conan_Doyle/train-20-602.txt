      “Who?”       “Why, Bannister, the servant. What’s his game in the matter?”       “He impressed me as being a perfectly honest man.”       “So he did me. That’s the puzzling part. Why should a perfectly
      honest man—well, well, here’s a large stationer’s. We shall begin
      our researches here.”       There were only four stationers of any consequences in the town,
      and at each Holmes produced his pencil chips, and bid high for a
      duplicate. All were agreed that one could be ordered, but that it
      was not a usual size of pencil and that it was seldom kept in
      stock. My friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure,
      but shrugged his shoulders in half-humorous resignation.
