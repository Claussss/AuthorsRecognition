With his whip he began to trace a plan of the Scottish battle upon the
dust, and Nigel with knitted brows was trying hard to muster his small
stock of brains and to profit by the lecture, when their conversation
was interrupted by a strange new arrival. It was a very stout little man, wheezy and purple with haste, who
scudded down the rampart as if he were blown by the wind, his grizzled
hair flying and his long black gown floating behind him. He was clad in
the dress of a respectable citizen, a black jerkin trimmed with sable, a
black-velvet beaver hat and a white feather. At the sight of Chandos
he gave a cry of joy and quickened his pace so that when he did at last
reach him he could only stand gasping and waving his hands.
