      I looked at the clock. It was a quarter to twelve. This could not
      be a visitor at so late an hour. A patient, evidently, and
      possibly an all-night sitting. With a wry face I went out into
      the hall and opened the door. To my astonishment it was Sherlock
      Holmes who stood upon my step.       “Ah, Watson,” said he, “I hoped that I might not be too late to
      catch you.”
