“I am little hurt, fair lord, save for a crushed hand and a spear-prick
in the shoulder. But you, sir? I trust you have no scathe?” “In truth, John, with you at one elbow and Lord Audley at the other, I
know not how I could come to harm. But alas! I fear that Sir James is
sorely stricken.” The gallant Lord Audley had dropped upon the ground and the blood oozed
from every crevice of his battered armor. His four brave Squires--Dutton
of Dutton, Delves of Doddington, Fowlhurst of Crewe and Hawkstone of
Wainhill--wounded and weary themselves, but with no thought save for
their master, unlaced his helmet and bathed his pallid blood-stained
face.
