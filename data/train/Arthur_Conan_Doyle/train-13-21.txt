      “On being arrested he volunteered the statement that he had come
      down to Dartmoor in the hope of getting some information about
      the King’s Pyland horses, and also about Desborough, the second
      favourite, which was in charge of Silas Brown at the Mapleton
      stables. He did not attempt to deny that he had acted as
      described upon the evening before, but declared that he had no
      sinister designs, and had simply wished to obtain first-hand
      information. When confronted with his cravat, he turned very
      pale, and was utterly unable to account for its presence in the
      hand of the murdered man. His wet clothing showed that he had
      been out in the storm of the night before, and his stick, which
      was a Penang-lawyer weighted with lead, was just such a weapon as
      might, by repeated blows, have inflicted the terrible injuries to
      which the trainer had succumbed.
