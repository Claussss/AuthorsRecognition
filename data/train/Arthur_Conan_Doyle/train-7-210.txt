“What makes it white, then?” “The bones.” It seemed incredible, and yet it was true, for as they drew nearer they
saw that it was indeed a beaten track across the desert, hollowed out by
long usage, and so covered with bones that they gave the impression of
a continuous white ribbon. Long, snouty heads were scattered everywhere,
and the lines of ribs were so continuous that it looked in places like
the framework of a monstrous serpent. The endless road gleamed in the
sun as if it were paved with ivory. For thousands of years this had been
the highway over the desert, and during all that time no animal of all
those countless caravans had died there without being preserved by the
dry, antiseptic air. No wonder, then, that it was hardly possible to
walk down it now without treading upon their skeletons.
