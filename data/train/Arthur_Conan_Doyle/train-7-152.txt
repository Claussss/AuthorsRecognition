Of all the bitter day, it was the very bitterest moment. Happy Mr.
Stuart lay upon the pebbles with his back against the ribs of his
camel, and chuckled consumedly at some joke which those busy little
cell-workers had come across in their repairs. His fat face was wreathed and creased with merriment. But the others,
how sick, how heart-sick, were they all! The women cried. The men turned
away in that silence which is beyond tears. Monsieur Fardet fell upon
his face, and shook with dry sobbings.
