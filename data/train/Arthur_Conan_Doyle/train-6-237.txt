On the left of the King, and so near to him that great intimacy
was implied, rode a man about his own age, with the broad face, the
projecting jaw and the flattish nose which are often the outward
indications of a pugnacious nature. His complexion was crimson, his large blue eyes somewhat prominent,
and his whole appearance full-blooded and choleric. He was short, but
massively built, and evidently possessed of immense strength. His voice,
however, when he spoke was gentle and lisping, while his manner was
quiet and courteous. Unlike the King or the Prince, he was clad in light
armor and carried a sword by his side and a mace at his saddle-bow, for
he was acting as Captain of the King's Guard, and a dozen other knights
in steel followed in the escort. No hardier soldier could Edward have
at his side, if, as was always possible in those lawless times, sudden
danger was to threaten, for this was the famous knight of Hainault,
now naturalized as an Englishman, Sir Walter Manny, who bore as high
a reputation for chivalrous valor and for gallant temerity as Chandos
himself.
