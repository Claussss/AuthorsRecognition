‘But how depart?’ I asked. ‘Through here,’ he answered, pushing open the casement, and sliding the
rope along the beam in that direction. ‘The rope may be a foot or two
short, but you have extra inches to make matters even. When you have
reached the ground, take the gravel path which turns to the right, and
follow it until it leads you to the high trees which skirt the park. The
seventh of these hath a bough which shoots over the boundary wall. Climb
along the bough, drop over upon the other side, and you will find my
own valet waiting with your horse. Up with you, and ride, haste, haste,
post-haste, for the south. By morn you should be well out of danger’s
way.’
