“If that be sign of sin, then, by Saint Paul! I have much upon my soul,”
 said Sir Nigel, amid a general laugh. “But in very truth, Sir Tristram,
if I may venture a word of counsel, I should advise that you make your
peace with this good man.” “He shall have four silver candlesticks,” said the seneschal moodily.
“And yet I would that he would leave the folk alone. You cannot conceive
in your mind how stubborn and brainless they are. Mules and pigs are
full of reason beside them. God He knows that I have had great patience
with them. It was but last week that, having to raise some money,
I called up to the castle Jean Goubert, who, as all men know, has a
casketful of gold pieces hidden away in some hollow tree. I give you my
word that I did not so much as lay a stripe upon his fool's back, but
after speaking with him, and telling him how needful the money was to
me, I left him for the night to think over the matter in my dungeon.
What think you that the dog did? Why, in the morning we found that he
had made a rope from strips of his leathern jerkin, and had hung himself
to the bar of the window.”
