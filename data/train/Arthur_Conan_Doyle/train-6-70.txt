He turned with a rush, and one magnificent deer-like bound carried him
over the four-foot gate. Nigel's hat had flown off, and his yellow curls
streamed behind him as he rose and fell in the leap. They were in the
water-meadow now, and the rippling stream twenty feet wide gleamed in
front of them running down to the main current of the Wey. The yellow
horse gathered his haunches under him and flew over like an arrow. He
took off from behind a boulder and cleared a furze-bush on the farther
side. Two stones still mark the leap from hoof-mark to hoof-mark, and
they are eleven good paces apart. Under the hanging branch of the great
oak-tree on the farther side (that Quercus Tilfordiensis ordiensis is
still shown as the bound of the Abby's immediate precincts) the great
horse passed. He had hoped to sweep off his rider, but Nigel sank low
on the heaving back with his face buried in the flying mane. The rough
bough rasped him rudely, but never shook his spirit nor his grip.
Rearing, plunging and struggling, Pommers broke through the sapling
grove and was out on the broad stretch of Hankley Down.
