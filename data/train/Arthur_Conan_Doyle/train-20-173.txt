      The study proved to be a small chamber, lined on three sides with
      books, and with a writing-table facing an ordinary window, which
      looked out upon the garden. Our first attention was given to the
      body of the unfortunate squire, whose huge frame lay stretched
      across the room. His disordered dress showed that he had been
      hastily aroused from sleep. The bullet had been fired at him from
      the front, and had remained in his body, after penetrating the
      heart. His death had certainly been instantaneous and painless.
      There was no powder-marking either upon his dressing-gown or on
      his hands. According to the country surgeon, the lady had stains
      upon her face, but none upon her hand.
