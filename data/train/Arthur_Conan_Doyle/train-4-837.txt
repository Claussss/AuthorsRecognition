‘Is that your opinion, too, Colonel Saxon?’ the King asked. ‘Assuredly, your Majesty, if we can fight to advantage. We can scarce
do that, however, by crossing the river on a single narrow bridge in
the face of such a force. I should advise that we destroy this Keynsham
Bridge, and march down this southern bank in the hope of forcing a fight
in a position which we may choose.’ ‘We have not yet summoned Bath,’ said Wade. ‘Let us do as Colonel Saxon
proposes, and let us in the meantime march in that direction and send a
trumpet to the governor.’
