      It was after tea on a summer evening, and the conversation, which
      had roamed in a desultory, spasmodic fashion from golf clubs to
      the causes of the change in the obliquity of the ecliptic, came
      round at last to the question of atavism and hereditary
      aptitudes. The point under discussion was, how far any singular
      gift in an individual was due to his ancestry and how far to his
      own early training.
