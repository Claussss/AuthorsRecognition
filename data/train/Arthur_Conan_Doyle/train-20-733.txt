      These few inquiries proved, however, to be a more lengthy
      proceeding than Holmes had imagined, for he did not return to the
      inn until nearly nine o’clock. He was pale and dejected, stained
      with dust, and exhausted with hunger and fatigue. A cold supper
      was ready upon the table, and when his needs were satisfied and
      his pipe alight he was ready to take that half comic and wholly
      philosophic view which was natural to him when his affairs were
      going awry. The sound of carriage wheels caused him to rise and
      glance out of the window. A brougham and pair of greys, under the
      glare of a gas-lamp, stood before the doctor’s door.
