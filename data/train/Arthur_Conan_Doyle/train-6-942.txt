Through these scattered knots of horsemen Chandos rode, and as many of
them were old antagonists it was “Ha, John!” on the one side, and “Ha,
Raoul!” “Ha, Nicholas!” “Ha, Guichard!” upon the other, as they brushed
past them. Only one cavalier greeted them amiss, a large, red-faced man,
the Lord Clermont, who by some strange chance bore upon his surcoat a
blue virgin standing amid golden sunbeams, which was the very device
which Chandos had donned for the day. The fiery Frenchman dashed across
their path and drew his steed back on to its haunches.
