  upright beside him--an old veteran with thick bushy, grizzly
  beard, countenance like a lion--a lancer of the old guard,

  flourished in the air as he spoke, the other, severed at the
  wrist, lay on the earth beside him; one ball (case-shot,
  probably) had entered his body, another had broken his leg.

  have been great; yet he betrayed it not. His bearing was
  that of a Roman, or perhaps an Indian warrior, and I could
  fancy him concluding appropriately his speech in the words
  of the Mexican king, 'And I too; am I on a bed of roses?'"
