     "Sir Conan Doyle, quoted in the _International Psychic Gazette_, in
     referring to his 'ups and downs' in Australia, says: 'Amid the
     "downs" is the Press boycott, caused partly by ignorance and want
     of proportion, partly by moral cowardice and fear of finding out
     later that they had backed the wrong horse, or had given the wrong
     horse fair play. They are very backward, and far behind countries
     like Iceland and Denmark in the knowledge of what has been done in
     Spiritualism. They are dear folk, these Australians, but, Lord,
     they want Spirituality, and dynamiting out of their grooves! The
     Presbyterians actually prayed that I might not reach the country.
     This is rather near murder, if they thought their rotten prayers
     would avail. The result was an excellent voyage, but it is the
     spiritual deadness of this place which gets on my nerves.'"
