      Stapleton had abandoned the chase and came back to us breathing
      hard and flushed with his exertions.       “Halloa, Beryl!” said he, and it seemed to me that the tone of
      his greeting was not altogether a cordial one.       “Well, Jack, you are very hot.”       “Yes, I was chasing a Cyclopides. He is very rare and seldom
      found in the late autumn. What a pity that I should have missed
      him!” He spoke unconcernedly, but his small light eyes glanced
      incessantly from the girl to me.
