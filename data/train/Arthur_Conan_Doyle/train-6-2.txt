The matter of diction is always a question of taste and discretion in a
historical reproduction. In the year 1350 the upper classes still spoke
Norman-French, though they were just beginning to condescend to English.
The lower classes spoke the English of the original Piers Plowman text,
which would be considerably more obscure than their superiors' French if
the two were now reproduced or imitated. The most which the chronicles
can do is to catch the cadence and style of their talk, and to infuse
here and there such a dash of the archaic as may indicate their fashion
of speech.
