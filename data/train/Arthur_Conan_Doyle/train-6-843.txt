It was nightfall when the little army entered the outer gate of the
Castle of Ploermel and encamped in the broad Bailey yard. Ploermel was
at that time the center of British power in Mid-Brittany, as Hennebon
was in the West, and it was held by a garrison of five hundred men under
an old soldier, Richard of Bambro', a rugged Northumbrian, trained in
that great school of warriors, the border wars. He who had ridden the
marches of the most troubled frontier in Europe, and served his time
against the Liddlesdale and Nithsdale raiders was hardened for a life in
the field.
