“Truly, Nigel, you have come at a very good time for advancement. I
cannot see how we can leave this spot without a great battle which will
live in men's minds forever. In all our fights in France I cannot call
to mind any in which they have been so strong or we so weak as now, so
that there will be the more honor to be gained. I would that we had
two thousand more archers. But I doubt not that we shall give them much
trouble ere they drive us out from amidst these hedges. Have you seen
the French?”
