      Lestrade, whose eyebrows had gone up once or twice during this
      remarkable explanation.       “Not until I have been to Blackheath.”       “You mean to Norwood,” said Lestrade.       “Oh, yes, no doubt that is what I must have meant,” said Holmes,
      with his enigmatical smile. Lestrade had learned by more
      experiences than he would care to acknowledge that that brain
      could cut through that which was impenetrable to him. I saw him
      look curiously at my companion.
