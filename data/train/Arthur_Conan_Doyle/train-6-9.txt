Oppressive laws slackened for want of those who could enforce them, and
once slackened could never be enforced again. The laborer would be a
slave no longer. The bondsman snapped his shackles. There was much to do
and few left to do it. Therefore the few should be freemen, name their
own price, and work where and for whom they would. It was the black
death which cleared the way for that great rising thirty years later
which left the English peasant the freest of his class in Europe.
