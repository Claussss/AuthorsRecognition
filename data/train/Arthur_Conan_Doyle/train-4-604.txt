strong effort. ‘Do you, as a soldier, agree with my Lord Grey?’ ‘Ask Saxon, your Majesty,’ the German answered. ‘My opinion in a
Raths-Versammlung is, I have observed, ever the same as his.’ ‘Then we turn to you, Colonel Saxon,’ said Monmouth. ‘We have in this
council a party who are in favour of an advance and a party who wish
to stand their ground. Their weight and numbers are, methinks, nearly
equal. If you had the casting vote how would you decide?’ All eyes were
bent upon our leader, for his martial bearing, and the respect shown to
him by the veteran Buyse, made it likely that his opinion might really
turn the scale. He sat for a few moments in silence with his hands
before his face.
