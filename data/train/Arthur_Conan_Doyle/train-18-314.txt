They were so still and silent that they might have been two bronze
statues but for the slow and measured rhythm of their breathing. Their
faces, however, had a peculiar, ashen-grey colour, very different from
the healthy brown of my companion's, and I observed, on stooping my
head, that only the whites of their eyes were visible, the balls being
turned upwards beneath the lids. In front of them upon a small mat lay an earthenware pitcher of water
and half-a-loaf of bread, together with a sheet of paper inscribed with
certain cabalistic characters. Ram Singh glanced at these, and then,
motioning to me to withdraw, followed me out into the garden.
