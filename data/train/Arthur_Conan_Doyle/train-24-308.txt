“It is well to have a learned clerk in every troop,” said Sir Nigel. “By
St. Paul, there are men so caitiff that they think more of a scrivener's
pen than of their lady's smile, and do their devoir in hopes that they
may fill a line in a chronicle or make a tag to a jongleur's romance. I
remember well that, at the siege of Retters, there was a little, sleek,
fat clerk of the name of Chaucer, who was so apt at rondel, sirvente, or
tonson, that no man dare give back a foot from the walls, lest he find
it all set down in his rhymes and sung by every underling and varlet
in the camp. But, my soul's bird, you hear me prate as though all were
decided, when I have not yet taken counsel either with you or with my
lady mother. Let us to the chamber, while these strangers find such fare
as pantry and cellar may furnish.”
