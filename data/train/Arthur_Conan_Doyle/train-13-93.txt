      Finding that Holmes was too absorbed for conversation I had
      tossed aside the barren paper, and leaning back in my chair I
      fell into a brown study. Suddenly my companion’s voice broke in
      upon my thoughts:       “You are right, Watson,” said he. “It does seem a most
      preposterous way of settling a dispute.”       “Most preposterous!” I exclaimed, and then suddenly realizing how
      he had echoed the inmost thought of my soul, I sat up in my chair
      and stared at him in blank amazement.
