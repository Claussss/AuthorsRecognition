"Well, the man was about half over when he fell into one of those
convulsive flurries which come with the semi-unconscious stage. He
kicked and plunged and struck out with both hands. Over with a crash
went the little table which held the candles, and in an instant we were
left in total darkness. You can think what a rush and a scurry there
was, one to pick up the table, one to find the matches, and some to
restrain the patient, who was still dashing himself about. He was held
down by two dressers, the chloroform was pushed, and by the time the
candles were relit, his incoherent, half-smothered shoutings had changed
to a stertorous snore. His head was turned on the pillow and the towel
was still kept over his face while the operation was carried through.
Then the towel was withdrawn, and you can conceive our amazement when we
looked upon the face of M'Namara.
