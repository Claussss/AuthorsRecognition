VII. HOW NIGEL WENT MARKETING TO GUILDFORD 
It was on a bright June morning that young Nigel, with youth and
springtime to make his heart light, rode upon his errand from Tilford
to Guildford town. Beneath him was his great yellow warhorse, caracoling
and curveting as he went, as blithe and free of spirit as his master.
In all England one would scarce have found upon that morning so
high-mettled and so debonair a pair. The sandy road wound through groves
of fir, where the breeze came soft and fragrant with resinous gums, or
over heathery downs, which rolled away to north and to south, vast and
untenanted, for on the uplands the soil was poor and water scarce.
Over Crooksbury Common he passed, and then across the great Heath of
Puttenham, following a sandy path which wound amid the bracken and
the heather, for he meant to strike the Pilgrims' Way where it turned
eastward from Farnham and from Seale. As he rode he continually felt his
saddle-bag with his hand, for in it, securely strapped, he had placed
the precious treasures of the Lady Ermyntrude. As he saw the grand tawny
neck tossing before him, and felt the easy heave of the great horse and
heard the muffled drumming of his hoofs, he could have sung and shouted
with the joy of living.
