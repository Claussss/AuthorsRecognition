      Holmes sprang from his chair.       “Get behind him, Watson! Don’t let him out! Now, sir, let us see
      the contents of that notebook.”       Milverton had glided as quick as a rat to the side of the room
      and stood with his back against the wall.       “Mr. Holmes, Mr. Holmes,” he said, turning the front of his coat
      and exhibiting the butt of a large revolver, which projected from
      the inside pocket. “I have been expecting you to do something
      original. This has been done so often, and what good has ever
      come from it? I assure you that I am armed to the teeth, and I am
      perfectly prepared to use my weapons, knowing that the law will
      support me. Besides, your supposition that I would bring the
      letters here in a notebook is entirely mistaken. I would do
      nothing so foolish. And now, gentlemen, I have one or two little
      interviews this evening, and it is a long drive to Hampstead.” He
      stepped forward, took up his coat, laid his hand on his revolver,
      and turned to the door. I picked up a chair, but Holmes shook his
      head, and I laid it down again. With bow, a smile, and a twinkle,
      Milverton was out of the room, and a few moments after we heard
      the slam of the carriage door and the rattle of the wheels as he
      drove away.
