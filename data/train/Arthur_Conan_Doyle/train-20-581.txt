      Mr. Soames was somewhat overwhelmed by this flood of information.
      “I can follow the other points,” said he, “but really, in this
      matter of the length——”       Holmes held out a small chip with the letters NN and a space of
      clear wood after them.       “You see?”       “No, I fear that even now——”       “Watson, I have always done you an injustice. There are others.
      What could this NN be? It is at the end of a word. You are aware
      that Johann Faber is the most common maker’s name. Is it not
      clear that there is just as much of the pencil left as usually
      follows the Johann?” He held the small table sideways to the
      electric light. “I was hoping that if the paper on which he wrote
      was thin, some trace of it might come through upon this polished
      surface. No, I see nothing. I don’t think there is anything more
      to be learned here. Now for the central table. This small pellet
      is, I presume, the black, doughy mass you spoke of. Roughly
      pyramidal in shape and hollowed out, I perceive. As you say,
      there appear to be grains of sawdust in it. Dear me, this is very
      interesting. And the cut—a positive tear, I see. It began with a
      thin scratch and ended in a jagged hole. I am much indebted to
      you for directing my attention to this case, Mr. Soames. Where
      does that door lead to?”
