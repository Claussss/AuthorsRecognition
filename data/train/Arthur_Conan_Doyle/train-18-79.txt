Gabriel sits beside me now as I write, and she agrees with me that, dear
as is the subject to ourselves, the whole story of our mutual affection
is of too personal a nature to be more than touched upon in this
statement. Suffice it to say that, within a few weeks of our first
meeting Mordaunt Heatherstone had won the heart of my dear sister, and
Gabriel had given me that pledge which death itself will not be able to
break.
