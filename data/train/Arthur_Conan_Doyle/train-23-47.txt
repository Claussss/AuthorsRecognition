As to the method by which they attain their results they have, when in
the trance state, no recollection.  In the case of normal clairvoyants
and clairaudients, the information comes in different ways.  Sometimes
it is no more than a strong mental impression which gives a name or an
address.  Sometimes they say that they see it written up before them.
Sometimes the spirit figures seem to call it to them.  "They yell it at
me," said one.
