I have Stevenson's collected poems over yonder in the small cabinet.
Would that he had given us more! Most of them are the merest playful
sallies of a freakish mind. But one should, indeed, be a classic,
for it is in my judgment by all odds the best narrative ballad of
the last century--that is if I am right in supposing that "The
Ancient Mariner" appeared at the very end of the eighteenth. I
would put Coleridge's tour de force of grim fancy first, but I know
none other to compare in glamour and phrase and easy power with
"Ticonderoga." Then there is his immortal epitaph. The two pieces
alone give him a niche of his own in our poetical literature, just
as his character gives him a niche of his own in our affections. No,
I never met him. But among my most prized possessions are several
letters which I received from Samoa. From that distant tower he kept
a surprisingly close watch upon what was doing among the bookmen,
and it was his hand which was among the first held out to the
striver, for he had quick appreciation and keen sympathies which
met another man's work half-way, and wove into it a beauty from his
own mind.
