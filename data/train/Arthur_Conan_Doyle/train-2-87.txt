It is a matter of history, however, that a little time was still to
elapse before the Tiger of San Pedro should meet with his deserts. Wily
and bold, he and his companion threw their pursuer off their track by
entering a lodging-house in Edmonton Street and leaving by the
back-gate into Curzon Square. From that day they were seen no more in
England. Some six months afterwards the Marquess of Montalva and Signor
Rulli, his secretary, were both murdered in their rooms at the Hotel
Escurial at Madrid. The crime was ascribed to Nihilism, and the
murderers were never arrested. Inspector Baynes visited us at Baker
Street with a printed description of the dark face of the secretary,
and of the masterful features, the magnetic black eyes, and the tufted
brows of his master. We could not doubt that justice, if belated, had
come at last.
