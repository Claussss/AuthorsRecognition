      “But now came the real difficulty of the inquiry. The order of
      the English letters after E is by no means well marked, and any
      preponderance which may be shown in an average of a printed sheet
      may be reversed in a single short sentence. Speaking roughly, T,
      A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, and L are the numerical order in which
      letters occur, but T, A, O, and I are very nearly abreast of each
      other, and it would be an endless task to try each combination
      until a meaning was arrived at. I therefore waited for fresh
      material. In my second interview with Mr. Hilton Cubitt he was
      able to give me two other short sentences and one message, which
      appeared—since there was no flag—to be a single word. Here are
      the symbols. Now, in the single word I have already got the two
      E’s coming second and fourth in a word of five letters. It might
      be ‘sever,’ or ‘lever,’ or ‘never.’ There can be no question that
      the latter as a reply to an appeal is far the most probable, and
      the circumstances pointed to its being a reply written by the
      lady. Accepting it as correct, we are now able to say that the
      symbols stand respectively for N, V, and R.
