The armorer looked at Nigel's small upright figure and burst out
laughing. “You jest, Squire Loring! The suit was made for one who was
far above the common stature of man.” “Nay, I jest not. If it will but carry me through one spear-running it
will have served its purpose.” The armorer leaned back on his anvil and pondered while Nigel stared
anxiously at his sooty face. “Right gladly would I lend you a suit of plate for this one venture,
Squire Loring, but I know well that if you should be overthrown your
harness becomes prize to the victor. I am a poor man with many children,
and I dare not risk the loss of it. But as to what you say of the old
suit of mail, is it indeed in good condition?”
