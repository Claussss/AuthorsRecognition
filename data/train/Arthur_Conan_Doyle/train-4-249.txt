The first result of my appeal was a sound as of some one bustling
rapidly about, with the clinking of metal and noise of the turning of
locks. This died away into a hush, and I was about to knock once more
when a crackling voice greeted us from the other side of the door. ‘There is little shelter here, gentlemen, and less provisions,’ it said.
‘It is but six miles to Amesbury, where at the Cecil Arms ye shall find,
I doubt not, all that is needful for man and for beast.’
