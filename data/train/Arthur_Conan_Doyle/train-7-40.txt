Foreign Relations.” “The world is small, and it grows smaller every day. It's a single
organic body, and one spot of gangrene is enough to vitiate the
whole. There's no room upon it for dishonest, defaulting, tyrannical,
irresponsible Governments. As long as they exist they will always be
centres of trouble and of danger. But there are many races which appear
to be so incapable of improvement that we can never hope to get a good
Government out of them. What is to be done, then? The former device of
Providence in such a case was extermination by some more virile stock.
An Attila or a Tamerlane pruned off the weaker branch. Now, we have a
more merciful substitution of rulers, or even of mere advice from a more
advanced race. That is the case with the Central Asian Khanates and with
the protected States of India. If the work has to be done, and if we are
the best fitted for the work, then I think that it would be a cowardice
and a crime to shirk it.”
