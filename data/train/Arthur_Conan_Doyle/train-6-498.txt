“By Saint Leonard! archer,” said Cock Badding, “had I more time I
would give you a lesson ere I leave land. Stand back and give place to
others!” “Nay, stand back and give place to me!” cried Aylward, and seizing
Badding round the waist he slung him into the dock. There was a cry of anger from the crowd, for Badding was the hero of all
the Cinque Ports and had never yet met his match in manhood. The epitaph
still lingers in which it was said that he “could never rest until
he had foughten his fill.” When, therefore, swimming like a duck, he
reached a rope and pulled himself hand over hand up to the quay, all
stood aghast to see what fell fate would befall this bold stranger. But
Badding laughed loudly, dashing the saltwater from his eyes and hair.
