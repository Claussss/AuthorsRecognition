eyes, and then, dropping his two ladies, who were instantly carried off

down to him. “Now, by my hilt, Squire Nigel, this is the fairest sight
of my lifetime!” he cried. “And you, old leather-face! Nay, Simon, I
would put my arms round your dried herring of a body, if I could but
reach you. Here is Pommers too, and I read in his eye that he knows me
well and is as ready to put his teeth into me as when he stood in my
father's stall.”
