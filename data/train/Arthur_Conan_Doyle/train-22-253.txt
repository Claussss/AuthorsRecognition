“Well, I don't know it; but Vermissa is out of my beat. I live at
Hobson's Patch, and that's here where we are drawing up. But, say,
there's one bit of advice I'll give you before we part: If you're
in trouble in Vermissa, go straight to the Union House and see Boss
McGinty. He is the Bodymaster of Vermissa Lodge, and nothing can happen
in these parts unless Black Jack McGinty wants it. So long, mate! Maybe
we'll meet in lodge one of these evenings. But mind my words: If you are
in trouble, go to Boss McGinty.”
