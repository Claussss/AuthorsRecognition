And yet in reading his letters and dispatches, one is surprised
sometimes at the incisive thought and its vigorous expression. There
is a passage in which he describes the way in which his soldiers
would occasionally desert into some town which he was besieging.
"They knew," he writes, "that they must be taken, for when we lay
our bloody hands upon a place we are sure to take it, sooner or
later; but they liked being dry and under cover, and then that
extraordinary caprice which always pervades the English character!
Our deserters are very badly treated by the enemy; those who
deserted in France were treated as the lowest of mortals, slaves and
scavengers. Nothing but English caprice can account for it; just
what makes our noblemen associate with stage-coach drivers, and
become stage-coach drivers themselves." After reading that passage,
how often does the phrase "the extraordinary caprice which always
pervades the English character" come back as one observes some fresh
manifestation of it!
