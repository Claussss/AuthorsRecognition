Some were taken off to this cottage and some to that, but the greater
part came back to Branksome with us, where we gave them such dry clothes
as we could lay our hands on, and served them with beef and beer by the
kitchen fire. The captain, whose name was Meadows, compressed his bulky
form into a suit of my own, and came down to the parlour, where he
mixed himself some grog and gave my father and myself an account of the
disaster.
