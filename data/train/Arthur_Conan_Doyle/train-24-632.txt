A stern, clear bugle call had sounded close at hand to summon some
following together for the night. “It is a sign to us as well,” said Ford. “I would fain stay here forever
amid all these beautiful things--” staring hard at the blushing Tita as
he spoke--“but we must be back at our lord's hostel ere he reach it.”
 Amid renewed thanks and with promises to come again, the two squires
bade their leave of the old Italian glass-stainer and his daughter. The
streets were clearer now, and the rain had stopped, so they made their
way quickly from the Rue du Roi, in which their new friends dwelt, to
the Rue des Apotres, where the hostel of the “Half Moon” was situated.
