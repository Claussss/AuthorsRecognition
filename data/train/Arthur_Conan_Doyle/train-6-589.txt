Whilst wine, fruit and spices were handed round the high tables
the squires had been served in turn at the farther end of the hall.
Meanwhile round the King there had gathered a group of statesmen and
soldiers, talking eagerly among themselves. The Earl of Stafford, the
Earl of Warwick, the Earl of Arundel, Lord Beauchamp and Lord Neville
were assembled at the back of his chair, with Lord Percy and Lord
Mowbray at either side. The little group blazed with golden chains and
jeweled chaplets, flame colored paltocks and purple tunics.
