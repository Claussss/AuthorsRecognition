      “That is more probable.”       “Then the brother—for that, I fancy, must be the
      relationship—comes over from Greece to interfere. He imprudently
      puts himself into the power of the young man and his older
      associate. They seize him and use violence towards him in order
      to make him sign some papers to make over the girl’s fortune—of
      which he may be trustee—to them. This he refuses to do. In order
      to negotiate with him they have to get an interpreter, and they
      pitch upon this Mr. Melas, having used some other one before. The
      girl is not told of the arrival of her brother, and finds it out
      by the merest accident.”
