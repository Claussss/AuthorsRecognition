‘It is true,’ he answered; ‘but such messages come in to me from every
soldier who wishes to sell his sword, and every inventor who hath a long
tongue and a short purse. How could I tell that the matter was of real
import?’ ‘I feared to let the chance slip lest it might never return,’ said I. ‘I

this privacy I can tell my real thoughts without fear of betrayal or
misconstruction. On paper I will not write one word. Your memory must

from it all that you have heard me say in the council-room. Let it be as
though it never were spoken. Is that done?’
