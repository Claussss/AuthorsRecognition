“I have had ample proof of your immense wealth,” said Robert. “And you are very naturally curious as to how that wealth was obtained.
Well, I can tell you one thing. The money is perfectly clean. I have
robbed no one, cheated no one, sweated no one, ground no one down in the
gaining of it. I can read your father's eye, Robert. I can see that he
has done me an injustice in this matter. Well, perhaps he is not to be
blamed. Perhaps I also might think uncharitable things if I were In his
place. But that is why I now give an explanation to you, Robert, and not
to him. You, at least, have trusted me, and you have a right, before I
become one of your family, to know all that I can tell you. Laura also
has trusted me, but I know well that she is content still to trust me.”
