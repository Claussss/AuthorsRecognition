How nobly they lived makes the body of the book, how serenely they
died forms the end to it. It is a tale which cannot even now be read
without a shudder--a nightmare of horrors. Fanaticism may brace a
man to hurl himself into oblivion, as the Mahdi's hordes did before
Khartoum, but one feels that it is at least a higher development of
such emotion, where men slowly and in cold blood endure so thankless
a life, and welcome so dreadful an end. Every faith can equally
boast its martyrs--a painful thought, since it shows how many
thousands must have given their blood for error--but in testifying
to their faith these brave men have testified to something more
important still, to the subjugation of the body and to the absolute
supremacy of the dominating spirit.
