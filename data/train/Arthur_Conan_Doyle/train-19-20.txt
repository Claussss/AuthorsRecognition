"Pray forgive me," said she, "if I take means to overcome your
scepticism.  Open this note at ten o'clock to-morrow morning.  It is a
little private test." I can't imagine what she means, but there is the note, and it shall be
opened as she directs.  My head is aching, and I have written enough
for to-night.  To-morrow I dare say that what seems so inexplicable
will take quite another complexion.  I shall not surrender my
convictions without a struggle.
