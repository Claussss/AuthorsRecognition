The sacrist had finished his exposition, and the sergeant-at-law was
about to conclude a case which Nigel could in no way controvert, when
help came to him from an unexpected quarter. It may have been a certain
malignity with which the sacrist urged his suit, it may have been a
diplomatic dislike to driving matters to extremes, or it may have been
some genuine impulse of kindliness, for Abbot John was choleric but
easily appeased. Whatever the cause, the result was that a white plump
hand, raised in the air with a gesture of authority, showed that the
case was at an end.
