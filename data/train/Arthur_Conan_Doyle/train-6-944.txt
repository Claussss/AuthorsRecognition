But the Frenchman was choleric and hard to appease. “You English can
invent nothing,” said he, “and you take for your own whatever you see
handsome belonging to others.” So, grumbling and fuming, he rode upon
his way, while Chandos, laughing gayly, spurred onward across the plain. The immediate front of the English line was shrouded with scattered
trees and bushes which hid the enemy; but when they had cleared these a
fair view of the great French army lay before them. In the center of
the huge camp was a long and high pavilion of red silk, with the silver
lilies of the King at one end of it, and the golden oriflamme, the
battle-flag of old France, at the other. Like the reeds of a pool from
side to side of the broad array, and dwindling away as far as their
eyes could see, were the banners and pennons of high barons and famous
knights, but above them all flew the ducal standards which showed that
the feudal muster of all the warlike provinces of France was in the
field before them.
