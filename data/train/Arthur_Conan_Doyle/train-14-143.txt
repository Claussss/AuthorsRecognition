      Just before dinner two telegrams were handed in. The first ran:       Have just heard that Barrymore is at the Hall. BASKERVILLE.       The second:       Visited twenty-three hotels as directed, but sorry to report
      unable to trace cut sheet of _Times_. CARTWRIGHT.       “There go two of my threads, Watson. There is nothing more
      stimulating than a case where everything goes against you. We
      must cast round for another scent.”
