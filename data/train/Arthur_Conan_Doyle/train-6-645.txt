The bowmen along either side of the Philippa had stood motionless
waiting for their orders, but now there was a sharp shout from their
leader, and every string twanged together. The air was full of their
harping, together with the swish of the arrows, the long-drawn keening
of the bowmen and the short deep bark of the under-officers. “Steady,
steady! Loose steady! Shoot wholly together! Twelve score paces! Ten
score! Now eight! Shoot wholly together!” Their gruff shouts broke
through the high shrill cry like the deep roar of a wave through the
howl of the wind.
