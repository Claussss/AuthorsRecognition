Near Sevenoaks their road turned out of the old Canterbury way and
pointed south toward the coast, leaving the chalk lands and coming down
into the clay of the Weald. It was a wretched, rutted mule-track running
through thick forests with occasional clearings in which lay the small
Kentish villages, where rude shock-headed peasants with smocks and
galligaskins stared with bold, greedy eyes at the travelers. Once on the
right they caught a distant view of the Towers of Penshurst, and once
they heard the deep tolling of the bells of Bayham Abbey, but for the
rest of their day's journey savage peasants and squalid cottages were
all that met their eyes, with endless droves of pigs who fed upon the
litter of acorns. The throng of travelers who crowded the old road
were all gone, and only here and there did they meet or overtake some
occasional merchant or messenger bound for Battle Abbey, Pevensey Castle
or the towns of the south.
