By the way, talking of history, have you read Parkman's works? He
was, I think, among the very greatest of the historians, and yet
one seldom hears his name. A New England man by birth, and writing
principally of the early history of the American Settlements and of
French Canada, it is perhaps excusable that he should have no great
vogue in England, but even among Americans I have found many who
have not read him. There are four of his volumes in green and gold
down yonder, "The Jesuits in Canada," and "Frontenac," but there
are others, all of them well worth reading, "Pioneers of France,"
"Montcalm and Wolfe," "Discovery of the Great West," etc. Some day
I hope to have a complete set.
