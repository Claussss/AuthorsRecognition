“You will appreciate the difficulty of the situation, Watson. There is
nothing upon which we can apply for a warrant. Our whole scheme might
seem fantastic if laid before a magistrate. The woman’s disappearance
counts for nothing, since in that extraordinary household any member of
it might be invisible for a week. And yet she may at the present moment
be in danger of her life. All I can do is to watch the house and leave
my agent, Warner, on guard at the gates. We can’t let such a situation
continue. If the law can do nothing we must take the risk ourselves.”
