Nigel had received word from Chandos to join him at “The Sign of the
Broom-Pod” in Winchelsea. Three days beforehand he and Aylward rode from
Tilford all armed and ready for the wars. Nigel was in hunting-costume,
blithe and gay, with his precious armor and his small baggage trussed
upon the back of a spare horse which Aylward led by the bridle. The
archer had himself a good black mare, heavy and slow, but strong enough
to be fit to carry his powerful frame. In his brigandine of chain mail
and his steel cap, with straight strong sword by his side, his yellow
long-bow jutting over his shoulder, and his quiver of arrows supported
by a scarlet baldric, he was such a warrior as any knight might well
be proud to have in his train. All Tilford trailed behind them, as they
rode slowly over the long slope of heath land which skirts the flank of
Crooksbury Hill.
