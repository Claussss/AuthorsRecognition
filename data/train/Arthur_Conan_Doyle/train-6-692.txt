At the farther end of the table a woman was standing. An open door
behind her showed that she had come from the inner room of the house.
By her tall figure the comrades knew that she was the same that they had
already seen. Her face had once been fair, but now was white and haggard
with wild dark eyes full of a hopeless terror and despair. Slowly she
paced up the room, her gaze fixed not upon the comrades, but upon the
dreadful thing beneath the table. Then as she stooped and was sure she
burst into loud laughter and clapped her hands.
