“You have now an opportunity,” he said, in a subdued, reverential voice,
“of seeing a spectacle which few Europeans have had the privilege of
beholding. Inside that cottage you will find two Yogis--men who are only
one remove from the highest plane of adeptship. They are both wrapped
in an ecstatic trance, otherwise I should not venture to obtrude your
presence upon them. Their astral bodies have departed from them, to be
present at the feast of lamps in the holy Lamasery of Rudok in Tibet.
Tread lightly lest by stimulating their corporeal functions you recall
them before their devotions are completed.”
