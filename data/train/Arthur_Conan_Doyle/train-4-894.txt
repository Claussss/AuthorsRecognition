‘But how did you chance upon the spot at the very nick of time?’ I
asked. ‘Why, marry, I was jogging down the road on my mare when I heard the
clatter of hoofs behind me, and concealing myself in a field, as a
prudent man would while the country is in its present state, I saw these
four rogues gallop past. They made their way up to the farmhouse
here, and presently from cries and other tokens I knew what manner of
hell-fire business they had on hand. On that I left my mare in the field
and ran up, when I saw them through the casement, tricing the good man
up in front of his fire to make him confess where his wealth lay hidden,
though indeed it is my own belief that neither he nor any other farmer
in these parts hath any wealth left to hide, after two armies have been
quartered in turn upon them. Finding that his mouth remained closed,
they ran him up, as you saw, and would assuredly have toasted him like a
snipe, had I not stepped in and winged two of them with my barkers. The
others set upon me, but I pinked one through the forearm, and should
doubtless have given a good account of both of them but for your
incoming.’
