My first thought was that the fellow was some Ghazi or Afghan fanatic
who had stolen in with the intention of stabbing me, and with this idea
in my mind I had all the will to spring from my couch and defend myself,
but the power was unaccountably lacking. An overpowering languor and want of energy possessed me. Had I seen
the dagger descending upon my breast I could not have made an effort
to avert it. I suppose a bird when it is under the influence of a snake
feels very much as I did in the presence of this gloomy-faced stranger.
My mind was clear enough, but my body was as torpid as though I were
still asleep.
