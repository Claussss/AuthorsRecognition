stands at bay with brave pose and heart of fire, but who sees himself
compassed round and knows clearly that there is no escape. With his bold
young face, his steady blue eyes, and the proud poise of his head, he

high oriel window, and showing up the stained and threadbare condition
of his once rich doublet, seemed to illuminate the fallen fortunes of
his family.
