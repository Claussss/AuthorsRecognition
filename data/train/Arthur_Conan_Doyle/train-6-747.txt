But even as they watched, the trumpet-call burst forth once more. It
came not from the castle but from the farther end of the valley. It was
answered by a second call from the walls. Then in a long, straggling
line there came a wild troop of marauders streaming homeward from some
foray. In the van, at the head of a body of spearmen, rode a tall and
burly man, clad in brazen armor, so that he shone like a golden image
in the slanting rays of the sun. His helmet had been loosened from his
gorget and was held before him on his horse's neck. A great tangled
beard flowed over his breastplate, and his hair hung down as far behind.
A squire at his elbow bore high the banner of the bleeding head. Behind
the spearmen were a line of heavily laden mules, and on either side
of them a drove of poor country folk, who were being herded into the
castle. Lastly came a second strong troop of mounted spearmen, who
conducted a score or more of prisoners who marched together in a solid
body.
