But there was no sadness in the young heart of Nigel, as he rode by the
side of Knolles at the head of a clump of spears, nor did it seem to him
that Fate had led him into an unduly arduous path. On the contrary,
he blessed the good fortune which had sent him into so delightful a
country, and it seemed to him as he listened to dreadful stories of
robber barons, and looked round at the black scars of war which lay
branded upon the fair faces of the hills, that no hero of romances or
trouveur had ever journeyed through such a land of promise, with so fair
a chance of knightly venture and honorable advancement.
