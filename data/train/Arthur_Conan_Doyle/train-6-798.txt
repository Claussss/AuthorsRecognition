“Then if we should take the small fort we may pass down this tunnel, and
so carry the great castle also.” “Such a thing might happen,” said Simon, “and yet it is dangerous also,
for surely those in the castle would hear our assault upon the fort and
so be warned to bar the passage against us, and to slay the prisoners
before we could come.” “What then is your rede?” “Could we find where the tunnel lay, Squire Nigel, I know not what is to
prevent us from digging down upon it and breaking into it so that both
fort and castle are at our mercy before either knows that we are there.”
