The Hampshire knight was not a man to be disheartened by a reverse. He
spurred back to the pavilion, and was out in a few instants with another
helmet. The second course was so equal that the keenest judges could not
discern any vantage. Each struck fire from the other's shield, and each
endured the jarring shock as though welded to the horse beneath him. In
the final bout, however, Sir Nigel struck his opponent with so true an
aim that the point of the lance caught between the bars of his vizor and
tore the front of his helmet out, while the German, aiming somewhat
low, and half stunned by the shock, had the misfortune to strike his
adversary upon the thigh, a breach of the rules of the tilting-yard, by
which he not only sacrificed his chances of success, but would also
have forfeited his horse and his armor, had the English knight chosen
to claim them. A roar of applause from the English soldiers, with an
ominous silence from the vast crowd who pressed round the barriers,
announced that the balance of victory lay with the holders. Already the
ten champions had assembled in front of the prince to receive his award,
when a harsh bugle call from the further end of the lists drew all eyes
to a new and unexpected arrival.
