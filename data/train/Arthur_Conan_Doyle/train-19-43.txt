Well, I read this over now at my leisure, and I marvel at myself!  Is
this Austin Gilroy, the man who has won his way to the front by his
hard reasoning power and by his devotion to fact?  Here I am gravely
retailing the gossip of a woman who tells me how her soul may be
projected from her body, and how, while she lies in a lethargy, she can
control the actions of people at a distance.  Do I accept it?
Certainly not.  She must prove and re-prove before I yield a point.
But if I am still a sceptic, I have at least ceased to be a scoffer.
We are to have a sitting this evening, and she is to try if she can
produce any mesmeric effect upon me.  If she can, it will make an
excellent starting-point for our investigation.  No one can accuse me,
at any rate, of complicity.  If she cannot, we must try and find some
subject who will be like Caesar's wife.  Wilson is perfectly impervious.
