embers until they died gradually out, and the chill night air warned me
that it was time to retire. I may have slept a couple of hours when I was awakened by someone
tugging furiously at my shoulder. Sitting up in bed, I saw by the dim
light that my father was standing half-clad by my bedside, and that it
was his grasp which I felt on my night-shirt.
