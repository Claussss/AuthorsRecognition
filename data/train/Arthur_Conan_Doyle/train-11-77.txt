I dashed the tears of mortification from my eyes, and they laughed the
more at the sight. “Do you know, Captain Pelletan, whether Marshal Lannes is still with the
army?” asked the major. “I believe that he is, sir,” said the other. “Really, I should have thought that his presence was hardly necessary
now that Captain Gerard has arrived.” Again there was a roar of laughter. I can see the ring of faces, the
mocking eyes, the open mouths--Olivier with his great black bristles,
Pelletan thin and sneering, even the young sub-lieutenants convulsed
with merriment. Heavens, the indignity of it! But my rage had dried my
tears. I was myself again, cold, quiet, self-contained, ice without and
fire within.
