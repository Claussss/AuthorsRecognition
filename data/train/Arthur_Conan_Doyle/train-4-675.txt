‘Any signs of the _Fairy Queen_?’ asked the smuggler. ‘None. Long John is down at the water’s edge looking out for her
flash-light. This wind should bring her up if she has rounded
Combe-Martin Point. There was a sail about ten miles to the
east-nor’-east at sundown. She might have been a Bristol schooner, or
she might have been a King’s fly-boat.’ ‘A King’s crawl-boat,’ said Captain Murgatroyd, with a sneer. ‘We cannot
hang the gauger until Venables brings up the _Fairy Queen_, for after
all it was one of his hands that was snackled. Let him do his own dirty
work.’
