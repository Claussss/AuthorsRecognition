"I must see Miss Grey before I leave England.  We have corresponded,
and I think that all will be well.  She must come out with me.  I don't
think I could go without her." The Professor shook his head. "Your nature is not so weak as you pretend," he said.  "Questions of
this sort are, after all, quite subordinate to the great duties of
life." O'Brien smiled. "You would have me take out my Celtic soul and put in a Saxon one," he
said.  "Either my brain is too small or my heart is too big.  But when
may I call and pay my respects to Mrs. Grey?  Will she be at home this
afternoon?"
