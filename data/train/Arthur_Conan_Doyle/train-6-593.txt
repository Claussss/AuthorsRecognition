“By the splendor of God!” said he in a loud clear voice, “I have little
doubt that you will rejoice with me this night, for such tidings have
come to my ears as may well bring joy to everyone of you. You know well
that our ships have suffered great scathe from the Spaniards, who for
many years have slain without grace or ruth all of my people who have
fallen into their cruel hands. Of late they have sent their ships into
Flanders, and thirty great cogs and galleys lie now at Sluys well-filled
with archers and men-at-arms and ready in all ways for battle. I have
it to-day from a sure hand that, having taken their merchandise aboard,
these ships will sail upon the next Sunday and will make their way
through our Narrow Sea. We have for a great time been long-suffering to
these people, for which they have done us many contraries and despites,
growing ever more arrogant as we grow more patient. It is in my mind
therefore that we hie us to-morrow to Winchelsea, where we have twenty
ships, and make ready to sally out upon them as they pass. May God and
Saint George defend the right!”
