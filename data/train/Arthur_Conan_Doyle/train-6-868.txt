It was two hours after tierce, or one hour before noon, on the fourth
Wednesday of Lent in the year of Christ 1351 that the men of Ploermel
rode forth from their castle-gate and crossed the bridge of the Due. In
front was Bambro' with his Squire Croquart, the latter on a great roan
horse bearing the banner of Ploermel, which was a black rampant lion
holding a blue flag upon a field of ermine. Behind him came Robert
Knolles and Nigel Loring, with an attendant at their side, who carried
the pennon of the black raven. Then rode Sir Thomas Percy with his blue
lion flaunting above him, and Sir Hugh Calverly, whose banner bore a
silver owl, followed by the massive Belford who carried a huge iron
club, weighing sixty pounds, upon his saddlebow, and Sir Thomas Walton
the knight of Surrey. Behind them were four brave Anglo-Bretons, Perrot
de Commelain, Le Gaillart, d'Aspremont and d'Ardaine, who fought against
their own countrymen because they were partisans of the Countess of
Montfort. Her engrailed silver cross upon a blue field was carried at
their head. In the rear were five German or Hainault mercenaries, the
tall Hulbitee, and the men-at-arms. Altogether of these combatants
twenty were of English birth, four were Breton and six were of German
blood.
