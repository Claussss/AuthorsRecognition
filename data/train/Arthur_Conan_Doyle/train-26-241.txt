Is Stevenson a classic? Well, it is a large word that. You mean by a
classic a piece of work which passes into the permanent literature
of the country. As a rule, you only know your classics when they are
in their graves. Who guessed it of Poe, and who of Borrow? The Roman
Catholics only canonize their saints a century after their death.
So with our classics. The choice lies with our grandchildren. But I
can hardly think that healthy boys will ever let Stevenson's books
of adventure die, nor do I think that such a short tale as "The
Pavilion on the Links" nor so magnificent a parable as "Dr. Jekyll
and Mr. Hyde" will ever cease to be esteemed. How well I remember
the eagerness, the delight with which I read those early tales in
"Cornhill" away back in the late seventies and early eighties. They
were unsigned, after the old unfair fashion, but no man with any
sense of prose could fail to know that they were all by the same
author. Only years afterwards did I learn who that author was.
