“I have heard to-day, Nigel, how you came to win that great war-horse
which stamps in our stable.” “Nay, dame; I had told you that the monks had given it to me.” “You said so, fair son, but never a word more. Yet the horse which you
brought home was a very different horse I wot, to that which was given
you. Why did you not tell me?” “I should think it shame to talk of such a thing.” “So would your father before you, and his father no less. They would sit
silent among the knights when the wine went round and listen to every
man's deeds; but if perchance there was anyone who spoke louder than the
rest and seemed to be eager for honor, then afterwards your father would
pluck him softly by the sleeve and whisper in his ear to learn if there
was any small vow of which he could relieve him, or if he would deign to
perform some noble deed of arms upon his person. And if the man were a
braggart and would go no further, your father would be silent and none
would know it. But if he bore himself well, your father would spread his
fame far and wide, but never make mention of himself.”
