A line from Calcutta Daisy and another from Hobhouse to say that Matilda
comes in for all the money under the will. I am glad of it. October 3.--Glorious news from the Front today. Barclay, of the Madras
Cavalry, galloped through with dispatches. Pollock entered Cabul
triumphantly on the 16th of last month, and, better still, Lady Sale
has been rescued by Shakespear, and brought safe into the British camp,
together with the other hostages. _Te Deum laudamus!_
