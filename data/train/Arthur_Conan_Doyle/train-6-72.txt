And still, do what he would, the man clung fast to his heaving sides and
to his flying mane, silent, motionless, inexorable, letting him do what
he would, but fixed as Fate upon his purpose. Over Hankley Down, through
Thursley Marsh, with the reeds up to his mud-splashed withers, onward up
the long slope of the Headland of the Hinds, down by the Nutcombe Gorge,
slipping, blundering, bounding, but never slackening his fearful speed,
on went the great yellow horse. The villagers of Shottermill heard the
wild clatter of hoofs, but ere they could swing the ox-hide curtains of
their cottage doors horse and rider were lost amid the high bracken of
the Haslemere Valley. On he went, and on, tossing the miles behind his
flying hoofs. No marsh-land could clog him, no hill could hold him back.
Up the slope of Linchmere and the long ascent of Fernhurst he thundered
as on the level, and it was not until he had flown down the incline of
Henley Hill, and the gray castle tower of Midhurst rose over the coppice
in front, that at last the eager outstretched neck sank a little on
the breast, and the breath came quick and fast. Look where he would in
woodland and on down, his straining eyes could catch no sign of those
plains of freedom which he sought.
