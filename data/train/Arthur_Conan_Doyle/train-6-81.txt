One evening about a week after the breaking of the yellow horse, Nigel
and his grandmother sat on either side of the large empty fireplace in
this spacious apartment. The supper had been removed, and so had the
trestle tables upon which it had been served, so that the room seemed
bare and empty. The stone floor was strewed with a thick layer of green
rushes, which was swept out every Saturday and carried with it all the
dirt and debris of the week. Several dogs were now crouched among these
rushes, gnawing and cracking the bones which had been thrown from the
table. A long wooden buffet loaded with plates and dishes filled one
end of the room, but there was little other furniture save some benches
against the walls, two dorseret chairs, one small table littered with
chessmen, and a great iron coffer. In one corner was a high wickerwork
stand, and on it two stately falcons were perched, silent and
motionless, save for an occasional twinkle of their fierce yellow eyes.
