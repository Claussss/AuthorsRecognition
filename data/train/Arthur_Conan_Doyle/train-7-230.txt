It was a clumsy, old-fashioned thing, but the Colonel saw the glint of a
percussion-cap upon the nipple, and knew that it was loaded. He slipped
it into the inner pocket of his Norfolk jacket. “Thank you,” said he; “speak slowly, so that I may understand you.” “There are eight of us who wish to go to Egypt. There are also four
men in your party. One of us, Mehemet Ali, has fastened twelve camels
together, which are the fastest of all save only those which are ridden
by the Emirs. There are guards upon watch, but they are scattered in all
directions. The twelve camels are close beside us here,--those twelve
behind the acacia-tree. If we can only get mounted and started, I do not
think that many can overtake us, and we shall have our rifles for them.
The guards are not strong enough to stop so many of us. The waterskins
are all filled, and we may see the Nile again by to-morrow night.”
