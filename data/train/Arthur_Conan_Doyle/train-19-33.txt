But I am immensely impressed.  My horizon of scientific possibilities
has suddenly been enormously extended.  I no longer wonder at Wilson's
demonic energy and enthusiasm.  Who would not work hard who had a vast
virgin field ready to his hand?  Why, I have known the novel shape of a
nucleolus, or a trifling peculiarity of striped muscular fibre seen
under a 300-diameter lens, fill me with exultation.  How petty do such
researches seem when compared with this one which strikes at the very
roots of life and the nature of the soul!  I had always looked upon
spirit as a product of matter.  The brain, I thought, secreted the
mind, as the liver does the bile.  But how can this be when I see mind
working from a distance and playing upon matter as a musician might
upon a violin?  The body does not give rise to the soul, then, but is
rather the rough instrument by which the spirit manifests itself.  The
windmill does not give rise to the wind, but only indicates it.  It was
opposed to my whole habit of thought, and yet it was undeniably
possible and worthy of investigation.
