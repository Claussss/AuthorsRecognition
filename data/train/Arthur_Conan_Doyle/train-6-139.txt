“One minute I give you, and no more. Then when I cry 'Loose!' drive me
an arrow through his body.” The shaft was fitted, the bow was bent, and the stern eyes of the
woodman were fixed on his mark. Slowly the minute passed, while Nigel
breathed a prayer to his three soldier saints, not that they should save
his body in this life, but that they should have a kindly care for his
soul in the next. Some thought of a fierce wildcat sally crossed his
mind, but once out of his corner he was lost indeed. Yet at the last
he would have rushed among his enemies, and his body was bent for the
spring, when with a deep sonorous hum, like a breaking harp-string,
the cord of the bow was cloven in twain, and the arrow tinkled upon the
tiled floor. At the same moment a young curly-headed bowman, whose broad
shoulders and deep chest told of immense strength, as clearly as
his frank, laughing face and honest hazel eyes did of good humor and
courage, sprang forward sword in hand and took his place by Nigel's
side.
