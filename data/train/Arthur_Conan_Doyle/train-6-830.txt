Such was the tale to which Nigel and his comrades listened whilst
they waited impatiently for the coming of Knolles and his men. Many
an anxious look did they cast down the black tunnel, but no glimmer of
light and no clash of steel came from its depths. Suddenly, however, a
loud and measured sound broke upon their ears. It was a dull metallic
clang, ponderous and slow, growing louder and ever louder--the tread of
an armored man. The poor wretches round the fire, all unnerved by hunger
and suffering, huddled together with wan, scared faces, their eyes fixed
in terror on the door.
