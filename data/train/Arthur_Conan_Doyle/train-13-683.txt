      was brought, and we all three drove back in it. We had first made
      an examination of the kitchen, and especially of the kitchen
      fire, to see whether she might have made away with the papers
      during the instant that she was alone. There were no signs,
      however, of any ashes or scraps. When we reached Scotland Yard
      she was handed over at once to the female searcher. I waited in
      an agony of suspense until she came back with her report. There
      were no signs of the papers.
