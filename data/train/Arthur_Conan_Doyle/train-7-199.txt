“Well, we'll play the game out, but I'm not very hopeful,” said
Cochrane. “Of course, we must keep the best face we can before the
women. I see that Tippy Tilly is as good as his word, for those five
niggers and the two brown Johnnies must be the men he speaks of. They
all ride together and keep well up, but I can't see how they are going
to help us.” “I've got my pistol back,” whispered Belmont, and his square chin and
strong mouth set like granite. “If they try any games on the women, I
mean to shoot them all three with my own hand, and then we'll die with
our minds easy.”
