“I was in Ghuznee with you when the walls were all shook down by an
earthquake, and when we found forty thousand Afghans within gunshot of
us. You ask me about it, and you'll see whether I'm lying or not. We
went through all this when we were young, and now that we are old you
are to live in a fine bungalow, and I am to starve by the roadside. It
don't seem to me to be fair.” “You are an impertinent scoundrel,” said the general. “If you had been a
good soldier you would never need to ask for help. I shall not give you
a farthing.”
