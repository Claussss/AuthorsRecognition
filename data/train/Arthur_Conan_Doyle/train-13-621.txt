      stood gazing round and wondering where on earth I might be, when
      I saw some one coming towards me in the darkness. As he came up
      to me I made out that he was a railway porter.       “‘Can you tell me what place this is?’ I asked.       “‘Wandsworth Common,’ said he.       “‘Can I get a train into town?’       “‘If you walk on a mile or so to Clapham Junction,’ said he,
      ‘you’ll just be in time for the last to Victoria.’
