      “In the first place,” said Holmes, “I should like you to offer a
      reward—coming from yourself, for the officials may take a little
      time before they would agree upon the sum, and these things
      cannot be done too promptly. I have jotted down the form here, if
      you would not mind signing it. Fifty pounds was quite enough, I
      thought.”       “I would willingly give five hundred,” said the J.P., taking the
      slip of paper and the pencil which Holmes handed to him. “This is
      not quite correct, however,” he added, glancing over the
      document.
