It is not a subject to be dogmatic upon, for I can imagine that
these three writers would appeal quite differently to every
temperament, and that whichever one might desire to champion one
could find arguments to sustain one's choice. Yet I cannot think
that any large section of the critical public could maintain that
Smollett was on the same level as the other two. Ethically he is
gross, though his grossness is accompanied by a full-blooded humour
which is more mirth-compelling than the more polished wit of his
rivals. I can remember in callow boyhood--puris omnia pura--reading
"Peregrine Pickle," and laughing until I cried over the Banquet in
the Fashion of the Ancients. I read it again in my manhood with the
same effect, though with a greater appreciation of its inherent
bestiality. That merit, a gross primitive merit, he has in a high
degree, but in no other respect can he challenge comparison with
either Fielding or Richardson. His view of life is far more limited,
his characters less varied, his incidents less distinctive, and his
thoughts less deep. Assuredly I, for one, should award him the third
place in the trio.
