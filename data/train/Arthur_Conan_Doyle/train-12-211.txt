“Something fabulous, I have no doubt,” said Robert, glancing round at
the yellow barriers. “Shall I say a hundred and fifty thousand pounds?” “Oh dear me, it is surely worth very much more than that,” cried Raffles
Haw, laughing. “Let me see. Suppose that we put it at three ten an
ounce, which is nearly ten shillings under the mark. That makes,
roughly, fifty-six pounds for a pound in weight. Now each of these
ingots weighs thirty-six pounds, which brings their value to two
thousand and a few odd pounds. There are five hundred ingots on each of
these three sides of the room, but on the fourth there are only three
hundred, on account of the door, but there cannot be less than two
hundred on the floor, which gives us a rough total of two thousand
ingots. So you see, my dear boy, that any broker who could get the
contents of this chamber for four million pounds would be doing a nice
little stroke of business.”
