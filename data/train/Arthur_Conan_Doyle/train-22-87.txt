Holmes dismissed the subject with a wave. “No doubt it is an American shotgun,” White Mason continued. “I seem
to have read that a sawed-off shotgun is a weapon used in some parts of
America. Apart from the name upon the barrel, the idea had occurred to
me. There is some evidence then, that this man who entered the house and
killed its master was an American.” MacDonald shook his head. “Man, you are surely travelling overfast,”
 said he. “I have heard no evidence yet that any stranger was ever in the
house at all.”
