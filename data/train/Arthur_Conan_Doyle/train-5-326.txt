He bowed, waved, and was off down the steps to his brougham.  As he
drove away, Lady Clara could see that he was already deeply absorbed in
a paper-covered novel. She pushed back the velvet curtains, and returned into the
drawing-room.  Her daughter stood in the sunlight by the window, tall,
fragile, and exquisite, her features and outline not unlike her
mother's, but frailer, softer, more delicate.  The golden light struck
one half of her high-bred, sensitive face, and glimmered upon her
thickly-coiled flaxen hair, striking a pinkish tint from her
closely-cut costume of fawn-coloured cloth with its dainty cinnamon
ruchings.  One little soft frill of chiffon nestled round her throat,
from which the white, graceful neck and well-poised head shot up like a
lily amid moss.  Her thin white hands were pressed together, and her
blue eyes turned beseechingly upon her mother.
