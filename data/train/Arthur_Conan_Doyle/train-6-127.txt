“Squire Nigel,” said the Abbot, “it was for you, who are, as all men
know, of ancient lineage in this land, to give a fair example by which
others should set their conduct. Instead of this, your manor house has
ever been a center for the stirring up of strife, and now not content
with your harsh showing toward us, the Cistercian monks of Waverley,
you have even marked your contempt for the King's law, and through your
servants have mishandled the person of his messenger. For such offenses
it is in my power to call the spiritual terrors of the Church upon your
head, and yet I would not be harsh with you, seeing that you are young,
and that even last week you saved the life of a servant of the Abbey
when in peril. Therefore, it is by temporal and carnal means that I
will use my power to tame your overbold spirit, and to chasten that
headstrong and violent humor which has caused such scandal in your
dealings with our Abbey. Bread and water for six weeks from now to the
Feast of Saint Benedict, with a daily exhortation from our chaplain,
the pious Father Ambrose, may still avail to bend the stiff neck and to
soften the hard heart.”
