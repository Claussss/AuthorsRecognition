‘Ecod!’ he whispered. ‘He was plaguy hot at first, but he soon came
round, and he hath promised that if I pay for the hire of a dragooner as
long as the war shall last I shall have back the piebald.’ I had been sitting all this time wondering how in the world I was
to conduct my business amid the swarm of suppliants and the crowd of
officers who were attending the Duke. Had there been any likelihood
of my gaining audience with him in any other way I should gladly have
adopted it, but all my endeavours to that end had been useless. Unless I
took this occasion I might never come face to face with him at all.
But how could he give due thought or discussion to such a matter
before others? What chance was there of his weighing it as it should be
weighed? Even if his feelings inclined him that way, he dared not show
any sign of wavering when so many eyes were upon him. I was tempted to
feign some other reason for my coming, and trust to fortune to give me
some more favourable chance for handing him my papers. But then that
chance might never arrive, and time was pressing. It was said that he
would return to Bristol next morning. On the whole, it seemed best that
I should make the fittest use I could of my present position in the hope
that the Duke’s own discretion and self-command might, when he saw the
address upon my despatches, lead to a more private interview.
