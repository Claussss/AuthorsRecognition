Abderrahman, looking at them with his cruel eyes. The Moolah had his reputation to preserve, and it was not for him to
confess to a failure. “They were about to embrace it, when----” “Let it rest for a little time, O Moolah.” He gave an order, and the
Arabs all sprang for their camels. The Emir Wad Ibrahim filed off at
once with nearly half the party. The others were mounted and ready, with
their rifles unslung.
