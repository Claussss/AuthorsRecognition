talons and ruffled plumes, were torn apart and brought back bleeding and
panting to their perches, while the heron after its perilous adventure
flapped its way heavily onward to settle safely in the heronry of
Waverley. The cortege, who had scattered in the excitement of the chase,
came together again, and the journey was once more resumed.
