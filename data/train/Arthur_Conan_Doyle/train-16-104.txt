held in such high esteem by our ancestors, that some famous professors
of it, such as the great Gully, have been elected to the highest offices
of the State. There were men of the highest character amongst the

have been given to understand, was Winter. This, however, has nothing to
do with the matter in hand, which is that you must fight me."
