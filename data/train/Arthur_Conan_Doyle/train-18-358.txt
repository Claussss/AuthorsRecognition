Though it affects me specially, as being the person most concerned, I am
still conscious that the natural sympathy which I have observed in you,
and your regard for Gabriel's father, would both combine to render you
unhappy if you knew the hopelessness and yet the vagueness of the fate
which threatens me. I feared to disturb your mind, and I was therefore
silent, though at some cost to myself, for my isolation has not been the
least of the troubles which have weighed me down.
