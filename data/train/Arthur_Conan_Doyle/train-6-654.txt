“It is even as I say, sire. The ship is sinking beneath our feet!” he
cried. “The more need that we should gain another,” said he. “Sir Henry Stokes,
Sir Thomas Stourton, William, John of Clifton, here lies our road!
Advance my banner, Thomas de Mohun! On, and the day is ours!” By a desperate scramble a dozen men, the Prince at their head, gained
a footing on the edge of the Spaniard's deck. Some slashed furiously to
clear a space, others hung over, clutching the rail with one hand and
pulling up their comrades from below. Every instant that they could hold
their own their strength increased, till twenty had become thirty and
thirty forty, when of a sudden the newcomers, still reaching forth to
their comrades below, saw the deck beneath them reel and vanish in a
swirling sheet of foam. The Prince's ship had foundered.
