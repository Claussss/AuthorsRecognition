For Sir Alleyne Edricson and for his beautiful bride the future had also
naught but what was good. Twice he fought in France, and came back each
time laden with honors. A high place at court was given to him, and
he spent many years at Windsor under the second Richard and the fourth
Henry--where he received the honor of the Garter, and won the name of
being a brave soldier, a true-hearted gentleman, and a great lover and
patron of every art and science which refines or ennobles life.
