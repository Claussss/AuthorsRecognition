On the farther side of Puttenham the road runs through thick woods of
oak and beech, with a tangled undergrowth of fern and bramble. Here they
met a patrol of sergeants-at-arms, tall fellows, well-mounted, clad in
studded-leather caps and tunics, with lances and swords. They walked
their horses slowly on the shady side of the road, and stopped as the
travelers came up, to ask if they had been molested on the way.
