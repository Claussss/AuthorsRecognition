this silent night would be heard for miles.  Keep it as a last card." "If it gets over the hedge we're done," said Summerlee, and his voice
crackled into a nervous laugh as he spoke. "No, it must not get over," cried Lord John; "but hold your fire to the
last.  Perhaps I can make something of the fellow.  I'll chance it,
anyhow."
