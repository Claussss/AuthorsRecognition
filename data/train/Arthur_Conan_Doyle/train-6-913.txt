And then, then at last, when all hope was well-nigh dead in his heart,
there came one glorious July morning which brought a horseman bearing
a letter to the Castle of Vannes, of which Nigel now was seneschal. It
contained but few words, short and clear as the call of a war-trumpet.
It was Chandos who wrote. He needed his Squire at his side, for his
pennon was in the breeze once more. He was at Bordeaux. The Prince was
starting at once for Bergerac, whence he would make a great raid into
France. It would not end without a battle. They had sent word of their
coming, and the good French King had promised to be at great pains to
receive them. Let Nigel hasten at once. If the army had left, then let
him follow after with all speed. Chandos had three other squires, but
would very gladly see his fourth once again, for he had heard much of
him since he parted, and nothing which he might not have expected to
hear of his father's son. Such was the letter which made the summer sun
shine brighter and the blue sky seem of a still fairer blue upon that
happy morning in Vannes.
