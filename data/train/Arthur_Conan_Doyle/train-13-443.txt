      “Get it printed as soon as possible,” he said; “I think your idea
      is an excellent one.”       Holmes put the slip of paper carefully away into his pocket-book.       “And now,” said he, “it really would be a good thing that we
      should all go over the house together and make certain that this
      rather erratic burglar did not, after all, carry anything away
      with him.”       Before entering, Holmes made an examination of the door which had
      been forced. It was evident that a chisel or strong knife had
      been thrust in, and the lock forced back with it. We could see
      the marks in the wood where it had been pushed in.
