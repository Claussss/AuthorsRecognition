      Sherlock Holmes was as good as his word, for about one o’clock he
      rejoined us in the Colonel’s smoking-room. He was accompanied by
      a little elderly gentleman, who was introduced to me as the Mr.
      Acton whose house had been the scene of the original burglary.       “I wished Mr. Acton to be present while I demonstrated this small
      matter to you,” said Holmes, “for it is natural that he should
      take a keen interest in the details. I am afraid, my dear
      Colonel, that you must regret the hour that you took in such a
      stormy petrel as I am.”
