The second book to which I alluded is Wallace's "Malay Archipelago."
There is a strange similarity in the minds of the two men, the same
courage, both moral and physical, the same gentle persistence, the
same catholic knowledge and wide. sweep of mind, the same passion
for the observation of Nature. Wallace by a flash of intuition
understood and described in a letter to Darwin the cause of the
Origin of Species at the very time when the latter was publishing
a book founded upon twenty years' labour to prove the same thesis.
What must have been his feelings when he read that letter? And yet
he had nothing to fear, for his book found no more enthusiastic
admirer than the man who had in a sense anticipated it. Here also
one sees that Science has its heroes no less than Religion. One of
Wallace's missions in Papua was to examine the nature and species
of the Birds-of-Paradise; but in the course of the years of his
wanderings through those islands he made a complete investigation
of the whole fauna. A footnote somewhere explains that the Papuans
who lived in the Bird-of-Paradise country were confirmed cannibals.
Fancy living for years with or near such neighbours! Let a young
fellow read these two books, and he cannot fail to have both his
mind and his spirit strengthened by the reading.
