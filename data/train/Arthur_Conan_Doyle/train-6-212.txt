“I would not ask it,” said the “Wild Man,” “for I can get your bag and
yet never stir from the spot where I stand. Have I your promise upon
your honor and all that you hold dear that you will ask for grace?” “You have.” “And that my wife shall be unharmed?” “I promise it.” The outlaw laid back his head and uttered a long shrill cry like the
howl of a wolf. There was a silent pause, and then, clear and shrill,
there rose the same cry no great distance away in the forest. Again the
“Wild Man” called, and again his mate replied. A third time he summoned,
as the deer bells to the doe in the greenwood. Then with a rustle of
brushwood and snapping of twigs the woman was before them once more,
tall, pale, graceful, wonderful. She glanced neither at Aylward nor
Nigel, but ran to the side of her husband.
