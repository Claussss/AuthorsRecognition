“And beyond that, fair son?” “Beyond that is Jerusalem and the Holy Land, and the great river which
hath its source in the Garden of Eden.” “And then?” “Nay, good father, I cannot tell. Methinks the end of the world is not
far from there.” “Then we can still find something to teach thee, Alleyne,” said the
Abbot complaisantly. “Know that many strange nations lie betwixt there
and the end of the world. There is the country of the Amazons, and the
country of the dwarfs, and the country of the fair but evil women who
slay with beholding, like the basilisk. Beyond that again is the kingdom
of Prester John and of the great Cham. These things I know for very
sooth, for I had them from that pious Christian and valiant knight, Sir
John de Mandeville, who stopped twice at Beaulieu on his way to and from
Southampton, and discoursed to us concerning what he had seen from the
reader's desk in the refectory, until there was many a good brother who
got neither bit nor sup, so stricken were they by his strange tales.”
