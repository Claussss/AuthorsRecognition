“Would you care to see one?” “Oh, immensely.” “I will have one sent down. Let me see, it is nearly twelve o'clock. I
can get a wire to Liverpool by one. There is a man there who deals in

I shall look forward to seeing you all before very long. I have rather
outstayed my time, for I am a man of routine, and I always put in a
certain number of hours in my laboratory.” He shook hands cordially with
them all, and lighting his pipe at the doorstep, strolled off upon his
way.
