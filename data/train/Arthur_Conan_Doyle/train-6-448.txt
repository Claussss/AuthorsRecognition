But apart from the rolling country upon the left and the great
forest-hidden plain upon the right, there was much upon the road itself
to engage the attention of the wayfarers. It was crowded with people.
As far as their eyes could carry they could see the black dots scattered
thickly upon the thin white band, sometimes single, sometimes several
abreast, sometimes in moving crowds, where a drove of pilgrims held
together for mutual protection, or a nobleman showed his greatness by
the number of retainers who trailed at his heels. At that time the main
roads were very crowded, for there were many wandering people in the
land. Of all sorts and kinds, they passed in an unbroken stream before
the eyes of Nigel and of Aylward, alike only in the fact that one and
all were powdered from their hair to their shoes with the gray dust of
the chalk.
