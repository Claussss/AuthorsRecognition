‘Who is the leader of this conventicle?’ he asked. ‘Address your message to me, sir,’ said our leader from the top of
the waggon, ‘but understand that your white flag will only protect you
whilst you use such language as may come from one courteous adversary to
another. Say your say or retire.’ ‘Courtesy and honour,’ said the officer, with a sneer, ‘are not extended
to rebels who are in arms against their lawful sovereign. If you are the
leader of this rabble, I warn you if they are not dispersed within five
minutes by this watch’--he pulled out an elegant gold time-piece--‘we
shall ride down upon them and cut them to pieces.’
