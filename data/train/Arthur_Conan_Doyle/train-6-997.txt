But the Prince's courage flamed the higher as the shadow fell, while his
dark eyes gleamed with a soldier's pride as he glanced round him at his
weary comrades, and then at the dense masses of the King's battle which
now, with a hundred trumpets blaring and a thousand pennons waving,
rolled slowly over the plain. “Come what may, John, this has been a most
noble meeting,” said he. “They will not be ashamed of us in England.
Take heart, my friends, for if we conquer we shall carry the glory ever
with us; but if we be slain then we die most worshipfully and in high
honor, as we have ever prayed that we might die, and we leave behind
us our brothers and kinsmen who will assuredly avenge us. It is but one
more effort, and all will be well. Warwick, Oxford, Salisbury, Suffolk,
every man to the front! My banner to the front also! Your horses, fair
sirs! The archers are spent, and our own good lances must win the
field this day. Advance, Walter, and may God and Saint George be with
England!”
