McMurdo had obtained a temporary job as bookkeeper for he was a
well-educated man. This kept him out most of the day, and he had not
found occasion yet to report himself to the head of the lodge of the
Eminent Order of Freemen. He was reminded of his omission, however, by
a visit one evening from Mike Scanlan, the fellow member whom he had met
in the train. Scanlan, the small, sharp-faced, nervous, black-eyed man,
seemed glad to see him once more. After a glass or two of whisky he
broached the object of his visit.
