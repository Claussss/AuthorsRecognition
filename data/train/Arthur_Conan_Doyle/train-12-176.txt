dimmer grew the vision of the distant sailor face, clearer and clearer
the image of the vast palace, of the queenly power, of the diamonds, the

up. How could she have hesitated, even for a moment? She rose, and,
walking over to her desk, she took out a sheet of paper and an envelope.
The latter she addressed to Lieutenant Spurling, H.M.S. _Active_,
Gibraltar. The note cost some little trouble, but at last she got it
worded to her mind.
