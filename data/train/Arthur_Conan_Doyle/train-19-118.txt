Mid-day.  The thing has come to a crisis.  My life is not worth living.
But, if I am to die, then she shall come also.  I will not leave her
behind, to drive some other man mad as she has me.  No, I have come to
the limit of my endurance.  She has made me as desperate and dangerous
a man as walks the earth.  God knows I have never had the heart to hurt
a fly, and yet, if I had my hands now upon that woman, she should never
leave this room alive.  I shall see her this very day, and she shall
learn what she has to expect from me.
