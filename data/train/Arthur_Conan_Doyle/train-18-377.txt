If you are making war you should throw no chance away. I hate
half-and-half measures. The Children of Israel seem to have been the
only people who ever carried war to its logical conclusion--except
Cromwell in Ireland. Made a compromise at last by which the man is to
be detained as a prisoner and executed if his information prove to be
false. I only hope we get a fair chance of showing what we can do.
