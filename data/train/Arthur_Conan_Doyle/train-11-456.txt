that a man could be expected to do--some would say more--but at last I
had come to a point from which I could see no escape. The horses of my

losing blood fast, and we left a red trail upon the white, dusty road.
Already his pace was slackening, and sooner or later he must drop under
me. I looked back, and there were the five inevitable Prussians--Stein
a hundred yards in front, then a Lancer, and then three others riding
together.
