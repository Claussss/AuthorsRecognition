     "Since Sir William told me how weak your heart is, and how
     harmful any shock might be, I have never talked about my
     business affairs to you. The time has come when at all risks I
     can no longer refrain from telling you that things have been
     going badly with me. This will cause me to leave you for a
     little time, but it is with the absolute assurance that we
     shall see each other very soon. On this you can thoroughly
     rely. Our parting is only for a very short time, my own
     darling, so don't let it fret you, and above all don't let it
     impair your health, for that is what I want above all things to
     avoid.
