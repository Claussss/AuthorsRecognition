“It's just too beautiful, this purple sky and the great silver stars,”
 said Sadie. “Look at the silent desert and the black shadows of the
hills. It's grand, but it's terrible, too; and then when you think that
we really _are_, as that dragoman said just now, on the very end of
civilisation, and with nothing but savagery and bloodshed down there
where the Southern Cross is twinkling so prettily, why, it's like
standing on the beautiful edge of a live volcano.”
