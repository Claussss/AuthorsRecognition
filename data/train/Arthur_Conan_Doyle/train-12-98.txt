“Shall we go upstairs?” said Robert hurriedly, anxious to divert his
guest's attention from this little domestic incident. “My studio is the
real atelier, for it is right up under the tiles. I shall lead the way,
if you will have the kindness to follow me.” Leaving Laura and Mr. McIntyre, they went up together to the workroom.
Mr. Haw stood long in front of the “Signing of Magna Charta,” and
the “Murder of Thomas a Becket,” screwing up his eyes and twitching
nervously at his beard, while Robert stood by in anxious expectancy.
