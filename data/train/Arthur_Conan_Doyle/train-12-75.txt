Robert chuckled to himself. “I know that dress pretty well,” he said. “It is my sister Laura whom
you describe.” “Your sister! Really! Why, there is a resemblance, now that my attention
is called to it. I saw her the other day, and wondered who she might be.
She lives with you, of course?” “Yes; my father, she, and I live together at Elmdene.” “Where I hope to have the pleasure of making their acquaintance. You
have finished your cigar? Have another, or try a pipe. To the real
smoker all is mere trifling save the pipe. I have most brands of tobacco
here. The lockers are filled on the Monday, and on Saturday they are
handed over to the old folk at the alms-houses, so I manage to keep it
pretty fresh always. Well, if you won't take anything else, perhaps you
would care to see one or two of the other effects which I have devised.
On this side is the armoury, and beyond it the library. My collection of
books is a limited one; there are just over the fifty thousand volumes.
But it is to some extent remarkable for quality. I have a Visigoth Bible
of the fifth century, which I rather fancy is unique; there is a 'Biblia
Pauperum' of 1430; a MS. of Genesis done upon mulberry leaves, probably
of the second century; a 'Tristan and Iseult' of the eighth century; and
some hundred black-letters, with five very fine specimens of Schoffer
and Fust. But those you may turn over any wet afternoon when you have
nothing better to do. Meanwhile, I have a little device connected with
this smoking-room which may amuse you. Light this other cigar. Now sit
with me upon this lounge which stands at the further end of the room.”
