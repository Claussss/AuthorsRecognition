By this time night had closed in save for a single long, narrow slit in
the westward. Stumbling across the moor together, we made our way into
the Wigtown Road, at the point where the high stone pillars mark the
entrance to the Cloomber avenue. A tall dog-cart stood in front of the
gateway, the horse browsing upon the thin border of grass which skirted
the road. “It's a' richt!” said Jamieson, taking a close look at the deserted
vehicle. “I ken it weel. It belongs tae Maister McNeil, the factor body
frae Wigtown--him wha keeps the keys.”
