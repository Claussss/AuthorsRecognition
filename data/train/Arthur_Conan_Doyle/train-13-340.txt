      “‘The rest I need not relate. We prospered, we travelled, we came
      back as rich colonials to England, and we bought country estates.
      For more than twenty years we have led peaceful and useful lives,
      and we hoped that our past was forever buried. Imagine, then, my
      feelings when in the seaman who came to us I recognised instantly
      the man who had been picked off the wreck. He had tracked us down
      somehow, and had set himself to live upon our fears. You will
      understand now how it was that I strove to keep the peace with
      him, and you will in some measure sympathise with me in the fears
      which fill me, now that he has gone from me to his other victim
      with threats upon his tongue.’
