Nigel, still bound, had been placed with his back against the iron
coffer, whence he heard with dry lips and moist brow this doom of his
house. Now he broke in on the recital with a vehemence which made the
summoner jump: “You shall rue what you have done this night!” he cried. “Poor as we
are, we have our friends who will not see us wronged, and I will plead
my cause before the King's own majesty at Windsor, that he, who saw the
father die, may know what things are done in his royal name against the
son. But these matters are to be settled in course of law in the King's
courts, and how will you excuse yourself for this assault upon my house
and person?”
