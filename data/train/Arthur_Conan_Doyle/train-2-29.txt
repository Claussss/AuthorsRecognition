smoked hard, with his brows drawn down over his keen eyes, and his head
thrust forward in the eager way characteristic of the man. “Well, Watson,” he asked, turning suddenly upon me, “what do you make
of it?” “I can make nothing of this mystification of Scott Eccles.” “But the crime?” “Well, taken with the disappearance of the man’s companions, I should
say that they were in some way concerned in the murder and had fled
from justice.”
