      Holmes and I followed them down the lane, and my friend plucked
      at my sleeve as we came out.       “I think,” said he, “that we shall be of more use in London than
      in Norbury.”       Not another word did he say of the case until late that night,
      when he was turning away, with his lighted candle, for his
      bedroom.       “Watson,” said he, “if it should ever strike you that I am
      getting a little over-confident in my powers, or giving less
      pains to a case than it deserves, kindly whisper ‘Norbury’ in my
      ear, and I shall be infinitely obliged to you.”
