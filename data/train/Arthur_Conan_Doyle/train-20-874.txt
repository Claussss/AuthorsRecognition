      I could see from Holmes’s rigid face that he was vibrating with
      inward excitement.       “Look here, Lestrade,” said he, “has that constable in the
      passage been in charge of the place all the time?”       “Yes, he has.”       “Well, take my advice. Examine him carefully. Don’t do it before
      us. We’ll wait here. You take him into the back room. You’ll be
      more likely to get a confession out of him alone. Ask him how he
      dared to admit people and leave them alone in this room. Don’t
      ask him if he has done it. Take it for granted. Tell him you
      _know_ someone has been here. Press him. Tell him that a full
      confession is his only chance of forgiveness. Do exactly what I
      tell you!”
