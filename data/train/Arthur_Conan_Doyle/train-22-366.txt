Morris had turned deadly pale, and his knees seemed to give way under
him as he fell back into his chair. He raised his glass in his trembling

to you and to every brother in this lodge if I have said more than I
should. I am a faithful member--you all know that--and it is my fear

have greater trust in your judgment than in my own, Eminent Bodymaster,
and I promise you that I will not offend again.”
