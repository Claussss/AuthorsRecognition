      “Beg pardon, sir,” said our page-boy, as he opened the door.
      “There’s been a gentleman here asking for you, sir.”       Holmes glanced reproachfully at me. “So much for afternoon
      walks!” said he. “Has this gentleman gone, then?”       “Yes, sir.”       “Didn’t you ask him in?”       “Yes, sir; he came in.”       “How long did he wait?”       “Half an hour, sir. He was a very restless gentleman, sir,
      a-walkin’ and a-stampin’ all the time he was here. I was waitin’
      outside the door, sir, and I could hear him. At last he outs into
      the passage, and he cries, ‘Is that man never goin’ to come?’
      Those were his very words, sir. ‘You’ll only need to wait a
      little longer,’ says I. ‘Then I’ll wait in the open air, for I
      feel half choked,’ says he. ‘I’ll be back before long.’ And with
      that he ups and he outs, and all I could say wouldn’t hold him
      back.”
