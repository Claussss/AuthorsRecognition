‘I have taken blows and given them ere you were ever thought of, you
land-swab,’ roared old Solomon. ‘I was yardarm and yardarm with De
Ruyter when you were learning to suck milk; but, old as I am, I would
have you know that I am not condemned yet, and that I am fit to exchange
broadsides with any lobster-tailed piccaroon that ever was triced up to
a triangle and had the King’s diamonds cut in his back. If I tack back
to Major Ogilvy and signal him the way that I have been welcomed, he’ll
make your hide redder than ever your coat was.’
