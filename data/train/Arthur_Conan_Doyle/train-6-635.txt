King Edward had been lying all day in his great ship the Philippa, a
mile out from the Camber Sands, waiting for the coming of the Spaniards.
Above the huge sail which bore the royal arms flew the red cross of
England. Along the bulwarks were shown the shields of forty knights, the
flower of English chivalry, and as many pennons floated from the deck.
The high ends of the ship glittered with the weapons of the men-at-arms,
and the waist was crammed with the archers. From time to time a crash of
nakers and blare of trumpets burst from the royal ship, and was answered
by her great neighbors, the Lion on which the Black Prince flew his
flag, the Christopher with the Earl of Suffolk, the Salle du Roi of
Robert of Namur, and the Grace Marie of Sir Thomas Holland. Farther off
lay the White Swan, bearing the arms of Mowbray, the Palmer of Deal,
flying the Black Head of Audley, and the Kentish man under the Lord
Beauchamp. The rest lay, anchored but ready, at the mouth of Winchelsea
Creek.
