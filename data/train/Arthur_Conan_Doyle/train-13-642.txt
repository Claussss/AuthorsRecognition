      “We can enter in a minute,” he gasped, darting out again. “Where
      is a candle? I doubt if we could strike a match in that
      atmosphere. Hold the light at the door and we shall get them out,
      Mycroft, now!”       With a rush we got to the poisoned men and dragged them out into
      the well-lit hall. Both of them were blue-lipped and insensible,
      with swollen, congested faces and protruding eyes. Indeed, so
      distorted were their features that, save for his black beard and
      stout figure, we might have failed to recognise in one of them
      the Greek interpreter who had parted from us only a few hours
      before at the Diogenes Club. His hands and feet were securely
      strapped together, and he bore over one eye the marks of a
      violent blow. The other, who was secured in a similar fashion,
      was a tall man in the last stage of emaciation, with several
      strips of sticking-plaster arranged in a grotesque pattern over
      his face. He had ceased to moan as we laid him down, and a glance
      showed me that for him at least our aid had come too late. Mr.
      Melas, however, still lived, and in less than an hour, with the
      aid of ammonia and brandy I had the satisfaction of seeing him
      open his eyes, and of knowing that my hand had drawn him back
      from that dark valley in which all paths meet.
