"Our young friend here knows where they live.  I gather that it is some
distance." "A good twenty miles," said I. Summerlee gave a groan. "I, for one, could never get there.  Surely I hear those brutes still
howling upon our track." As he spoke, from the dark recesses of the woods we heard far away the
jabbering cry of the ape-men.  The Indians once more set up a feeble
wail of fear. "We must move, and move quick!" said Lord John.  "You help Summerlee,
young fellah.  These Indians will carry stores.  Now, then, come along
before they can see us."
