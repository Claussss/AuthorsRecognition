“Nay, you cannot vex me,” he answered, all warm again at the very sight
of her. “It was my rough words which vexed you; but I have been thrown
among men all my life, and indeed, with all the will, I scarce know how
to temper my speech to a lady's ear.” “Then unsay it,” cried she quickly; “say that I was right to wish to
have vengeance on the Socman.” “Nay, I cannot do that,” he answered gravely. “Then who is ungentle and unkind now?” she cried in triumph. “How stern
and cold you are for one so young! Art surely no mere clerk, but bishop
or cardinal at the least. Shouldst have crozier for staff and mitre
for cap. Well, well, for your sake I will forgive the Socman and take
vengeance on none but on my own wilful self who must needs run into
danger's path. So will that please you, sir?”
