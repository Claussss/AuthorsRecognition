“I thank you for your courtesy, good father Abbot,” said Chandos
carelessly. “This young Squire has, however, a better friend than
myself, one who is kinder to those he loves and more terrible to those
he hates. It is from him I bear a message.” “I pray you, fair and honored sir,” said Nigel, “that you will tell me
what is the message that you bear.” “The message, mon ami, is that your friend comes into these parts and
would have a night's lodging at the manor house of Tilford for the love
and respect that he bears your family.”
