Elliott of the Artillery, and I, are answerable for the safety of the
communications for a distance of twenty miles or more, from the mouth of
the valley to this side of the wooden bridge over the Lotar. Goodenough,
of the Rifles, is responsible on the other side, and Lieutenant-Colonel
Sidney Herbert of the Engineers, has a general supervision over both
sections. Our force is not strong enough for the work which has to be done. I have
a company and a half of our own regiment, and a squadron of Sowars,
who are of no use at all among the rocks. Elliott has three guns, but
several of his men are down with cholera, and I doubt if he has enough
to serve more than two.
