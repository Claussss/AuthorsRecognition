“She was well, my fair lord, and sent her service and greetings to you.” “I am ever her knight and slave. And your journey, I trust that it was
pleasant?” “As heart could wish. We had sight of two rover galleys, and even came
to have some slight bickering with them.” “Ever in luck's way, Nigel!” quoth Sir John. “We must hear the tale
anon. But I deem it best that ye should leave your squires and come with
me, for, howsoe'er pressed the prince may be, I am very sure that he
would be loth to keep two old comrades-in-arms upon the further side of
the door. Follow close behind me, and I will forestall old Sir William,
though I can scarce promise to roll forth your style and rank as is
his wont.” So saying, he led the way to the inner chamber, the two
companions treading close at his heels, and nodding to right and left as
they caught sight of familiar faces among the crowd.
