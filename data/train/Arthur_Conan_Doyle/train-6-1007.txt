Dazed with the shock, Nigel still kept his saddle, and Pommers, his
yellow hide mottled with blood, bore him onward with the others. The
French horsemen were now in full flight; but one stern group of knights
stood firm, like a rock in a rushing torrent, beating off all, whether
friend or foe, who tried to break their ranks. The oriflamme had gone,
and so had the blue and silver banner, but here were desperate men ready
to fight to the death. In their ranks honor was to be reaped. The Prince
and his following hurled themselves upon them, while the rest of the
English horsemen swept onward to secure the fugitives and to win their
ransoms. But the nobler spirits--Audley, Chandos and the others--would
have thought it shame to gain money whilst there was work to be done or
honor to be won. Furious was the wild attack, desperate the prolonged
defense. Men fell from their saddles for very exhaustion.
