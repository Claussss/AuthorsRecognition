“Not quite so bad as that,” she said, smiling. “But do come out, Jack. I
should very much like you to see it.” I had always refrained from saying anything which might alarm my sister,
so that she knew nothing of the interest which our neighbours' doings
had for me. At her request I took my hat and followed her out into the
darkness. She led the way along a little footpath over the moor, which
brought us to some rising ground, from which we could look down upon the
Hall without our view being obstructed by any of the fir-trees which had
been planted round it.
