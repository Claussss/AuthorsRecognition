There on the left of Gibbon is my fine edition (Lord Braybrooke's)
of Pepys' Diary. That is, in truth, the greatest autobiography in
our language, and yet it was not deliberately written as such. When
Mr. Pepys jotted down from day to day every quaint or mean thought
which came into his head he would have been very much surprised
had any one told him that he was doing a work quite unique in our
literature. Yet his involuntary autobiography, compiled for some
obscure reason or for private reference, but certainly never meant
for publication, is as much the first in that line of literature
as Boswell's book among biographies or Gibbon's among histories.
