      “And you intend to ask him?”       “Most certainly—but in the presence of a witness.”       “And I am the witness?”       “If you will be so good. If he can clear the matter up, well and
      good. If he refuses, we have no alternative but to apply for a
      warrant.”       “But how do you know he’ll be there when we return?”       “You may be sure that I took some precautions. I have one of my
      Baker Street boys mounting guard over him who would stick to him
      like a burr, go where he might. We shall find him in Hudson
      Street to-morrow, Watson, and meanwhile I should be the criminal
      myself if I kept you out of bed any longer.”
