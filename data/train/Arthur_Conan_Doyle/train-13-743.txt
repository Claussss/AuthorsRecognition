      that I never quite know what to make of him. Do you think he is

      generally says so. It is when he is on a scent and is not quite
      absolutely sure yet that it is the right one that he is most
      taciturn. Now, my dear fellow, we can’t help matters by making
      ourselves nervous about them, so let me implore you to go to bed
      and so be fresh for whatever may await us to-morrow.”
