No one, as it chanced, was going the same way as themselves, but they
met one large drove of pilgrims returning from their journey with
pictures of Saint Thomas and snails' shells or little leaden ampullae
in their hats and bundles of purchases over their shoulders. They were a
grimy, ragged, travel-stained crew, the men walking, the women borne
on asses. Man and beast, they limped along as if it would be a glad
day when they saw their homes once more. These and a few beggars or
minstrels, who crouched among the heather on either side of the track
in the hope of receiving an occasional farthing from the passer-by, were
the only folk they met until they had reached the village of Puttenham.
Already there, was a hot sun and just breeze enough to send the dust
flying down the road, so they were glad to clear their throats with a
glass of beer at the ale-stake in the village, where the fair alewife
gave Nigel a cold farewell because he had no attentions for her, and
Aylward a box on the ear because he had too many.
