“It would take a clever man to live upon thy labor, Hugh,” remarked one
of the foresters, “seeing that the half of thy time is spent in swilling
mead at the 'Pied Merlin.'” “Better that than stealing the deer that thou art placed to guard, like
some folk I know.” “If you dare open that swine's mouth against me,” shouted the woodman,
“I'll crop your ears for you before the hangman has the doing of it,
thou long-jawed lackbrain.”
