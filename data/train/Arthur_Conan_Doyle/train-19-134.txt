The time for indecision was at an end.  As long as the creature
threatened my own prospects and my honor there might be a question as
to what I should do.  But now, when Agatha--my innocent Agatha--was
endangered, my duty lay before me like a turnpike road.  I had no
weapon, but I never paused for that.  What weapon should I need, when I
felt every muscle quivering with the strength of a frenzied man?  I ran
through the streets, so set upon what I had to do that I was only dimly
conscious of the faces of friends whom I met--dimly conscious also
that Professor Wilson met me, running with equal precipitance in the
opposite direction.  Breathless but resolute I reached the house and
rang the bell.  A white cheeked maid opened the door, and turned whiter
yet when she saw the face that looked in at her.
