      “‘Where is your mistress?’ I asked.       “‘I think that she has gone out for a walk,’ she answered.       “My mind was instantly filled with suspicion. I rushed upstairs
      to make sure that she was not in the house. As I did so I
      happened to glance out of one of the upper windows, and saw the
      maid with whom I had just been speaking running across the field
      in the direction of the cottage. Then of course I saw exactly
      what it all meant. My wife had gone over there, and had asked the
      servant to call her if I should return. Tingling with anger, I
      rushed down and hurried across, determined to end the matter once
      and forever. I saw my wife and the maid hurrying back along the
      lane, but I did not stop to speak with them. In the cottage lay
      the secret which was casting a shadow over my life. I vowed that,
      come what might, it should be a secret no longer. I did not even
      knock when I reached it, but turned the handle and rushed into
      the passage.
