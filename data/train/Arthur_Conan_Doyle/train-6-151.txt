The Abbot was little used to hear such words of reproof uttered in so
stern a voice under his own abbey roof and before his listening monks.
“You may perchance find that an Abbey court has more powers than you
wot of, Sir Knight,” said he, “if knight indeed you be who are so
uncourteous and short in your speech. Ere we go further, I would ask
your name and style?” The stranger laughed. “It is easy to see that you are indeed men of
peace,” said he proudly. “Had I shown this sign,” and he touched the
token upon his lapels, “whether on shield or pennon, in the marches of
France or Scotland, there is not a cavalier but would have known the red
pile of Chandos.”
