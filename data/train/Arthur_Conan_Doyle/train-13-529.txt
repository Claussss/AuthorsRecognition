      A pale, taper-faced man with sandy whiskers rose up from a chair
      by the fire as we entered. His age may not have been more than
      three or four and thirty, but his haggard expression and
      unhealthy hue told of a life which has sapped his strength and
      robbed him of his youth. His manner was nervous and shy, like
      that of a sensitive gentleman, and the thin white hand which he
      laid on the mantelpiece as he rose was that of an artist rather
      than of a surgeon. His dress was quiet and sombreâ€”a black
      frock-coat, dark trousers, and a touch of colour about his
      necktie.
