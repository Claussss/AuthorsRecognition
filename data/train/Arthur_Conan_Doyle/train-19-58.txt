Weak as I have proved myself to be, I am still strong enough to bring
this sort of thing to an end.  It shall not happen again.  I have sense
enough to fly when I cannot fight.  From this Sunday night onward I
shall never sit with Miss Penclosa again.  Never!  Let the experiments
go, let the research come to an end; any thing is better than facing
this monstrous temptation which drags me so low.  I have said nothing
to Miss Penclosa, but I shall simply stay away.  She can tell the
reason without any words of mine.
