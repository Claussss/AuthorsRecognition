“What are these treasures, then, father?” asked Hordle John. “I can but
see an old rusty nail, with bits of stone and slips of wood.” “My friend,” answered the palmer, “not all the money that is in this
country could pay a just price for these wares of mine. This nail,” he
continued, pulling off his hat and turning up his sightless orbs, “is
one of those wherewith man's salvation was secured. I had it, together
with this piece of the true rood, from the five-and-twentieth descendant
of Joseph of Arimathea, who still lives in Jerusalem alive and well,
though latterly much afflicted by boils. Aye, you may well cross
yourselves, and I beg that you will not breathe upon it or touch it with
your fingers.”
