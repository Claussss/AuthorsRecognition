The students were pouring down the sloping street which led to the
infirmary--each with his little sheaf of note-books in his hand. There
were pale, frightened lads, fresh from the High Schools, and callous old
chronics, whose generation had passed on and left them. They swept in an
unbroken, tumultuous stream from the University gate to the hospital.
The figures and gait of the men were young, but there was little youth
in most of their faces. Some looked as if they ate too little--a few as
if they drank too much. Tall and short, tweed coated and black,
round-shouldered, bespectacled and slim, they crowded with clatter of
feet and rattle of sticks through the hospital gate. Now and again they
thickened into two lines as the carriage of a surgeon of the staff
rolled over the cobblestones between.
