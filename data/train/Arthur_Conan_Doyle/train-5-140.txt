"Yes, I have written on the subject." "Ha!  Well, then, where's Mason?" "I have not the pleasure of his acquaintance." "No?--that's queer too.  He knows you and thinks a lot of your opinion.
You're a stranger in the town, are you not?" "Yes, I have only been here a very short time." "That was what Mason said.  He didn't give me the address.  Said he
would call on you and bring you, but when the wife got worse of course
I inquired for you and sent for you direct.  I sent for Mason, too, but
he was out.  However, we can't wait for him, so just run away upstairs
and do what you can."
