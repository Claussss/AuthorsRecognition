I had come to look upon the inhabitants of the Hall as mere eccentrics,
but after what young Mordaunt Heatherstone had just told me, I could
no longer doubt that some dark and sinister meaning underlay all their
actions. The more I pondered over the problem, the more unanswerable did
it appear, and yet I could not get the matter out of my thoughts. The lonely, isolated Hall, and the strange, impending catastrophe which
hung over its inmates, appealed forcibly to my imagination. All that
evening, and late into the night, I sat moodily by the fire, pondering
over what I had heard, and revolving in my mind the various incidents
which might furnish me with some clue to the mystery.
