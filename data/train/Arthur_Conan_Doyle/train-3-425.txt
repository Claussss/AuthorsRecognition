"It will find with others of the series a permanent place in all
military libraries as a reliable work of reference for future students
of the war."--_Observer_        *       *       *       *       * _The Fifth Volume of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's
History of the War_ =THE BRITISH CAMPAIGN in FRANCE
and FLANDERS January to July,      1918= =With Maps, Plans and Diagrams= "The history shows no abatement in vigour and readableness, but rather
the opposite, and a final volume describing the great counter-attack of
the Allies, leading to their final victory, will bring to a close a
series which, on its own lines, is unsurpassable."--_Scotsman_
