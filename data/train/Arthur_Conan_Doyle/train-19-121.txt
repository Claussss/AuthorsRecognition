He was struck by my story.  That was evident.  "Yes, yes, she watched
me out of the room," he muttered.  "She is capable of it.  But is it
possible that she has really reduced you to this?  What do you intend
to do?" "To stop it!" I cried.  "I am perfectly desperate; I shall give her
fair warning to-day, and the next time will be the last." "Do nothing rash," said he. "Rash!" I cried.  "The only rash thing is that I should postpone it
another hour."  With that I rushed to my room, and here I am on the eve
of what may be the great crisis of my life.  I shall start at once.  I
have gained one thing to-day, for I have made one man, at least,
realize the truth of this monstrous experience of mine.  And, if the
worst should happen, this diary remains as a proof of the goad that has
driven me.
