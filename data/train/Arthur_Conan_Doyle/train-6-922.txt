Anxious to secure his plunder, and conscious that the levies of France
were far superior in number to his own force, the Prince redoubled his
attempts to escape; but his horses were exhausted and his starving men
were hardly to be kept in order. A few more days would unfit them
for battle. Therefore, when he found near the village of Maupertuis a
position in which a small force might have a chance to hold its own, he
gave up the attempt to outmarch his pursuers, and he turned at bay, like
a hunted boar, all tusks and eyes of flame.
