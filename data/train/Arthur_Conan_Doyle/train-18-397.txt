I could see that the Hillmen were taking heart, and that some of
my Sepoys were flinching, as if they did not relish this new enemy.
Clearly, I must act promptly if I wished to complete our success. I dashed forward at the head of the white artillerymen who had stuck to
me. The old fellow rushed at us with his arms out as if to stop us, but
it was not time to stick at trifles, so I passed my sword through his
body at the same moment that one of the gunners brought his carbine down
upon his head. He dropped instantly, and the Hillmen, at the sight of
his fall, set up the most unearthly howl of horror and consternation.
