“There spoke your father's spirit!” cried the King. “By the rood! Nigel,
I like you full well. Let the matter bide in my hands. But I marvel much
that Sir Aymery the Lombard hath not come to us yet from Windsor.” From the moment of his arrival at Tilford, again and again King Edward
had asked most eagerly whether Sir Aymery had come, and whether there
was any news of him, so that the courtiers glanced at each other in
wonder. For Aymery was known to all of them as a famous mercenary of
Italy, lately appointed Governor of Calais, and this sudden and urgent
summons from the King might well mean some renewal of the war with
France, which was the dearest wish of every soldier. Twice the King had
stopped his meal and sat with sidelong head; his wine-cup in his hand,
listening attentively when some sound like the clatter of hoofs was
heard from outside; but the third time there could be no mistake. The
tramp and jingle of the horses broke loud upon the ear, and ended in
hoarse voices calling out of the darkness, which were answered by the
archers posted as sentries without the door.
