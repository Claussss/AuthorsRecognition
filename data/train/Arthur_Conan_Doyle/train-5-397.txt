Smith stepped over to the table and looked down with a professional eye
at the black and twisted form in front of him.  The features, though
horribly discoloured, were perfect, and two little nut-like eyes still
lurked in the depths of the black, hollow sockets.  The blotched skin
was drawn tightly from bone to bone, and a tangled wrap of black coarse
hair fell over the ears.  Two thin teeth, like those of a rat, overlay
the shrivelled lower lip.  In its crouching position, with bent joints
and craned head, there was a suggestion of energy about the horrid
thing which made Smith's gorge rise.  The gaunt ribs, with their
parchment-like covering, were exposed, and the sunken, leaden-hued
abdomen, with the long slit where the embalmer had left his mark; but
the lower limbs were wrapt round with coarse yellow bandages.  A number
of little clove-like pieces of myrrh and of cassia were sprinkled over
the body, and lay scattered on the inside of the case.
