“If we can do nothing until the morning,” I said, “you have time to tell
us all that has occurred.” “I will do so,” he answered, rising and holding his shaking hands to the
fire. “You know already that we have had reason for some time--for many
years in fact--to fear that a terrible retribution was hanging over my
father's head for a certain action of his early life. In this action he
was associated with the man known as Corporal Rufus Smith, so that the
fact of the latter finding his way to my father was a warning to us that
the time had come, and that this 5th of October--the anniversary of the
misdeed--would be the day of its atonement. I told you of our fears
in my letter, and, if I am not mistaken, my father also had some
conversation with you, John, upon the subject. When I saw yesterday
morning that he had hunted out the old uniform which he had always
retained since he wore it in the Afghan war, I was sure that the end was
at hand, and that our forebodings would be realised.
