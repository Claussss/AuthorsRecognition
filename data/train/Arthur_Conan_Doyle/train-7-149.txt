danger signal, and discharged his rifle in the air. The echo of the
crack had hardly died away before they were all in their saddles, Arabs
and negroes. Another instant, and the camels were on their feet and
moving slowly towards the point of alarm. Several armed men surrounded
the prisoners, slipping cartridges into their Remingtons as a hint to
them to remain still.
