“I will give you more than hopes, Nigel. I will put you where you can
dip both arms to the elbow into danger and honor, where peril will sleep
with you at night and rise with you in the morning and the very air you
breathe be laden with it. Are you ready for that, young sir?” “I can but pray, fair lord, that my spirit will rise to it.” Chandos smiled his approval and laid his thin brown hand on the youth's
shoulder. “Good!” said he. “It is the mute hound which bites the
hardest. The babbler is ever the hang-back. Bide with me here, Nigel,
and walk upon the ramparts. Archer, do you lead the horses to the 'Sign
of the Broom Pod' in the high street, and tell my varlets to see them
aboard the cog Thomas before nightfall. We sail at the second hour after
curfew. Come hither, Nigel, to the crest of the corner turret, for from
it I will show you what you have never seen.”
