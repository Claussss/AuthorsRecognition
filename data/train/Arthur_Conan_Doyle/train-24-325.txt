“Pasques Dieu! but you have nicked it,” cried Aylward. “It was indeed
about a woman; and the quarrel must go forward, for I am still of the
same mind as before.” “What of the woman, then?” asked Simon. “May the murrain strike me if I
can call to mind aught about her.” “It was La Blanche Rose, maid at the sign of the 'Trois Corbeaux' at
Limoges. Bless her pretty heart! Why, mon gar., I loved her.” “So did a many,” quoth Simon. “I call her to mind now. On the very day
that we fought over the little hussy, she went off with Evan ap Price,
a long-legged Welsh dagsman. They have a hostel of their own now,
somewhere on the banks of the Garonne, where the landlord drinks so much
of the liquor that there is little left for the customers.”
