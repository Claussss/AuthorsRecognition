“I pray you to rest, fair sir,” said Aylward anxiously. “The King's own
leech saw you this morning, and he said that if the bandage was torn
from your head you would surely die.” “Nay, good archer, I will not move. But tell me what befell upon the
boat?” “There is little to tell, fair sir. Had this Ferret not been his own
squire and taken so long a time to don his harness it is likely that
they would have had the better of us. He did not reach the battle till
his comrades were on their backs. Him we took to the Marie Rose, because
he was your man. The others were of no worth, so we threw them into the
sea.”
