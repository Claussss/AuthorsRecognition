is slain, and there is nought left for us.” “On the contrary,” quoth Sir Nigel, “there is much left to us, for there
is a very honorable contention before us, and a fair lady for whom to
give our lives. There are many ways in which a man might die, but none
better than this.” “You can tell us, Godfrey,” said Du Guesclin to the French squire: “how
came these men into the castle, and what succors can we count upon? By
St. Ives! if we come not quickly to some counsel we shall be burned like
young rooks in a nest.”
