As Robert McIntyre emerged from the balmy aromatic atmosphere of the
great house, into the harsh, raw, biting air of an English winter
evening, he felt as though he had been away for a long visit in some
foreign country. Time is measured by impressions, and so vivid and novel
had been his feelings, that weeks and weeks might have elapsed since his
chat with the smoke-grimed stranger in the road. He walked along with
his head in a whirl, his whole mind possessed and intoxicated by the one
idea of the boundless wealth and the immense power of this extraordinary
stranger. Small and sordid and mean seemed his own Elmdene as he
approached it, and he passed over its threshold full of restless
discontent against himself and his surroundings.
