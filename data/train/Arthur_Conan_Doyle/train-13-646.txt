XI. The Naval Treaty       The July which immediately succeeded my marriage was made
      memorable by three cases of interest, in which I had the
      privilege of being associated with Sherlock Holmes and of
      studying his methods. I find them recorded in my notes under the
      headings of “The Adventure of the Second Stain,” “The Adventure
      of the Naval Treaty,” and “The Adventure of the Tired Captain.”
      The first of these, however, deals with interest of such
      importance and implicates so many of the first families in the
      kingdom that for many years it will be impossible to make it
      public. No case, however, in which Holmes was engaged has ever
      illustrated the value of his analytical methods so clearly or has
      impressed those who were associated with him so deeply. I still
      retain an almost verbatim report of the interview in which he
      demonstrated the true facts of the case to Monsieur Dubuque of
      the Paris police, and Fritz von Waldbaum, the well-known
      specialist of Dantzig, both of whom had wasted their energies
      upon what proved to be side-issues. The new century will have
      come, however, before the story can be safely told. Meanwhile I
      pass on to the second on my list, which promised also at one time
      to be of national importance, and was marked by several incidents
      which give it a quite unique character.
