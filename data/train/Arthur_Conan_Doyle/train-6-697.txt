The whole of France was feeling the effects of that war with England
which had already lasted some ten years, but no Province was in so
dreadful a condition as this unhappy land of Brittany. In Normandy or
Picardy the inroads of the English were periodical with intervals of
rest between; but Brittany was torn asunder by constant civil war apart
from the grapple of the two great combatants, so that there was no
surcease of her sufferings. The struggle had begun in 1341 through the
rival claims of Montfort and of Blois to the vacant dukedom. England had
taken the part of Montfort, France that of Blois. Neither faction was
strong enough to destroy the other, and so after ten years of continual
fighting, history recorded a long ineffectual list of surprises and
ambushes, of raids and skirmishes, of towns taken and retaken, of
alternate victory and defeat, in which neither party could claim
a supremacy. It mattered nothing that Montfort and Blois had both
disappeared from the scene, the one dead and the other taken by the
English. Their wives caught up the swords which had dropped from the
hands of their lords, and the long struggle went on even more savagely
than before.
