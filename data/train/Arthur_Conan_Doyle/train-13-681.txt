      opening the door ourselves, we allowed the girl to do so. We
      heard her say, ‘Mother, there are two men in the house waiting to
      see you,’ and an instant afterwards we heard the patter of feet
      rushing down the passage. Forbes flung open the door, and we both
      ran into the back room or kitchen, but the woman had got there

      recognising me, an expression of absolute astonishment came over
      her face.
