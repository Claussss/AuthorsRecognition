gallant man shot down like a bull at the end of a baiting. Five
against one is long odds; but two against four is better, and by my
finger-bones! Squire Nigel and I leave this room together, be it on our

his fellows gave a further chill to the lukewarm ardor of the attack.

from Woolmer Forest to the Weald as the quickest, surest archer that
ever dropped a running deer at tenscore paces.
