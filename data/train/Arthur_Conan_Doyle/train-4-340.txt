‘As to what you proposed, of serving us as a valet,’ said I, ‘it is not
to be thought of. We are, in spite of my friend’s waggishness, but two
plain blunt countrymen, and have no more need of a valet than one of
those poets which you have spoken of. On the other hand, if you should
care to attach yourself to our party, we shall take you where you
will see service which shall be more to your taste than the curling of
periwigs or the brushing of eyebrows.’
