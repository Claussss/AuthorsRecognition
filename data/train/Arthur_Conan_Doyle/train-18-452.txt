As to poor Mrs. Heatherstone, neither medical attention nor change of
air can ever have a permanent effect upon her. Slowly and surely, but
very placidly, she has declined in health and strength, until it is
evident that in a very few weeks at the most she will have rejoined her
husband and restored to him the one thing which he must have grudged to
leave behind. The Laird of Branksome came home from Italy restored in health, with the
result that we were compelled to return once more to Edinburgh.
