      Where is he, then?”       “He is here.”       “Here! Where?”       “In my company at the present moment.”       The Colonel flushed angrily. “I quite recognise that I am under
      obligations to you, Mr. Holmes,” said he, “but I must regard what
      you have just said as either a very bad joke or an insult.”
