pistols and very carefully reloading them. ‘As to who I am, it is a

horse by four of his rogues. Mark their faces, so dusky and sun-dried
even in death. These men have learned warfare fighting against the
heathen in Africa, and now they practise on poor harmless English folk
the devil’s tricks which they have picked up amongst the savages. The
Lord help Monmouth’s men should they be beaten! These vermin are more to
be feared than hangman’s cord or headsman’s axe.’
