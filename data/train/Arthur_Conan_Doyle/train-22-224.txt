“That's the past, Mr. Douglas,” said Sherlock Holmes quietly. “What we
desire now is to hear your story of the present.” “You'll have it, sir,” said Douglas. “May I smoke as I talk? Well, thank
you, Mr. Holmes. You're a smoker yourself, if I remember right, and
you'll guess what it is to be sitting for two days with tobacco in your
pocket and afraid that the smell will give you away.” He leaned against
the mantelpiece and sucked at the cigar which Holmes had handed him.
“I've heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I never guessed that I should meet you.
But before you are through with that,” he nodded at my papers, “you will
say I've brought you something fresh.”
