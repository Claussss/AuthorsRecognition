The Colonel had been looking about him during the long exhortation of
the Moolah, and he had observed that the Dervishes were cleaning their
guns, counting their cartridges, and making all the preparations of men
who expected that they might soon be called upon to fight. The two Emirs
were conferring together with grave faces, and the leader of the patrol
pointed, as he spoke to them, in the direction of Egypt. It was evident
that there was at least a chance of a rescue if they could only keep
things going for a few more hours. The camels were not recovered yet
from their long march, and the pursuers, if they were indeed close
behind, were almost certain to overtake them.
