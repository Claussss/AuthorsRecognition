‘What manner of man is the Duke?’ I asked. ‘Hot and hasty, like all of his blood. Yet when he hath time to think,
and hath cooled down, he is just in the main. Your horse hath been in
the water this morning, vriend.’ ‘Yes,’ said I shortly, ‘he hath had a bath.’ ‘I am going to his Grace on the business of a horse,’ quoth my
companion. ‘His officers have pressed my piebald four-year-old, and
taken it without a “With your leave,” or “By your leave,” for the use of
the King. I would have them know that there is something higher than
the Duke, or even than the King. There is the English law, which will
preserve a man’s goods and his chattels. I would do aught in reason for
King James’s service, but my piebald four-year-old is too much.’
