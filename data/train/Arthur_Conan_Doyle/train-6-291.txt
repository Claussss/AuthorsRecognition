“Let him out!” said the King, with his hand to his side. “I pray you to
unlace him and let him out! I have shared in many a spear-running, but
never have I been nearer falling from my horse than as I watched this
one. I feared the fall had struck him senseless, since he lay so still.” Nigel had indeed lain with all the breath shaken from his body, and
as he was unaware that his helmet had been carried off, he had not
understood either the alarm or the amusement that he had caused. Now
freed from the great hauberk in which he had been shut like a pea in a
pod, he stood blinking in the light, blushing deeply with shame that
the shifts to which his poverty had reduced him should be exposed to all
these laughing courtiers. It was the King who brought him comfort.
