Robert gave a cry of dismay. There was the alchemist standing in the
doorway, pale and silent, looking from one to the other of them with his
searching eyes. “I must apologise,” he said coldly. “I did not mean to listen to your
words. I could not help it. But I have heard them. As to you, Mr.
McIntyre, I believe that you speak from your own bad heart. I will not
let myself be moved by your words. In Robert I have a true friend. Laura
also loves me for my own sake. You cannot shake my faith in them. But
with you, Mr. McIntyre, I have nothing in common; and it is as well,
perhaps, that we should both recognise the fact.”
