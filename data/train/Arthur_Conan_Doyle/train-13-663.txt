      â€œWhen I came to examine the treaty I saw at once that it was of
      such importance that my uncle had been guilty of no exaggeration

      Alliance, and fore-shadowed the policy which this country would
      pursue in the event of the French fleet gaining a complete
      ascendancy over that of Italy in the Mediterranean. The questions
      treated in it were purely naval. At the end were the signatures
      of the high dignitaries who had signed it. I glanced my eyes over
      it, and then settled down to my task of copying.
