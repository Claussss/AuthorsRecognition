  "A cockney in a rural village was stared at as much as if he
  had intruded into a kraal of Hottentots. On the other hand,
  when the lord of a Lincolnshire or Shropshire manor appeared
  in Fleet Street, he was as easily distinguished from the
  resident population as a Turk or a Lascar. His dress, his gait,
  his accent, the manner in which he gazed at the shops, stumbled
  into gutters, ran against the porters, and stood under the
  waterspouts, marked him out as an excellent subject for the
  operations of swindlers and banterers. Bullies jostled him into
  the kennel, Hackney coachmen splashed him from head to foot,
  thieves explored with perfect security the huge pockets of his
  horseman's coat, while he stood entranced by the splendour of
  the Lord Mayor's Show. Money-droppers, sore from the cart's
  tail, introduced themselves to him, and appeared to him the
  most honest friendly gentlemen that he had ever seen. Painted
  women, the refuse of Lewkner Lane and Whetstone Park, passed
  themselves on him for countesses and maids of honour. If he
  asked his way to St. James', his informants sent him to Mile
  End. If he went into a shop, he was instantly discerned to be
  a fit purchaser of everything that nobody else would buy, of
  second-hand embroidery, copper rings, and watches that would
  not go. If he rambled into any fashionable coffee-house, he
  became a mark for the insolent derision of fops, and the grave
  waggery of Templars. Enraged and mortified, he soon returned
  to his mansion, and there, in the homage of his tenants and
  the conversation of his boon companions, found consolation for
  the vexations and humiliations which he had undergone. There
  he was once more a great man, and saw nothing above himself
  except when at the assizes he took his seat on the bench near
  the Judge, or when at the muster of the militia he saluted the
  Lord Lieutenant."
