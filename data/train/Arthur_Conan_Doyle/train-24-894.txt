        What of the men?
           The men were bred in England,
        The bowmen, the yeomen,
           The lads of the dale and fell,
        Here's to you and to you,
        To the hearts that are true,
           And the land where the true hearts dwell. “They sing very joyfully,” said Du Guesclin, “as though they were going
to a festival.” “It is their wont when there is work to be done.”
