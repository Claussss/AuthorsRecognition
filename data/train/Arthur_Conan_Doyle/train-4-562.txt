When the last soldier had passed through the Shuttern Gate, Monmouth and
his leaders rode slowly in, the Mayor walking by the King’s charger.
As we saluted they all faced round to us, and I saw a quick flush of
surprise and pleasure come over Monmouth’s pale face as he noted our
close lines and soldierly bearing. ‘By my faith, gentlemen,’ he said, glancing round at his staff, ‘our
worthy friend the Mayor must have inherited Cadmus’s dragon teeth. Where
raised ye this pretty crop, Sir Stephen? How came ye to bring them
to such perfection too, even, I declare, to the hair powder of the
grenadiers?’
