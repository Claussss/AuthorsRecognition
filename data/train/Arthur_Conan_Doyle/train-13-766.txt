XII. The Final Problem       It is with a heavy heart that I take up my pen to write these the
      last words in which I shall ever record the singular gifts by
      which my friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes was distinguished. In an
      incoherent and, as I deeply feel, an entirely inadequate fashion,
      I have endeavoured to give some account of my strange experiences
      in his company from the chance which first brought us together at
      the period of the “Study in Scarlet,” up to the time of his
      interference in the matter of the “Naval Treaty”—an interference
      which had the unquestionable effect of preventing a serious
      international complication. It was my intention to have stopped
      there, and to have said nothing of that event which has created a
      void in my life which the lapse of two years has done little to
      fill. My hand has been forced, however, by the recent letters in
      which Colonel James Moriarty defends the memory of his brother,
      and I have no choice but to lay the facts before the public
      exactly as they occurred. I alone know the absolute truth of the
      matter, and I am satisfied that the time has come when no good
      purpose is to be served by its suppression. As far as I know,
      there have been only three accounts in the public press: that in
      the _Journal de Genève_ on May 6th, 1891, the Reuter’s despatch
      in the English papers on May 7th, and finally the recent letter
      to which I have alluded. Of these the first and second were
      extremely condensed, while the last is, as I shall now show, an
      absolute perversion of the facts. It lies with me to tell for the
      first time what really took place between Professor Moriarty and
      Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
