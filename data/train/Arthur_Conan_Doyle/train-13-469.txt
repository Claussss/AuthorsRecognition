      and having entered the room and seen the dressing-gown hanging up
      behind the door, I contrived, by upsetting a table, to engage

      pockets. I had hardly got the paper, however—which was, as I had

      your prompt and friendly aid. As it is, I feel that young man’s
      grip on my throat now, and the father has twisted my wrist round
      in the effort to get the paper out of my hand. They saw that I
      must know all about it, you see, and the sudden change from
      absolute security to complete despair made them perfectly
      desperate.
