But fair as was the view of their lost friends, and wondrous the
appearance of the Spanish ships, it was not on those that the eyes of
the men of the Basilisk were chiefly bent. A greater sight lay before
them--a sight which brought them clustering to the forecastle with eager
eyes and pointing fingers. The English fleet was coming forth from the
Winchelsea Coast. Already before the fog lifted a fast galleass had
brought the news down Channel that the Spanish were on the sea, and the
King's fleet was under way. Now their long array of sails, gay with
the coats and colors of the towns which had furnished them, lay bright
against the Kentish coast from Dungeness Point to Rye. Nine and twenty
ships were there from Southampton, Shoreham, Winchelsea, Hastings, Rye,
Hythe, Romney, Folkestone, Deal, Dover and Sandwich. With their great
sails slued round to catch the wind they ran out, whilst the Spanish,
like the gallant foes that they have ever been, turned their heads
landward to meet them. With flaunting banners and painted sails, blaring
trumpets and clashing cymbals, the two glittering fleets, dipping and
rising on the long Channel swell, drew slowly together.
