“A rouse! A rouse!” cried one rough looking fellow in a tattered jerkin.
“One more round of mead or ale and the score to the last comer.” “'Tis the law of the 'Pied Merlin,'” shouted another. “Ho there, Dame
Eliza! Here is fresh custom come to the house, and not a drain for the
company.” “I will take your orders, gentles; I will assuredly take your orders,”
 the landlady answered, bustling in with her hands full of leathern
drinking-cups. “What is it that you drink, then? Beer for the lads of
the forest, mead for the gleeman, strong waters for the tinker, and wine
for the rest. It is an old custom of the house, young sir. It has been
the use at the 'Pied Merlin' this many a year back that the company
should drink to the health of the last comer. Is it your pleasure to
humor it?”
