"Oh, that's all right."  The doctor concealed his disappointment under
an affectation of facetiousness.  "You don't look as if you troubled
them much.  I don't know what we should do if every one were as robust.
I shall call at the company's offices and pay this small amount." "If you could make it convenient, sir, now that I am here, it would
save trouble----" "Oh, certainly!"  These eternal little sordid money troubles were more
trying to the doctor than plain living or scanty food.  He took out his
purse and slid the contents on to the table.  There were two
half-crowns and some pennies.  In his drawer he had ten golden
sovereigns.  But those were his rent.  If he once broke in upon them he
was lost.  He would starve first.
