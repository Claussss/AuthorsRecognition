      “Why, Mr. Holmes, the crime was only committed at three this
      morning. How could you hear of it in London and get to the spot
      as soon as I?”       “I anticipated it. I came in the hope of preventing it.”       “Then you must have important evidence, of which we are ignorant,
      for they were said to be a most united couple.”       “I have only the evidence of the dancing men,” said Holmes. “I
      will explain the matter to you later. Meanwhile, since it is too
      late to prevent this tragedy, I am very anxious that I should use
      the knowledge which I possess in order to insure that justice be
      done. Will you associate me in your investigation, or will you
      prefer that I should act independently?”
