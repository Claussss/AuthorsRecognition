The Breton champions had not yet arrived, so the English tethered their
horses at one side of the ground, and then gathered round their leader.
Every man had his shield slung round his neck, and had cut his spear to
the length of five feet so that it might be more manageable for fighting
on foot. Besides the spear a sword or a battle-ax hung at the side of
each. They were clad from head to foot in armor, with devices upon
the crests and surcoats to distinguish them from their antagonists.
At present their visors were still up and they chatted gayly with each
other.
