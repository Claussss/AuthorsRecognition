Once for an instant I opened the lattice window, but a gust of wind and
rain came blustering through, bearing with it a great sheet of seaweed,
which flapped down upon the table. It was all I could do to close it
again with a thrust of my shoulder in the face of the blast. My sister and father had retired to their rooms, but my thoughts
were too active for sleep, so I continued to sit and to smoke by the
smouldering fire.
