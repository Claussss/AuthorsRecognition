Sherlock Holmes was rubbing his hands and chuckling as he added this
bizarre incident to his collection of strange episodes. “Your experience is, so far as I know, perfectly unique,” said he. “May
I ask, sir, what you did then?” “I was furious. My first idea was that I had been the victim of some
absurd practical joke. I packed my things, banged the hall door behind
me, and set off for Esher, with my bag in my hand. I called at Allan
Brothers’, the chief land agents in the village, and found that it was
from this firm that the villa had been rented. It struck me that the
whole proceeding could hardly be for the purpose of making a fool of
me, and that the main object must be to get out of the rent. It is late
in March, so quarter-day is at hand. But this theory would not work.
The agent was obliged to me for my warning, but told me that the rent
had been paid in advance. Then I made my way to town and called at the
Spanish embassy. The man was unknown there. After this I went to see
Melville, at whose house I had first met Garcia, but I found that he
really knew rather less about him than I did. Finally when I got your
reply to my wire I came out to you, since I gather that you are a
person who gives advice in difficult cases. But now, Mr. Inspector, I
understand, from what you said when you entered the room, that you can
carry the story on, and that some tragedy had occurred. I can assure
you that every word I have said is the truth, and that, outside of what
I have told you, I know absolutely nothing about the fate of this man.
My only desire is to help the law in every possible way.”
