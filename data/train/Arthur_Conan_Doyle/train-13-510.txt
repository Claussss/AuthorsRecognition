      It was midday when we found ourselves at the scene of the
      tragedy, and, under my companionâ€™s guidance, we made our way at
      once to Hudson Street. In spite of his capacity for concealing
      his emotions, I could easily see that Holmes was in a state of
      suppressed excitement, while I was myself tingling with that
      half-sporting, half-intellectual pleasure which I invariably
      experienced when I associated myself with him in his
      investigations.
