  "Now there are fine tales in the volumes of the Magi--in the
  iron-bound melancholy volumes of the Magi. Therein, I say,
  are glorious histories of the heaven and of the earth, and
  of the mighty sea--and of the genius that overruled the sea,
  and the earth, and the lofty heaven. There were much lore,
  too, in the sayings which were said by the Sybils, and holy,
  holy things were heard of old by the dim leaves which trembled
  round Dodona, but as Allah liveth, that fable which the Demon
  told me as he sat by my side in the shadow of the tomb, I
  hold to be the most wonderful of all." Or this sentence:
  "And then did we, the seven, start from our seats in horror,
  and stand trembling and aghast, for the tones in the voice
  of the shadow were not the tones of any one being, but of
  a multitude of beings, and, varying in their cadences from
  syllable to syllable, fell duskily upon our ears in the
  well-remembered and familiar accents of many thousand departed
  friends."
