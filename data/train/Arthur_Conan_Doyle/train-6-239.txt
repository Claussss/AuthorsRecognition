Many weighty things were on the mind of Edward the King. There was truce
for the moment with France, but it was a truce broken by many small
deeds of arms, raids, surprises and ambushes upon either side, and it
was certain that it would soon dissolve again into open war. Money must
be raised, and it was no light matter to raise it, now that the Commons
had once already voted the tenth lamb and the tenth sheaf. Besides, the
Black Death had ruined the country, the arable land was all turned
to pasture, the laborer, laughing at statutes, would not work under
fourpence a day, and all society was chaos. In addition, the Scotch
were growling over the border, there was the perennial trouble in
half-conquered Ireland, and his allies abroad in Flanders and in Brabant
were clamoring for the arrears of their subsidies.
