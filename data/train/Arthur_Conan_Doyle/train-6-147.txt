“I am the Abbot of Waverley, fair son,” said the prelate. “If your
message deal with a public matter it may be fitly repeated in the
chapter-house; if not I will give you audience in my own chamber; for
it is clear to me that you are a gentle man of blood and coat-armor who
would not lightly break in upon the business of our court--a business
which, as you have remarked, is little welcome to men of peace like
myself and the brethren of the rule of Saint Bernard.”
