With a kindling eye Chandos looked across at the proud ensigns of
Normandy, or Burgundy, of Auvergne, of Champagne, of Vermandois, and
of Berry, flaunting and gleaming in the rays of the sinking sun. Riding
slowly down the line he marked with attentive gaze the camp of the
crossbowmen, the muster of the German mercenaries, the numbers of the
foot-soldiers, the arms of every proud vassal or vavasor which might
give some guide as to the power of each division. From wing to wing and
round the flanks he went, keeping ever within crossbow-shot of the
army, and then at last having noted all things in his mind he turned his
horse's head and rode slowly back, heavy with thought, to the English
lines.
