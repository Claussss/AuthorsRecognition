“Dear and sweet lord,” she cried, “I trust they have done you no hurt. I
waited by the old ash, and my heart sank when you came not.” “I have been taken at last, wife.” “Oh, cursed, cursed day! Let him go, kind, gentle sirs; do not take him
from me!” “They will speak for me at Guildford,” said the “Wild Man.” “They have
sworn it. But hand them first the bag that you have taken.” She drew it out from under her loose cloak. “Here it is, gentle sir.
Indeed it went to my heart to take it, for you had mercy upon me in my
trouble. But now I am, as you see, in real and very sore distress. Will
you not have mercy now? Take ruth on us, fair sir! On my knees I beg it
of you, most gentle and kindly Squire!”
