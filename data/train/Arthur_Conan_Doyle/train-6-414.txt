“Oh, Mary, I thank the Virgin that you have come! I thank the Virgin
that it is not too late! What did he say? He said that he was a de la
Fosse and that he would not be married at the sword-point. My heart went
out to him when he said it. But I, am I not a Buttesthorn, and shall it
be said that I would marry a man who could be led to the altar with a
knife at his throat? No, no, I see him as he is! I know him now, the
mean spirit, the lying tongue! Can I not read in his eyes that he has
indeed deceived me, that he would have left me as you say that he has
left others? Take me home, Mary, my sister, for you have plucked me back
this night from the very mouth of Hell!”
