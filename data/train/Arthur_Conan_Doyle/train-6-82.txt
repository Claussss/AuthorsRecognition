But if the actual fittings of the room would have appeared scanty to one
who had lived in a more luxurious age, he would have been surprised on
looking up to see the multitude of objects which were suspended above
his head. Over the fireplace were the coats-of-arms of a number
of houses allied by blood or by marriage to the Lorings. The two
cresset-lights which flared upon each side gleamed upon the blue lion of
the Percies, the red birds of de Valence, the black engrailed cross of
de Mohun, the silver star of de Vere, and the ruddy bars of FitzAlan,
all grouped round the famous red roses on the silver shield which the
Lorings had borne to glory upon many a bloody field. Then from side to
side the room was spanned by heavy oaken beams from which a great number
of objects were hanging. There were mail-shirts of obsolete pattern,
several shields, one or two rusted and battered helmets, bowstaves,
lances, otter-spears, harness, fishing-rods, and other implements of war
or of the chase, while higher still amid the black shadows of the peaked
roof could be seen rows of hams, flitches of bacon, salted geese, and
those other forms of preserved meat which played so great a part in the
housekeeping of the Middle Ages.
