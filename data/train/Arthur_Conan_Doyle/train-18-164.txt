The mair I thocht o't the mair seemple it appeared, and I made up my
mind tae put the idea intae instant execution. When the nicht cam roond I tauld the women-folk that I was bad wi' the
jawache, and would gang airly tae my room. I kenned fine when ance I got
there that there was na chance o' ony ane disturbin' me, so I waited a
wee while, and then when a' was quiet, I slippit aff my boots and ran
doon the ither stair until I cam tae the heap o' auld clothes, and there
I lay doon wi' ane e'e peepin' through a kink and a' the rest covered up
wi' a great, ragged cairpet.
