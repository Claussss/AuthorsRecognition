      “I did, sir, and at the sight of me he looked as I have never
      seen a man look before, and over he went with his head on the
      fender. But he was dead before he fell. I read death on his face
      as plain as I can read that text over the fire. The bare sight of
      me was like a bullet through his guilty heart.”       “And then?”       “Then Nancy fainted, and I caught up the key of the door from her
      hand, intending to unlock it and get help. But as I was doing it
      it seemed to me better to leave it alone and get away, for the
      thing might look black against me, and any way my secret would be
      out if I were taken. In my haste I thrust the key into my pocket,
      and dropped my stick while I was chasing Teddy, who had run up
      the curtain. When I got him into his box, from which he had
      slipped, I was off as fast as I could run.”
