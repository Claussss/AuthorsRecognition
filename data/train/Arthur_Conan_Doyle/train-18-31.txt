“I do wonder whether he has a wife and a family,” said my sister. “Poor
souls, how lonely they will be! Why, excepting ourselves, there is not a
family that they could speak to for seven miles and more.” “General Heatherstone is a very distinguished soldier,” remarked my
father. “Why, papa, however came you to know anything about him?” “Ah, my dears,” said my father, smiling at us over his coffee-cup, “you
were laughing at my library just now, but you see it may be very useful
at times.” As he spoke he took a red-covered volume from a shelf and
turned over the pages. “This is an Indian Army List of three
years back,” he explained, “and here is the very gentleman we
want-'Heatherstone, J. B., Commander of the Bath,' my dears, and 'V.C.',
think of that, 'V.C.'--'formerly colonel in the Indian Infantry, 41st
Bengal Foot, but now retired with the rank of major-general.' In this
other column is a record of his services--'capture of Ghuznee and
defence of Jellalabad, Sobraon 1848, Indian Mutiny and reduction of
Oudh. Five times mentioned in dispatches.' I think, my dears, that we
have cause to be proud of our new neighbour.”
