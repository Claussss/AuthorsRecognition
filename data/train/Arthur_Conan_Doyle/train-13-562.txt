      Sherlock Holmes’s prophecy was soon fulfilled, and in a dramatic
      fashion. At half-past seven next morning, in the first glimmer of
      daylight, I found him standing by my bedside in his
      dressing-gown.       “There’s a brougham waiting for us, Watson,” said he.       “What’s the matter, then?”       “The Brook Street business.”       “Any fresh news?”       “Tragic, but ambiguous,” said he, pulling up the blind. “Look at
      this—a sheet from a note-book, with ‘For God’s sake come at
      once—P.T.,’ scrawled upon it in pencil. Our friend, the doctor,
      was hard put to it when he wrote this. Come along, my dear
      fellow, for it’s an urgent call.”
