      Sherlock Holmes rubbed his hands with delight, and I stared with
      astonishment at our client.       “You may well look surprised, Dr. Watson; but it is this way,”
      said he: “When I was speaking to the other chap in London, at the
      time that he laughed at my not going to Mawson’s, I happened to
      notice that his tooth was stuffed in this very identical fashion.
      The glint of the gold in each case caught my eye, you see. When I
      put that with the voice and figure being the same, and only those
      things altered which might be changed by a razor or a wig, I
      could not doubt that it was the same man. Of course you expect
      two brothers to be alike, but not that they should have the same
      tooth stuffed in the same way. He bowed me out, and I found
      myself in the street, hardly knowing whether I was on my head or
      my heels. Back I went to my hotel, put my head in a basin of cold
      water, and tried to think it out. Why had he sent me from London
      to Birmingham? Why had he got there before me? And why had he
      written a letter from himself to himself? It was altogether too
      much for me, and I could make no sense of it. And then suddenly
      it struck me that what was dark to me might be very light to Mr.
      Sherlock Holmes. I had just time to get up to town by the night
      train to see him this morning, and to bring you both back with me
      to Birmingham.”
