“If you have determined to honour our neighbourhood by a short stay,”
 said I, “you will offend my father very much if you do not put up with
him. He represents the laird here, and it is the laird's privilege,
according to our Scottish custom, to entertain all strangers of repute
who visit this parish.” My sense of hospitality prompted me to deliver this invitation, though
I could feel the mate twitching at my sleeves as if to warn me that
the offer was, for some reason, an objectionable one. His fears were,
however, unnecessary, for the stranger signified by a shake of the head
that it was impossible for him to accept it.
