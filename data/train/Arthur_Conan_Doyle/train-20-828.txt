      “What time did you dine?”       “Half-past seven.”       “How long was it before you went to bed?”       “My wife had gone to the theatre. I waited up for her. It was
      half-past eleven before we went to our room.”       “Then for four hours the despatch-box had lain unguarded?”       “No one is ever permitted to enter that room save the house-maid
      in the morning, and my valet, or my wife’s maid, during the rest
      of the day. They are both trusty servants who have been with us
      for some time. Besides, neither of them could possibly have known
      that there was anything more valuable than the ordinary
      departmental papers in my despatch-box.”
