      I shall be brief, and yet exact, in the little which remains for
      me to tell. It is not a subject on which I would willingly dwell,
      and yet I am conscious that a duty devolves upon me to omit no
      detail.       It was on the 3rd of May that we reached the little village of
      Meiringen, where we put up at the Englischer Hof, then kept by
      Peter Steiler the elder. Our landlord was an intelligent man, and
      spoke excellent English, having served for three years as waiter
      at the Grosvenor Hotel in London. At his advice, on the afternoon
      of the 4th we set off together, with the intention of crossing
      the hills and spending the night at the hamlet of Rosenlaui. We
      had strict injunctions, however, on no account to pass the falls
      of Reichenbach, which are about half-way up the hill, without
      making a small d√©tour to see them.
