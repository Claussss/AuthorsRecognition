“You are my horse, Pommers,” Nigel whispered, and he laid his cheek
against the craning head. “I know you, Pommers, and you know me, and
with the help of Saint Paul we shall teach some other folk to know us
both. Now let us walk together as far as this moorland pond, for indeed
I wot not whether it is you or I who need the water most.” And so it was that some belated monks of Waverley passing homeward from
the outer farms saw a strange sight which they carried on with them so
that it reached that very night the ears both of sacrist and of Abbot.
For, as they passed through Tilford they had seen horse and man walking
side by side and head by head up the manor-house lane. And when they
had raised their lanterns on the pair it was none other than the young
Squire himself who was leading home, as a shepherd leads a lamb, the
fearsome yellow horse of Crooksbury.
