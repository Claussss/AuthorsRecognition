Sir Nigel. “Argent, a bend vert between cotises dancette gules.” “It is a northern coat. I have seen it in the train of the Percies. From
the shields, there is not one of these vessels which hath not knight or
baron aboard. I would mine eyes were better. How read you this upon the
left?” “Argent and azure, a barry wavy of six.”
