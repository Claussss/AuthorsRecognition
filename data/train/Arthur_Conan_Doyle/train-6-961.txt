A young knight, ruddy-bearded and tall, a red griffin upon his surcoat,
had appeared in the opening of the tent. His flushed face and disheveled
dress showed that he had come in haste. “Sire,” said he, “I am Robert
de Duras, of the household of the Cardinal de Perigord. I have told you
yesterday all that I have learned of the English camp. This morning I
was again admitted to it, and I have seen their wagons moving to the
rear. Sire, they are in flight for Bordeaux.”
