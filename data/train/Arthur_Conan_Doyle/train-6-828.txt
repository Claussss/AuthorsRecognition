A strange sight it was to see these twenty naked men crouching in a
half-circle round the fire with their trembling hands extended to the
blaze. Soon their tongues at least were thawed, and they poured out the
story of their troubles with many a prayer and ejaculation to the saints
for their safe delivery. No food had crossed their lips since they had
been taken. The Butcher had commanded them to join his garrison and to
shoot upon their comrades from the wall. When they refused he had set
aside three of them for execution.
