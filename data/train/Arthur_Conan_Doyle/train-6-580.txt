“My honored lord, what could I ask for better?” “Then have your harness ready, for we start within the week. Our path
by land is blocked by the French, and we go by sea. This night the King
gives a banquet ere he returns to England, and your place is behind my
chair. Be in my chamber that you may help me to dress, and so we will to
the hall together.” With satin and with samite, with velvet and with fur, the noble Chandos
was dressed for the King's feast, and Nigel too had donned his best silk
jupon, faced with the five scarlet roses, that he might wait upon him.
In the great hall of Calais Castle the tables were set, a high table for
the lords, a second one for the less distinguished knights, and a third
at which the squires might feast when their masters were seated.
