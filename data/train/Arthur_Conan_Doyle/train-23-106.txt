SPIRIT PHOTOGRAPHY 
On this subject I should recommend the reader to consult Coates'
"Photographing the Invisible," which states, in a thoughtful and
moderate way, the evidence for this most remarkable phase, and
illustrates it with many examples.  It is pointed out that here, as
always, fraud must be carefully guarded against, having been admitted
in the case of the French spirit photographer, Buguet.
