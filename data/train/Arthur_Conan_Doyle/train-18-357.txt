So at last I was to know the dark secret which had cast a shadow over
our lives. Here in my hands I held the solution of it. With eager fingers I broke the seals and undid the wrapper. A note and a
small bundle of discoloured paper lay within. I drew the lamp over to me
and opened the former. It was dated the preceding afternoon, and ran in
this way: MY DEAR WEST,-- I should have satisfied your very natural curiosity on the subject which
we have had occasion to talk of more than once, but I refrained for your
own sake. I knew by sad experience how unsettling and unnerving it is
to be for ever waiting for a catastrophe which you are convinced must
befall, and which you can neither avert nor accelerate.
