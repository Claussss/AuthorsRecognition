always kept it secret from me. My poor father is very excited at
present. Day and night he is in an agony of apprehension, but it will
soon be the fifth of October, and after that he will be at peace.” “How do you know that?” I asked in surprise. “By experience,” she answered gravely. “On the fifth of October these
fears of his come to a crisis. For years back he has been in the habit
of locking Mordaunt and myself up in our rooms on that date, so that we
have no idea what occurs, but we have always found that he has been
much relieved afterwards, and has continued to be comparatively in peace
until that day begins to draw round again.”
