April 28.  The suspension of my lectureship has had the effect also of
taking away her means of annoying me, and so I have enjoyed two blessed
days of peace.  After all, there is no reason to despair.  Sympathy
pours in to me from all sides, and every one agrees that it is my
devotion to science and the arduous nature of my researches which have
shaken my nervous system.  I have had the kindest message from the
council advising me to travel abroad, and expressing the confident hope
that I may be able to resume all my duties by the beginning of the
summer term.  Nothing could be more flattering than their allusions to
my career and to my services to the university.  It is only in
misfortune that one can test one's own popularity.  This creature may
weary of tormenting me, and then all may yet be well.  May God grant it!
