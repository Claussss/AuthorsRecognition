A wail of fear went up from the wreck and was echoed from the beach,
but by the blessing of Providence she kept afloat until we made our way
under her bowsprit and rescued every man of the crew. We had not got half-way upon our return, however, when another great
wave swept the shattered forecastle off the reef, and, extinguishing the
signal light, hid the wild denouement from our view. Our friends upon the shore were loud in congratulation and praise, nor
were they backward in welcoming and comforting the castaways. They were
thirteen in all, as cold and cowed a set of mortals as ever slipped
through Death's fingers, save, indeed, their captain, who was a hardy,
robust man, and who made light of the affair.
