I have said that scattered towers marked the villages which dotted this
part of Cornwall. The nearest of these was the hamlet of Tredannick
Wollas, where the cottages of a couple of hundred inhabitants clustered
round an ancient, moss-grown church. The vicar of the parish, Mr.
Roundhay, was something of an archæologist, and as such Holmes had made
his acquaintance. He was a middle-aged man, portly and affable, with a
considerable fund of local lore. At his invitation we had taken tea at
the vicarage and had come to know, also, Mr. Mortimer Tregennis, an
independent gentleman, who increased the clergyman’s scanty resources
by taking rooms in his large, straggling house. The vicar, being a
bachelor, was glad to come to such an arrangement, though he had little
in common with his lodger, who was a thin, dark, spectacled man, with a
stoop which gave the impression of actual, physical deformity. I
remember that during our short visit we found the vicar garrulous, but
his lodger strangely reticent, a sad-faced, introspective man, sitting
with averted eyes, brooding apparently upon his own affairs.
