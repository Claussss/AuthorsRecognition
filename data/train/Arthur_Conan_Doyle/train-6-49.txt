The horse drew off, glared with wonder and fury at this masterful man,
and then trotted round in a circle, with mane bristling, tail streaming
and ears on end, snorting in its rage and pain. The man, hardly deigning
to glance at his fell neighbor, passed on to the wounded forester,
raised him in his arms with a strength which could not have been
expected in so slight a body, and carried him, groaning, to the wall,
where a dozen hands were outstretched to help him over. Then, at his
leisure, the young man also climbed the wall, smiling back with cool
contempt at the yellow horse, which had come raging after him once more.
