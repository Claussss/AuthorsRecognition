      After the conversation which I have quoted about Barrymore, Sir
      Henry put on his hat and prepared to go out. As a matter of
      course I did the same.       “What, are _you_ coming, Watson?” he asked, looking at me in a
      curious way.       “That depends on whether you are going on the moor,” said I.       “Yes, I am.”       “Well, you know what my instructions are. I am sorry to intrude,
      but you heard how earnestly Holmes insisted that I should not
      leave you, and especially that you should not go alone upon the
      moor.”
