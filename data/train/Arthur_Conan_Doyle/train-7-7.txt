The other passengers may be dismissed more briefly. Some were
interesting, some neutral, and all amiable. Monsieur Fardet was a
good-natured but argumentative Frenchman, who held the most decided
views as to the deep machinations of Great Britain and the illegality
of her position in Egypt. Mr. Belmont was an iron-grey, sturdy Irishman,
famous as an astonishingly good long-range rifle-shot, who had carried
off nearly every prize which Wimbledon or Bisley had to offer. With him
was his wife, a very charming and refined woman, full of the pleasant
playfulness of her country. Mrs. Shiesinger was a middle-aged widow,
quiet and soothing, with her thoughts all taken up by her six-year-old
child, as a mother's thoughts are likely to be in a boat which has an
open rail for a bulwark. The Reverend John Stuart was a
Non-conformist minister from Birmingham,--either a Presbyterian or a
Congregationalist,--a man of immense stoutness, slow and torpid in his
ways, but blessed with a considerable fund of homely humour, which made
him, I am told, a very favourite preacher and an effective speaker from
advanced radical platforms.
