At the door of the chapter-house, while these fiery doings had been
afoot, there had assembled a mixed crowd of lay brothers, servants and
varlets who had watched the development of the drama with the interest
and delight with which men hail a sudden break in a dull routine.
Suddenly there was an agitation at the back of this group, then a swirl
in the center, and finally the front rank was violently thrust aside,
and through the gap there emerged a strange and whimsical figure, who
from the instant of his appearance dominated both chapter-house and
Abbey, monks, prelates and archers, as if he were their owner and their
master.
