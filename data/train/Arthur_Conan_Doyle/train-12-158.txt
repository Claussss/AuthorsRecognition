CHAPTER IX. A NEW DEPARTURE. 
Whatever good Mr. Raffles Haw's wealth did to the world, there could be
no doubt that there were cases where it did harm. The very contemplation
and thought of it had upon many a disturbing and mischievous effect.
Especially was this the case with the old gunmaker. From being merely
a querulous and grasping man, he had now become bitter, brooding, and
dangerous. Week by week, as he saw the tide of wealth flow as it were
through his very house without being able to divert the smallest rill to
nourish his own fortunes, he became more wolfish and more hungry-eyed.
He spoke less of his own wrongs, but he brooded more, and would stand
for hours on Tamfield Hill looking down at the great palace beneath, as
a thirst-stricken man might gaze at the desert mirage.
