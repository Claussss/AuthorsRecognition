“And pray, sir,” I asked, “how long would the whole work be when it was
finished?” “The abridged edition in the Imperial Library of Pekin,” said my father,
rubbing his hands together, “consists of 325 volumes of an average
weight of five pounds. Then the preface, which must embrace some
account of the Rig-veda, the Sama-veda, the Yagur-veda, and the
Atharva-veda, with the Brahmanas, could hardly be completed in less
than ten volumes. Now, if we apportion one volume to each year, there is
every prospect of the family coming to an end of its task about the date
2250, the twelfth generation completing the work, while the thirteenth
might occupy itself upon the index.”
