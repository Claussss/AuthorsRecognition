“Some traveler has indeed arrived, my liege,” said Nigel. “What is your
royal will?” “It can be but Aymery,” the King answered, “for it was only to him that
I left the message that he should follow me hither. Bid him come in, I
pray you, and make him very welcome at your board.” Nigel cast open the door, plucking a torch from its bracket as he did
so. Half a dozen men-at-arms sat on their horses outside, but one had
dismounted, a short, squat, swarthy man with a rat face and quick,
restless brown eyes which peered eagerly past Nigel into the red glare
of the well-lit hall.
