Let us for a moment examine the facts in this Crookes' episode.  A
small book exists which describes them, though it is not as accessible
as it should be.  In these wonderful experiments, which extended over
several years, Miss Florrie Cook, who was a young lady of from 16 to 18
years of age, was repeatedly confined in Prof. Crookes' study, the door
being locked on the inside.  Here she lay unconscious upon a couch.
The spectators assembled in the laboratory, which was separated by a
curtained opening from the study.  After a short interval, through this
opening there emerged a lady who was in all ways different from Miss
Cook.  She gave her earth name as Katie King, and she proclaimed
herself to be a materialised spirit, whose mission it was to carry the
knowledge of immortality to mortals.
