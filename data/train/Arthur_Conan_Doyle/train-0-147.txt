having with him when he followed Drebber. It was a stout oak cudgel.” “What is your theory, then?” “Well, my theory is that he followed Drebber as far as the Brixton Road.

which Drebber received a blow from the stick, in the pit of the stomach,
perhaps, which killed him without leaving any mark. The night was so

into the empty house. As to the candle, and the blood, and the writing
on the wall, and the ring, they may all be so many tricks to throw the
police on to the wrong scent.”
