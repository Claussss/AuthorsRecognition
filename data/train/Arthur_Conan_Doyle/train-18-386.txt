I had asked Chamberlain to throw out his men in skirmishing order, and
to give them directions to retreat slowly upon the waggons so as to draw
the Afridis on. The ruse succeeded to perfection. As the redcoats steadily retired, keeping behind cover as much as
possible, the enemy followed them up with yells of exultation, springing
from rock to rock, waving their jezails in the air, and howling like a
pack of demons.
