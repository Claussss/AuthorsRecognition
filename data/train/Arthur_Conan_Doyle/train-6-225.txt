The two travelers had dinner at the monk's hospitium, Nigel at the high
table and Aylward among the commonalty. Then again they roamed the high
street on business intent. Nigel bought taffeta for hangings, wine,
preserves, fruit, damask table linen and many other articles of need. At
last he halted before the armorer's shop at the castle-yard, staring at
the fine suits of plate, the engraved pectorals, the plumed helmets, the
cunningly jointed gorgets, as a child at a sweet-shop.
