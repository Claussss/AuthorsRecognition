best-ordered in Rome. What is amiss with you this morning?" "Nothing could be amiss with us now that CÃ¦sar has deigned to come under
my roof," said the courtier. "This is indeed a most glad surprise which
you have prepared for me." "It was an afterthought," said Domitian. "When you and the others had
left me, I was in no mood for sleep, and so it came into my mind that I
would have a breath of morning air by coming down to you, and seeing
this Grecian Venus of yours, about which you discoursed so eloquently
between the cups. But, indeed, by your appearance and that of your
servants, I should judge that my visit was an ill-timed one."
