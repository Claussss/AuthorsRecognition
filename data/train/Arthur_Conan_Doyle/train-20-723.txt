      It was already dark when we reached the old university city.
      Holmes took a cab at the station and ordered the man to drive to
      the house of Dr. Leslie Armstrong. A few minutes later, we had
      stopped at a large mansion in the busiest thoroughfare. We were
      shown in, and after a long wait were at last admitted into the
      consulting-room, where we found the doctor seated behind his
      table.
