“Take this sword!” said Nigel, and he turned the hilt to the cripple.
“Now!” he added, as he drew his hunting knife. “Kill me if you can, Paul
de la Fosse, for as God is my help I will do as much for you!” The woman, half swooning and yet spellbound and fascinated, looked on
at that strange combat. For a moment the cripple stood with an air of
doubt, the sword grasped in his nerveless fingers. Then as he saw the
tiny blade in Nigel's hand the greatness of the advantage came home to
him, and a cruel smile tightened his loose lips. Slowly, step by step he
advanced, his chin sunk upon his chest, his eyes glaring from under the
thick tangle of his brows like fires through the brushwood. Nigel waited
for him, his left hand forward, his knife down by his hip, his face
grave, still and watchful.
