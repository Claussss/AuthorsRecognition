bravos, not mansos; they watch us every mile of the way; kill us if
they can." "How can they watch us?" I asked, gazing into the dark, motionless void. The half-breed shrugged his broad shoulders. "The Indians know.  They have their own way.  They watch us.  They talk
the drum talk to each other.  Kill us if they can."
