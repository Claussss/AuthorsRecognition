      “I hope that you are satisfied now?” said Mr. Cunningham, tartly.       “Thank you, I think I have seen all that I wished.”       “Then if it is really necessary we can go into my room.”       “If it is not too much trouble.”       The J.P. shrugged his shoulders, and led the way into his own
      chamber, which was a plainly furnished and commonplace room. As
      we moved across it in the direction of the window, Holmes fell
      back until he and I were the last of the group. Near the foot of
      the bed stood a dish of oranges and a carafe of water. As we
      passed it Holmes, to my unutterable astonishment, leaned over in
      front of me and deliberately knocked the whole thing over. The
      glass smashed into a thousand pieces and the fruit rolled about
      into every corner of the room.
