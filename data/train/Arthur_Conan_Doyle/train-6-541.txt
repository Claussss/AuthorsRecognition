XV. HOW THE RED FERRET CAME TO COSFORD 
The old chronicler in his “Gestes du Sieur Nigel” has bewailed his
broken narrative, which rose from the fact that out of thirty-one years
of warfare no less than seven were spent by his hero at one time or

arose from privation and fatigue. Here at the very threshold of his
career, on the eve of a great enterprise, this very fate befell him.
