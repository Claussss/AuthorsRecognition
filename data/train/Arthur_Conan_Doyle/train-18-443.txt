Clearly this was the spot which, under the name of the Hole of Cree,
bore such a sinister reputation among the rustics. I could not wonder at
its impressing their imagination, for a more weird or gloomy scene, or
one more worthy of the avenue which led to it, could not be conceived. The steps passed down the declivity which surrounded the abyss, and we
followed them with a sinking feeling in our hearts, as we realised that
this was the end of our search.
