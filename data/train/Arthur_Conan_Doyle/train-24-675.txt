“By Saint James of Santiago!” cried Don Pedro, with a tinge of color
upon his pale cheeks, “win who will, this has been a most notable
contest.” “Who comes next for England, John?” asked the prince in a voice which
quivered with excitement. “Sir Nigel Loring of Hampshire, sire.” “Ha! he is a man of good courage, and skilled in the use of all
weapons.” “He is indeed, sire. But his eyes, like my own, are the worse for wars.
Yet he can tilt or play his part at hand-strokes as merrily as ever. It
was he, sire, who won the golden crown which Queen Philippa, your royal
mother, gave to be jousted for by all the knights of England after
the harrying of Calais. I have heard that at Twynham Castle there is a
buffet which groans beneath the weight of his prizes.”
