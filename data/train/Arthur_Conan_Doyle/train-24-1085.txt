On their journey home through the woods Alleyne learnt their
wondrous story: how, when Sir Nigel came to his senses, he with his
fellow-captive had been hurried to the coast, and conveyed by sea to
their captor's castle; how upon the way they had been taken by a Barbary
rover, and how they exchanged their light captivity for a seat on a
galley bench and hard labor at the pirate's oars; how, in the port at
Barbary, Sir Nigel had slain the Moorish captain, and had swum with
Aylward to a small coaster which they had taken, and so made their way
to England with a rich cargo to reward them for their toils. All this
Alleyne listened to, until the dark keep of Twynham towered above them
in the gloaming, and they saw the red sun lying athwart the rippling
Avon. No need to speak of the glad hearts at Twynham Castle that night,
nor of the rich offerings from out that Moorish cargo which found their
way to the chapel of Father Christopher.
