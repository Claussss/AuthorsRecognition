It was most awkward about the key in the morning.  Luckily, there was
an under-gardener below, and I asked him to throw it up.  No doubt he
thought I had just dropped it.  I will have doors and windows screwed
up and six stout men to hold me down in my bed before I will surrender
myself to be hag-ridden in this way. I had a note from Mrs. Marden this afternoon asking me to go round and
see her.  I intended to do so in any case, but had not excepted to find
bad news waiting for me.  It seems that the Armstrongs, from whom
Agatha has expectations, are due home from Adelaide in the Aurora, and
that they have written to Mrs. Marden and her to meet them in town.
They will probably be away for a month or six weeks, and, as the Aurora
is due on Wednesday, they must go at once--to-morrow, if they are ready
in time.  My consolation is that when we meet again there will be no
more parting between Agatha and me.
