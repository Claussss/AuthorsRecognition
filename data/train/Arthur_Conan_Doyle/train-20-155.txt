      and I, and so avoid this nuisance.’       “‘What, be driven out of our own house by a practical joker?’

      morning.’       “Suddenly, as she spoke, I saw her white face grow whiter yet in
      the moonlight, and her hand tightened upon my shoulder. Something
      was moving in the shadow of the tool-house. I saw a dark,
      creeping figure which crawled round the corner and squatted in
      front of the door. Seizing my pistol, I was rushing out, when my
      wife threw her arms round me and held me with convulsive
      strength. I tried to throw her off, but she clung to me most
      desperately. At last I got clear, but by the time I had opened
      the door and reached the house the creature was gone. He had left
      a trace of his presence, however, for there on the door was the
      very same arrangement of dancing men which had already twice
      appeared, and which I have copied on that paper. There was no
      other sign of the fellow anywhere, though I ran all over the
      grounds. And yet the amazing thing is that he must have been
      there all the time, for when I examined the door again in the
      morning, he had scrawled some more of his pictures under the line
      which I had already seen.”
