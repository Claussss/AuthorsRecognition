"Very good," said the Professor, indulgently; "we leave it at that.  I
will now ask you to look at this bone." He handed over the one which he
had already described as part of the dead man's possessions.  It was
about six inches long, and thicker than my thumb, with some indications
of dried cartilage at one end of it. "To what known creature does that bone belong?" asked the Professor. I examined it with care and tried to recall some half-forgotten
knowledge.
