â€œI was on my guard all that next day, and never went out into the park.
It's as well, or he'd have had the drop on me with that buckshot gun of
his before ever I could draw on him. After the bridge was up--my mind
was always more restful when that bridge was up in the evenings--I put
the thing clear out of my head. I never dreamed of his getting into the
house and waiting for me. But when I made my round in my dressing
gown, as was my habit, I had no sooner entered the study than I scented
danger. I guess when a man has had dangers in his life--and I've had
more than most in my time--there is a kind of sixth sense that waves
the red flag. I saw the signal clear enough, and yet I couldn't tell you
why. Next instant I spotted a boot under the window curtain, and then I
saw why plain enough.
