nothing, because at this instant the door opened and Chandos entered.
With joy in his face he stepped forward to the couch and took Nigel's
hand in his. Then he whispered a word in Aylward's ear, who hurried from
the room. “Pardieu! this is a good sight,” said the knight. “I trust that you will
soon be on your feet again.” “I crave your pardon, my honored lord, that I have been absent from your
side,” said Nigel.
