"Nay!" cried one, more hopeful than the rest, "at least we are brave men
with arms in our hands." "Fool!" said another, "is it not such talk which has brought us to our
ruin? What is the brave man untrained to the brave man trained? When
you stand before the sweep and rush of a Roman legion you may learn the
difference." "Then let us train!" "Too late! A full year is needful to turn a man to a soldier. Where will
you--where will your city be within the year? Nay, there is but one
chance for us. If we give up our commerce and our colonies, if we strip
ourselves of all that made us great, then perchance the Roman conqueror
may hold his hand."
