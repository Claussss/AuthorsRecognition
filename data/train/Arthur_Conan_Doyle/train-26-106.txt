And yet I could only give him two places in my team. One would be
for the "Gold Bug," the other for the "Murder in the Rue Morgue." I
do not see how either of those could be bettered. But I would not
admit _perfect_ excellence to any other of his stories. These two
have a proportion and a perspective which are lacking in the others,
the horror or weirdness of the idea intensified by the coolness of
the narrator and of the principal actor, Dupin in the one case and
Le Grand in the other. The same may be said of Bret Harte, also one
of those great short story tellers who proved himself incapable of
a longer flight. He was always like one of his own gold-miners who
struck a rich pocket, but found no continuous reef. The pocket was,
alas, a very limited one, but the gold was of the best. "The Luck of
Roaring Camp" and "Tennessee's Partner" are both, I think, worthy
of a place among my immortals. They are, it is true, so tinged with
Dickens as to be almost parodies of the master, but they have a
symmetry and satisfying completeness as short stories to which
Dickens himself never attained. The man who can read those two
stories without a gulp in the throat is not a man I envy.
