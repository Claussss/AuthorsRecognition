“Well, you can go to him and promise two hundred pounds each if they
will help us. You do not think we could buy over some Arabs?” Mansoor shook his head. “Too much danger to try,” said he. “Suppose you
try and fail, then that will be the end to all of us. I will go tell
what you have said.” He strolled off to where the old negro gunner was
grooming his camel and waiting for his reply. The Emirs had intended to halt for a half-hour at the most, but the
baggage-camels which bore the prisoners were so worn out with the long,
rapid march, that it was clearly impossible that they should move for
some time. They had laid their long necks upon the ground, which is
the last symptom of fatigue. The two chiefs shook their heads when they
inspected them, and the terrible old man looked with his hard-lined,
rock features at the captives. Then he said something to Mansoor, whose
face turned a shade more sallow as he listened.
