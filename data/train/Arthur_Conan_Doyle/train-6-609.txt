At the farther end, seated on a barrel as a throne of honor, with
trays and boxes of feathers around him, was Bartholomew the bowyer and
Fletcher, a fat, bald-headed man, whose task it was to see that every
man's tackle was as it should be, and who had the privilege of selling
such extras as they might need. A group of archers with their staves and
quivers filed before him with complaints or requests, while half a dozen
of the seniors gathered at his back and listened with grinning faces to
his comments and rebukes.
