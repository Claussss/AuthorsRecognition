The outlaw, who had opened his eyes, looked with a scowl from his captor
to the new-comer. “You are in luck, archer,” said he, “for I have come
to grips with many a man, but I cannot call to mind any who have had the
better of me.” “You have indeed the grip of a bear,” said Aylward; “but it was a coward
deed that your wife should hold me while you dashed out my brains with
a stick. It is also a most villainous thing to lay a snare for wayfarers
by asking for their pity and assistance, so that it was our own soft
hearts which brought us into such danger. The next who hath real need of
our help may suffer for your sins.”
