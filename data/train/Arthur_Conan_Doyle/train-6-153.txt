“We are indeed men of peace, Sir John, and little skilled in warlike
blazonry,” said he; “yet stout as are our Abbey walls, they are not so
thick that the fame of your exploits has not passed through them and
reached our ears. If it be your pleasure to take an interest in this
young and misguided Squire, it is not for us to thwart your kind
intention or to withhold such grace as you request. I am glad indeed
that he hath one who can set him so fair an example for a friend.”
