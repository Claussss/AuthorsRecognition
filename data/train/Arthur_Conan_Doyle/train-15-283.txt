I promised you, my dear uncle, that I would tell you anything of
interest concerning the siege of Jerusalem; but, indeed, these people
whom we imagined to be unwarlike have kept us so busy that there has
been little time for letter-writing. We came to Judæa thinking that a
mere blowing of trumpets and a shout would finish the affair, and
picturing a splendid triumph in the _via sacra_ to follow, with all the
girls in Rome throwing flowers and kisses to us. Well, we may get our
triumph, and possibly the kisses also, but I can assure you that not
even you who have seen such hard service on the Rhine can ever have
experienced a more severe campaign than this has been. We have now won
the town, and to-day their temple is burning, and the smoke sets me
coughing as I sit writing in my tent. But it has been a terrible
business, and I am sure none of us wish to see Judæa again.
