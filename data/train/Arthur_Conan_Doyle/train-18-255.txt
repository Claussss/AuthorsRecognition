“Yes, I heard him,” said I. “It was very painful to listen to him,” said
my father. “I wonder if he would object to my putting a small mustard

the brain. Or perhaps it would be best to wake him up and give him two
antibilious pills. What do you think, Jack?” “I think,” said I, with a yawn, “that you had best let him sleep, and go
to sleep yourself. You can physic him in the morning if he needs it.”
