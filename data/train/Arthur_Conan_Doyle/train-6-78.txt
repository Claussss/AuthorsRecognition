IV. HOW THE SUMMONER CAME TO THE MANOR HOUSE OF TILFORD 
By the date of this chronicle the ascetic sternness of the old Norman
castles had been humanized and refined so that the new dwellings of the
nobility, if less imposing in appearance, were much more comfortable
as places of residence. A gentle race had built their houses rather for
peace than for war. He who compares the savage bareness of Pevensey or
Guildford with the piled grandeur of Bodmin or Windsor cannot fail to
understand the change in manners which they represent.
