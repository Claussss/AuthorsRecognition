The old man chuckled. "I've got brother Jarge's girl to look after me now.  She'll see I
don't break barracks or do what I hadn't ought to.  Why, darn my skin,
I knew something was amiss! "With what?" "Why, with them soldiers.  You saw them pass, doctor--eh?  They'd
forgot their stocks.  Not one on 'em had his stock on."  He croaked and
chuckled for a long time over his discovery.  "It wouldn't ha' done for
the Dook!" he muttered.  "No, by Jimini! the Dook would ha' had a word
there."
