      “It was simple enough, sir, if you only had known, but, with all
      your cleverness, it was impossible that you could know. Time was,
      sir, when I was butler to old Sir Jabez Gilchrist, this young
      gentleman’s father. When he was ruined I came to the college as
      servant, but I never forgot my old employer because he was down
      in the world. I watched his son all I could for the sake of the
      old days. Well, sir, when I came into this room yesterday, when
      the alarm was given, the very first thing I saw was Mr.
      Gilchrist’s tan gloves a-lying in that chair. I knew those gloves
      well, and I understood their message. If Mr. Soames saw them, the
      game was up. I flopped down into that chair, and nothing would
      budge me until Mr. Soames he went for you. Then out came my poor
      young master, whom I had dandled on my knee, and confessed it all
      to me. Wasn’t it natural, sir, that I should save him, and wasn’t
      it natural also that I should try to speak to him as his dead
      father would have done, and make him understand that he could not
      profit by such a deed? Could you blame me, sir?”
