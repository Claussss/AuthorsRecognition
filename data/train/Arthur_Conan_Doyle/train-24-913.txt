ever had the name of a true and loyal knight. Surely you will not hold

hired slaves, but free companions, who will do nothing save by their own
good wills. In very sooth, my Lord Loring, they are ill men to trifle
with, and it were easier to pluck a bone from a hungry bear than to lead
a bowman out of a land of plenty and of pleasure.”
