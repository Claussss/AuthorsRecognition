‘Then, little one, you must sit here,’ said I, raising her up from my
knee and placing her on a chair in a corner. ‘You must be a brave lass
and sit still, whatever may chance. Will you do so?’ She pursed up her rosy lips and nodded her head. ‘He comes on apace, Micah,’ quoth my comrade, who was still standing
by the casement. ‘Is he not like some treacherous fox or other beast of
prey?’ There was indeed something in his lean, black-clothed figure and swift
furtive movements which was like some cruel and cunning animal. He stole
along under shadow of the stunted trees and withies, with bent body and
gliding gait, so that from Bridgewater it would be no easy matter for
the most keen-sighted to see him. Indeed, he was so far from the town
that he might safely have come out from his concealment and struck
across the moor, but the deep morass on either side prevented him from
leaving the road until he had passed the cottage.
