      “It was a prosaic way of forming a friendship, but it was
      effective. I was laid by the heels for ten days, but Trevor used
      to come in to inquire after me. At first it was only a minute’s
      chat, but soon his visits lengthened, and before the end of the
      term we were close friends. He was a hearty, full-blooded fellow,
      full of spirits and energy, the very opposite to me in most
      respects, but we had some subjects in common, and it was a bond
      of union when I found that he was as friendless as I. Finally, he
      invited me down to his father’s place at Donnithorpe, in Norfolk,
      and I accepted his hospitality for a month of the long vacation.
