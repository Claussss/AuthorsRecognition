‘He does know of it,’ said Reuben. ‘Yonder he stands under the trees
with his council about him. See, one of them rides this way!’ A trooper had indeed detached himself from the group and galloped
towards us. ‘If you are Captain Clarke, sir,’ he said, with a salute,
‘the King orders you to join his council.’ ‘Then I leave the Major in your keeping, Reuben,’ I cried. ‘See that
he hath what our means allow.’ So saying I spurred my horse, and soon
joined the group who were gathered round the King. There were Grey,
Wade, Buyse, Ferguson, Saxon, Hollis, and a score more, all looking very
grave, and peering down the valley with their glasses. Monmouth himself
had dismounted, and was leaning against the trunk of a tree, with his
arms folded upon his breast, and a look of white despair upon his face.
Behind the tree a lackey paced up and down leading his glossy black
charger, who pranced and tossed his lordly mane, a very king among
horses.
