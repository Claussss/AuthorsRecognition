Too late did the Romans understand the man with whom they had to deal.
Their boarders who had flooded the Punic decks felt the planking sink
and sway beneath them. They rushed to gain their own vessels; but they,
too, were being drawn downwards, held in the dying grip of the great red
galley. Over they went and ever over. Now the deck of Magro's ship is
flush with the water, and the Romans', drawn towards it by the iron
bonds which hold them, are tilted downwards, one bulwark upon the waves,
one reared high in the air. Madly they strain to cast off the death-grip
of the galley. She is under the surface now, and ever swifter, with the
greater weight, the Roman ships heel after her. There is a rending
crash. The wooden side is torn out of one, and mutilated, dismembered,
she rights herself, and lies a helpless thing upon the water. But a last
yellow gleam in the blue water shows where her consort has been dragged
to her end in the iron death-grapple of her foeman. The tiger-striped
flag of Carthage has sunk beneath the swirling surface, never more to
be seen upon the face of the sea.
