      Holmes sat in silence for some little time.       “Where is the gentleman to whom you are engaged?” he asked at
      last.       “He is in the Midland Electrical Company, at Coventry.”       “He would not pay you a surprise visit?”       “Oh, Mr. Holmes! As if I should not know him!”       “Have you had any other admirers?”       “Several before I knew Cyril.”       “And since?”       “There was this dreadful man, Woodley, if you can call him an
      admirer.”
