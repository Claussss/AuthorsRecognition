“William! William!” he cried. “Surely you would not leave me?” But the other's helmet was closed and he could hear nothing. Beaumanoir
saw that he was staggering away as swiftly as he could. With a cry of
bitter despair, he drew into a knot as many of his braves as could still
move, and together they made a last rush upon the English spears. This
time he was firmly resolved, deep in his gallant soul, that he would
come no foot back, but would find his death there amongst his foemen
or carve a path into the heart of their ranks. The fire in his breast
spread from man to man of his followers, and amid the crashing of blows
they still locked themselves against the English shields and drove hard
for an opening in their ranks.
