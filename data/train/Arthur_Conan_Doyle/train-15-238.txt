Having passed Saint Sophia, the two travellers crossed the marble-paved
Augusteum, and saw upon their right the gilded gates of the hippodrome
through which a vast crowd of people was pressing, for though the
morning had been devoted to the religious ceremony, the afternoon was
given over to secular festivities. So great was the rush of the
populace that the two strangers had some difficulty in disengaging
themselves from the stream and reaching the huge arch of black marble
which formed the outer gate of the palace. Within they were fiercely
ordered to halt by a gold-crested and magnificent sentinel who laid his
shining spear across their breasts until his superior officer should
give them permission to pass. The abbot had been warned, however, that
all obstacles would give way if he mentioned the name of Basil the
eunuch, who acted as chamberlain of the palace and also as
Parakimomen--a high office which meant that he slept at the door of the
Imperial bed-chamber. The charm worked wonderfully, for at the mention
of that potent name the Protosphathaire, or Head of the Palace Guards,
who chanced to be upon the spot, immediately detached one of his
soldiers with instructions to convoy the two strangers into the presence
of the chamberlain.
