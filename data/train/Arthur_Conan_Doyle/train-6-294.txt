But small as was the party and humble the surroundings, the King in no
way relaxed that love of ceremony, of elaborate form and of brilliant
coloring which was one of his characteristics. The sumpter-mules
were unpacked, squires ran hither and thither, baths smoked in the
bed-chambers, silks and satins were unfolded, gold chains gleamed
and clinked, so that when at last, to the long blast of two court
trumpeters, the company took their seats at the board, it was the
brightest, fairest scene which those old black rafters had ever spanned.
