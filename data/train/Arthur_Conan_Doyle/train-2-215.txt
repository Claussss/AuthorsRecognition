We had heard of his presence in the district and had once or twice
caught sight of his tall figure upon the moorland paths. He made no
advances to us, however, nor would we have dreamed of doing so to him,
as it was well known that it was his love of seclusion which caused him
to spend the greater part of the intervals between his journeys in a
small bungalow buried in the lonely wood of Beauchamp Arriance. Here,
amid his books and his maps, he lived an absolutely lonely life,
attending to his own simple wants and paying little apparent heed to
the affairs of his neighbours. It was a surprise to me, therefore, to
hear him asking Holmes in an eager voice whether he had made any
advance in his reconstruction of this mysterious episode. “The county
police are utterly at fault,” said he, “but perhaps your wider
experience has suggested some conceivable explanation. My only claim to
being taken into your confidence is that during my many residences here
I have come to know this family of Tregennis very well—indeed, upon my
Cornish mother’s side I could call them cousins—and their strange fate
has naturally been a great shock to me. I may tell you that I had got
as far as Plymouth upon my way to Africa, but the news reached me this
morning, and I came straight back again to help in the inquiry.”
