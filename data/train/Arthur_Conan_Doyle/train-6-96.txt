“The Abbot would not hurt us. It is that gray lean wolf of a sacrist who
hungers for our land. Let him do his worst. I fear him not.” “He has such an engine at his back, Nigel, that even the bravest must
fear him. The ban which blasts a man's soul is in the keeping of his
church, and what have we to place against it? I pray you to speak him
fair, Nigel.” “Nay, dear lady, it is both my duty and my pleasure to do what you bid
me; but I would die ere I ask as a favor that which we can claim as a
right. Never can I cast my eyes from yonder window that I do not see the
swelling down-lands and the rich meadows, glade and dingle, copse and
wood, which have been ours since Norman-William gave them to that Loring
who bore his shield at Senlac. Now, by trick and fraud, they have passed
away from us, and many a franklin is a richer man than I; but never
shall it be said that I saved the rest by bending my neck to their yoke.
Let them do their worst, and let me endure it or fight it as best I
may.”
