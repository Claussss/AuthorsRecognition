"Oh, I should love it!" cried Agatha. By this time all the company had gathered round us in a circle, the
shirt-fronted men, and the white-throated women, some awed, some
critical, as though it were something between a religious ceremony and
a conjurer's entertainment.  A red velvet arm-chair had been pushed
into the centre, and Agatha lay back in it, a little flushed and
trembling slightly from excitement.  I could see it from the vibration
of the wheat-ears.  Miss Penclosa rose from her seat and stood over
her, leaning upon her crutch.
