“I've got a map,” said the American, “and sometimes far away from
anything in the very midst of the waterless, trackless desert, I see
'ruins' marked upon it--or 'remains of a temple,' perhaps. For example,
the temple of Jupiter Ammon, which was one of the most considerable
shrines in the world, was hundreds of miles from anywhere. Those are the
ruins, solitary, unseen, unchanging through the centuries, which appeal
to one's imagination. But when I present a check at the door, and go
in as if it were Barnum's show, all the subtle feeling of romance goes
right out of it.”
