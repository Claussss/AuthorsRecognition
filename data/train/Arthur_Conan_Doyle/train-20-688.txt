THE ADVENTURE OF THE MISSING THREE-QUARTER       We were fairly accustomed to receive weird telegrams at Baker
      Street, but I have a particular recollection of one which reached
      us on a gloomy February morning, some seven or eight years ago,
      and gave Mr. Sherlock Holmes a puzzled quarter of an hour. It was
      addressed to him, and ran thus:       Please await me. Terrible misfortune. Right wing three-quarter
      missing, indispensable to-morrow. OVERTON.
