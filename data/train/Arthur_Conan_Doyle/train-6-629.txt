The center of the ship was held by the Spaniards; and having slain all
who stood before them, they were pressing up to either end before they
were made to understand that it was no fat sheep but a most fierce old
wolf which they had taken by the ears. If the lesson was late, it was the more thorough. Attacked on both sides
and hopelessly outnumbered, the Spaniards, who had never doubted that
this little craft was a merchant-ship, were cut off to the last man.
It was no fight, but a butchery. In vain the survivors ran screaming
prayers to the saints and threw themselves down into the galley
alongside. It also had been riddled with arrows from the poop of the
Basilisk, and both the crew on the deck and the galley-slaves in the
outriggers at either side lay dead in rows under the overwhelming
shower from above. From stem to rudder every foot of her was furred
with arrows. It was but a floating coffin piled with dead and dying men,
which wallowed in the waves behind them as the Basilisk lurched onward
and left her in the fog.
