      And yet for all his watchfulness he was never depressed. On the
      contrary, I can never recollect having seen him in such exuberant
      spirits. Again and again he recurred to the fact that if he could
      be assured that society was freed from Professor Moriarty he
      would cheerfully bring his own career to a conclusion.       “I think that I may go so far as to say, Watson, that I have not
      lived wholly in vain,” he remarked. “If my record were closed
      to-night I could still survey it with equanimity. The air of
      London is the sweeter for my presence. In over a thousand cases I
      am not aware that I have ever used my powers upon the wrong side.
      Of late I have been tempted to look into the problems furnished
      by nature rather than those more superficial ones for which our
      artificial state of society is responsible. Your memoirs will
      draw to an end, Watson, upon the day that I crown my career by
      the capture or extinction of the most dangerous and capable
      criminal in Europe.”
