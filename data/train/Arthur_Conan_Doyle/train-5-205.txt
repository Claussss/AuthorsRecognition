His pamphlet, On the Mesoblastic Origin of Excitomotor Nerve Roots, had
won him his fellowship of the Royal Society; and his researches, Upon
the Nature of Bathybius, with some Remarks upon Lithococci, had been

conviction that their class was only one step in his upward journey,
and that the first vacancy would remove him to some more illustrious
seat of learning.
