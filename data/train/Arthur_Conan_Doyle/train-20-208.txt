      “Well, I have been here a month now. I lived in that farm, where
      I had a room down below, and could get in and out every night,
      and no one the wiser. I tried all I could to coax Elsie away. I
      knew that she read the messages, for once she wrote an answer
      under one of them. Then my temper got the better of me, and I
      began to threaten her. She sent me a letter then, imploring me to
      go away, and saying that it would break her heart if any scandal
      should come upon her husband. She said that she would come down
      when her husband was asleep at three in the morning, and speak
      with me through the end window, if I would go away afterwards and
      leave her in peace. She came down and brought money with her,
      trying to bribe me to go. This made me mad, and I caught her arm
      and tried to pull her through the window. At that moment in
      rushed the husband with his revolver in his hand. Elsie had sunk
      down upon the floor, and we were face to face. I was heeled also,
      and I held up my gun to scare him off and let me get away. He
      fired and missed me. I pulled off almost at the same instant, and
      down he dropped. I made away across the garden, and as I went I
      heard the window shut behind me. That’s God’s truth, gentlemen,
      every word of it, and I heard no more about it until that lad
      came riding up with a note which made me walk in here, like a
      jay, and give myself into your hands.”
