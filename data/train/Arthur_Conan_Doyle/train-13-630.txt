      We had reached our house in Baker Street while we had been
      talking. Holmes ascended the stair first, and as he opened the
      door of our room he gave a start of surprise. Looking over his
      shoulder, I was equally astonished. His brother Mycroft was
      sitting smoking in the armchair.       “Come in, Sherlock! Come in, sir,” said he blandly, smiling at
      our surprised faces. “You don’t expect such energy from me, do
      you, Sherlock? But somehow this case attracts me.”
