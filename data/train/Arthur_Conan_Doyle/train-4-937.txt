‘It is a bold thing with raw peasants to attack old soldiers,’ quoth Sir
Stephen Timewell. ‘Yet if it is to be done, I know well that there is
not a man born within sound of the bells of St. Mary Magdalene who will
flinch from it.’ ‘You say well, Sir Stephen,’ said Monmouth. ‘At Dunbar Cromwell had
veterans at his back, and was opposed to troops who had small experience
of war.’ ‘Yet there is much good sense in what Major Hollis has said,’ remarked
Lord Grey. ‘We must either fall on, or be gradually girt round and
starved out. That being so, why not take advantage at once of the chance
which Feversham’s ignorance or carelessness hath given us? To-morrow, if
Churchill can prevail over his chief, I have little doubt that we
shall find their camp rearranged, and so have cause to regret our lost
opportunity.’
