As the two great ships hurtled together the Spaniard turned away a few
points so that the blow should be a glancing one. None the less it was
terrific. A dozen men in the tops of the carack were balancing a huge
stone with the intention of dropping it over on the English deck. With a
scream of horror they saw the mast cracking beneath them. Over it went,
slowly at first, then faster, until with a crash it came down on its
side, sending them flying like stones from a sling far out into the sea.
A swath of crushed bodies lay across the deck where the mast had fallen.
But the English ship had not escaped unscathed. Her mast held, it is
true, but the mighty shock not only stretched every man flat upon the
deck, but had shaken a score of those who lined her sides into the sea.
One bowman was hurled from the top, and his body fell with a dreadful
crash at the very side of the prostrate King upon the forecastle. Many
were thrown down with broken arms and legs from the high castles at
either end into the waist of the ship. Worst of all, the seams had been
opened by the crash and the water was gushing in at a dozen places.
