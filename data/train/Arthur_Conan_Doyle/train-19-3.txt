Which is a very sufficient reason why I am a little loath to go to
Professor Wilson's tonight.  Still I feel that I could hardly get out
of the invitation without positive rudeness; and, now that Mrs. Marden
and Agatha are going, of course I would not if I could.  But I had
rather meet them anywhere else.  I know that Wilson would draw me into
this nebulous semi-science of his if he could.  In his enthusiasm he is
perfectly impervious to hints or remonstrances.  Nothing short of a
positive quarrel will make him realize my aversion to the whole
business.  I have no doubt that he has some new mesmerist or
clairvoyant or medium or trickster of some sort whom he is going to
exhibit to us, for even his entertainments bear upon his hobby.  Well,
it will be a treat for Agatha, at any rate.  She is interested in it,
as woman usually is in whatever is vague and mystical and indefinite.
