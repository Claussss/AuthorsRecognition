She was of great beauty of face, figure, and manner.  She was four and
a half inches taller than Miss Cook, fair, whereas the latter was dark,
and as different from her as one woman could be from another.  Her
pulse rate was markedly slower.  She became for the time entirely one
of the company, walking about, addressing each person present, and
taking delight in the children.  She made no objection to photography
or any other test.  Forty-eight photographs of different degrees of
excellence were made of her.  She was seen at the same time as the
medium on several occasions.  Finally she departed, saying that her
mission was over and that she had other work to do.  When she vanished
materialism should have vanished also, if mankind had taken adequate
notice of the facts.
