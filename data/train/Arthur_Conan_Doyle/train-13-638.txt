      “You get a trifle beyond me there,” said the inspector, shrugging
      his shoulder. “It will not be an easy door to force, but we will
      try if we cannot make some one hear us.”       He hammered loudly at the knocker and pulled at the bell, but
      without any success. Holmes had slipped away, but he came back in
      a few minutes.       “I have a window open,” said he.       “It is a mercy that you are on the side of the force, and not
      against it, Mr. Holmes,” remarked the inspector, as he noted the
      clever way in which my friend had forced back the catch. “Well, I
      think that under the circumstances we may enter without an
      invitation.”
