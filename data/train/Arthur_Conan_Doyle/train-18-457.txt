In dealing with occult laws, however, we must allow for our own complete
ignorance of the subject. Did we know more we might see that there was
some analogy between that foul bog and the sacrilege which had been
committed, and that their ritual and customs demanded that just such a
death was the one appropriate to the crime. On this point I should be sorry to be dogmatic, but at least we must
allow that the Buddhist priests must have had some very good cause for
the course of action which they so deliberately carried out.
