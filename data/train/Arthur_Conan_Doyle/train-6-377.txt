“Would that I were dead,” he cried, “ere I saw dishonor come upon my
house, and am so tied with this accursed foot that I can neither examine
if it be true, nor yet avenge it! If my son Oliver were here, then all

for your son this night, that I may handle this matter in the way which
seems best. On jeopardy of my honor I will do all that a man may.”
