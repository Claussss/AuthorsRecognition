Personally I must confess that anything bearing upon the Arctic Seas
is always of the deepest interest to me. He who has once been within
the borders of that mysterious region, which can be both the most
lovely and the most repellent upon earth, must always retain
something of its glamour. Standing on the confines of known
geography I have shot the southward flying ducks, and have taken
from their gizzards pebbles which they have swallowed in some
land whose shores no human foot has trod. The memory of that
inexpressible air, of the great ice-girt lakes of deep blue water,
of the cloudless sky shading away into a light green and then into
a cold yellow at the horizon, of the noisy companionable birds, of
the huge, greasy-backed water animals, of the slug-like seals,
startlingly black against the dazzling whiteness of the ice--all of
it will come back to a man in his dreams, and will seem little more
than some fantastic dream itself, go removed is it from the main
stream of his life. And then to play a fish a hundred tons in
weight, and worth two thousand pounds--but what in the world has
all this to do with my bookcase?
