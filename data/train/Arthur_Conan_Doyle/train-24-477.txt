“By St. George!” cried Ford, “we are cut off from Sir Nigel.” “He is lost,” gasped Terlake. “Come, let us spring for it.” The two
youths jumped with all their strength to reach the departing galley.
Ford's feet reached the edge of the bulwarks, and his hand clutching a
rope he swung himself on board. Terlake fell short, crashed in among the
oars, and bounded off into the sea. Alleyne, staggering to the side, was
about to hurl himself after him, but Hordle John dragged him back by the
girdle.
