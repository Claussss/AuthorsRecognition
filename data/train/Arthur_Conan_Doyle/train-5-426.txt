"I saw you there," he said, in a timid, deprecating way.  "I wanted to
speak to you, if you could spare me a half-hour.  This cottage is mine.
I share it with Harrington of King's.  Come in and have a cup of tea." "I must be back presently," said Smith.  "I am hard on the grind at
present.  But I'll come in for a few minutes with pleasure.  I wouldn't
have come out only Hastie is a friend of mine."
