“Mort de ma vie!” Aylward shouted, looking down at the dice. “Never had
I such cursed luck. A murrain on the bones! I have not thrown a good
main since I left Navarre. A one and a three! En avant, camarade!” “Four and three,” cried Hordle John, counting on his great fingers,
“that makes seven. Ho, archer, I have thy cap! Now have at thee for thy
jerkin!” “Mon Dieu!” he growled, “I am like to reach Christchurch in my shirt.”
 Then suddenly glancing up, “Hola, by the splendor of heaven, here is our
cher petit! Now, by my ten finger bones! this is a rare sight to mine
eyes.” He sprang up and threw his arms round Alleyne's neck, while
John, no less pleased, but more backward and Saxon in his habits, stood
grinning and bobbing by the wayside, with his newly won steel cap stuck
wrong side foremost upon his tangle of red hair.
