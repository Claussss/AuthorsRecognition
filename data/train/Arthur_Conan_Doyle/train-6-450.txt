Then besides the men of the church there were the men of trade, the
merchant in dusty broadcloth and Flanders hat riding at the head of
his line of pack-horses. He carried Cornish tin, Welt-country wool,
or Sussex iron if he traded eastward, or if his head should be turned
westward then he bore with him the velvets of Genoa, the ware of Venice,
the wine of France, or the armor of Italy and Spain. Pilgrims were
everywhere, poor people for the most part, plodding wearily along with
trailing feet and bowed heads, thick staves in their hands and bundles
over their shoulders. Here and there on a gaily caparisoned palfrey, or
in the greater luxury of a horse-litter, some West-country lady might be
seen making her easy way to the shrine of Saint Thomas.
