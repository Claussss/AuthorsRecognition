"No, no," shouted Bellingham.  "Don't burn that!  Why, man, you don't
know what you do.  It is unique; it contains wisdom which is nowhere
else to be found." "Out with it!" "But look here, Smith, you can't really mean it.  I'll share the
knowledge with you.  I'll teach you all that is in it.  Or, stay, let
me only copy it before you burn it!" Smith stepped forward and turned the key in the drawer.  Taking out the
yellow, curled roll of paper, he threw it into the fire, and pressed it
down with his heel.  Bellingham screamed, and grabbed at it; but Smith
pushed him back, and stood over it until it was reduced to a formless
grey ash.
