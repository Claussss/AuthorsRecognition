      We had reached Pall Mall as we talked, and were walking down it
      from the St. Jamesâ€™s end. Sherlock Holmes stopped at a door some
      little distance from the Carlton, and, cautioning me not to
      speak, he led the way into the hall. Through the glass paneling I
      caught a glimpse of a large and luxurious room, in which a
      considerable number of men were sitting about and reading papers,
      each in his own little nook. Holmes showed me into a small
      chamber which looked out into Pall Mall, and then, leaving me for
      a minute, he came back with a companion whom I knew could only be
      his brother.
