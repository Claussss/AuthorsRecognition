It chanced that the opinion of the bowyer on this and other points
differed from that of Long Ned of Widdington, a surly straw-bearded
Yorkshireman, who had listened with a sneering face to his counsel. Now
he broke in suddenly upon the bowyer's talk. “You would do better to
sell bows than to try to teach others how to use them,” said he; “for
indeed, Bartholomew, that head of thine has no more sense within it than
it has hairs without. If you had drawn string for as many months as I
have years you would know that a straight-cut feather flies smoother
than a swine-backed, and pity it is that these young bowmen have none to
teach them better!”
