These results may be briefly stated thus.  A peculiar whitish matter
exuded from the subject, a girl named Eva, coming partly through her
skin, partly from her hands, partly from the orifices of her face,
especially her mouth.  This was photographed repeatedly at every stage
of its production, these photographs being appended to the printed
treatise.  This stuff, solid enough to enable one to touch and to
photograph, has been called the ectoplasm.  It is a new order of
matter, and it is clearly derived from the subject herself, absorbing
into her system once more at the end of the experiment.  It exudes in
such quantities as to entirely, cover her sometimes as with an apron.
It is soft and glutinous to the touch, but varies in form and even in
colour.  Its production causes pain and groans from the subject, and
any violence towards it would appear also to affect her.  A sudden
flash of light, as in a flash-photograph, may or may not cause a
retraction of the ectoplasm, but always causes a spasm of the subject.
When re-absorbed, it leaves no trace upon the garments through which it
has passed.
