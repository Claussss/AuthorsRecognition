The French monarch, seeing that his footmen had made no impression upon
the English, and also that the hedge had been well-nigh leveled to the
ground in the course of the combat, so that it no longer presented an
obstacle, had ordered his followers to remount their horses, and it was
as a solid mass of cavalry that the chivalry of France advanced to
their last supreme effort. The King was in the center of the front
line, Geoffrey de Chargny with the golden oriflamme upon his right, and
Eustace de Ribeaumont with the royal lilies upon the left. At his elbow
was the Duke of Athens, High Constable of France, and round him were the
nobles of the court, fiery and furious, yelling their warcries as they
waved their weapons over their heads. Six thousand gallant men of
the bravest race in Europe, men whose very names are like blasts of
a battle-trumpet--Beaujeus and Chatillons, Tancarvilles and
Ventadours--pressed hard behind the silver lilies.
