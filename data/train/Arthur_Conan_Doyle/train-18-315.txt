“I am not to disturb them until ten o'clock,” he said. “You have now
seen in operation one of the grandest results of our occult philosophy,
the dissociation of spirit from body. Not only are the spirits of these
holy men standing at the present moment by the banks of the Ganges, but
those spirits are clothed in a material covering so identical with their
real bodies that none of the faithful will ever doubt that Lal Hoomi and
Mowdar Khan are actually among them. This is accomplished by our power
of resolving an object into its chemical atoms, of conveying these
atoms with a speed which exceeds that of lightning to any given spot,
and of there re-precipitating them and compelling them to retake their
original form. Of old, in the days of our ignorance, it was necessary to
convey the whole body in this way, but we have since found that it was
as easy and more convenient to transmit material enough merely to build
up an outside shell or semblance. This we have termed the astral body.”
