      “‘The defeat of the Light Blues may be entirely attributed to the
      unfortunate absence of the crack International, Godfrey Staunton,
      whose want was felt at every instant of the game. The lack of
      combination in the three-quarter line and their weakness both in
      attack and defence more than neutralized the efforts of a heavy
      and hard-working pack.’”       “Then our friend Overton’s forebodings have been justified,” said
      Holmes. “Personally I am in agreement with Dr. Armstrong, and
      football does not come within my horizon. Early to bed to-night,
      Watson, for I foresee that to-morrow may be an eventful day.”
