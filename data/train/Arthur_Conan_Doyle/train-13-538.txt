      “‘I’ll tell you. I’ll take the house, furnish it, pay the maids,
      and run the whole place. All you have to do is just to wear out
      your chair in the consulting-room. I’ll let you have pocket-money
      and everything. Then you hand over to me three quarters of what
      you earn, and you keep the other quarter for yourself.’       “This was the strange proposal, Mr. Holmes, with which the man
      Blessington approached me. I won’t weary you with the account of
      how we bargained and negotiated. It ended in my moving into the
      house next Lady Day, and starting in practice on very much the
      same conditions as he had suggested. He came himself to live with
      me in the character of a resident patient. His heart was weak, it
      appears, and he needed constant medical supervision. He turned
      the two best rooms of the first floor into a sitting-room and
      bedroom for himself. He was a man of singular habits, shunning
      company and very seldom going out. His life was irregular, but in
      one respect he was regularity itself. Every evening, at the same
      hour, he walked into the consulting-room, examined the books, put
      down five and three-pence for every guinea that I had earned, and
      carried the rest off to the strong-box in his own room.
