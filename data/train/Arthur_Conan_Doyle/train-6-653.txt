“Another leak!” he cried. “I pray to Saint Leonard to bear us up this
day! Twenty of my shipmen are bailing with buckets, but the water rises
on them fast. The vessel may not float another hour.” The Prince had snatched a crossbow from one of his attendants and
leveled it at the Spaniard's tops. At the very instant when the seaman
stood erect with a fresh bar in his hands, the bolt took him full in
the face, and his body fell forward over the parapet, hanging there
head downward. A howl of exultation burst from the English at the sight,
answered by a wild roar of anger from the Spaniards. A seaman had run
from the Lion's hold and whispered in the ear of the shipman. He turned
an ashen face upon the Prince.
