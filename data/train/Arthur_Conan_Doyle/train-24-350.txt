“Little enough, lady, compared with those who were my teachers.” “Yet enough for my purpose, I doubt not. For I would have you give
an hour or two a day whilst you are with us in discoursing with my
daughter, the Lady Maude; for she is somewhat backward, I fear, and hath
no love for letters, save for these poor fond romances, which do but
fill her empty head with dreams of enchanted maidens and of errant
cavaliers. Father Christopher comes over after nones from the priory,
but he is stricken with years and slow of speech, so that she gets small
profit from his teaching. I would have you do what you can with her, and
with Agatha my young tire-woman, and with Dorothy Pierpont.”
