“And if I were you, Mike Scanlan, I would take a night off and keep
clear of it. There will be bloody work here before morning.” “Well, indeed then, Mac,” Scanlan answered. “It's not the will but the
nerve that is wanting in me. When I saw Manager Dunn go down at the
colliery yonder it was just more than I could stand. I'm not made for
it, same as you or McGinty. If the lodge will think none the worse
of me, I'll just do as you advise and leave you to yourselves for the
evening.”
