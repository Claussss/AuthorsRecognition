      It was a clang of the bell, followed instantly by heavy steps
      upon the stair. A moment later, our old friend Lestrade appeared
      in the doorway. Over his shoulder I caught a glimpse of one or
      two uniformed policemen outside.       “Mr. John Hector McFarlane?” said Lestrade.       Our unfortunate client rose with a ghastly face.       “I arrest you for the wilful murder of Mr. Jonas Oldacre, of
      Lower Norwood.”
