Nigel, still at his place near Chandos' elbow, was hotly attacked by
a short broad-shouldered warrior upon a stout white cob, but Pommers
reared with pawing fore feet and dashed the smaller horse to the ground.
The falling rider clutched Nigel's arm and tore him from the saddle, so
that the two rolled upon the grass under the stamping hoofs, the English
squire on the top, and his shortened sword glimmered before the visor of
the gasping, breathless Frenchman.
