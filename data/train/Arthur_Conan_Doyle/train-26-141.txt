If you want the real human Fielding you will find him not in the
novels, where his real kindliness is too often veiled by a mock
cynicism, but in his "Diary of his Voyage to Lisbon." He knew
that his health was irretrievably ruined and that his years were
numbered. Those are the days when one sees a man as he is, when he
has no longer a motive for affectation or pretence in the immediate
presence of the most tremendous of all realities. Yet, sitting in
the shadow of death, Fielding displayed a quiet, gentle courage and
constancy of mind, which show how splendid a nature had been
shrouded by his earlier frailties.
