So they knelt together among the black rocks, and prayed as some of them
had never prayed before. It was very well to discuss prayer and treat it
lightly and philosophically upon the deck of the _Korosko_. It was easy
to feel strong and self-confident in the comfortable deck-chair, with
the slippered Arab handing round the coffee and liqueurs. But they had
been swept out of that placid stream of existence, and dashed against
the horrible, jagged facts of life. Battered and shaken, they must have
something to cling to. A blind, inexorable destiny was too horrible a
belief. A chastening power, acting intelligently and for a purpose,--a
living, working power, tearing them out of their grooves, breaking down
their small sectarian ways, forcing them into the better path,--that
was what they had learned to realise during these days of horror.
Great hands had closed suddenly upon them and had moulded them into new
shapes, and fitted them for new uses. Could such a power be deflected
by any human supplication? It was that or nothing,--the last court of
appeal, left open to injured humanity. And so they all prayed, as lover
loves, or a poet writes, from the very inside of their souls, and
they rose with that singular, illogical feeling of inward peace and
satisfaction which prayer only can give.
