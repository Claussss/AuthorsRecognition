      “The absence of the latter means nothing, though its presence may
      mean everything,” said Holmes. “Unless the powder from a badly
      fitting cartridge happens to spurt backward, one may fire many
      shots without leaving a sign. I would suggest that Mr. Cubitt’s
      body may now be removed. I suppose, Doctor, you have not
      recovered the bullet which wounded the lady?”       “A serious operation will be necessary before that can be done.
      But there are still four cartridges in the revolver. Two have
      been fired and two wounds inflicted, so that each bullet can be
      accounted for.”
