â€œI had at last fallen into a troubled sleep when I was suddenly aroused
by a loud, sonorous sound ringing in my ears. I sat up bewildered, but
all was silent again. The lamp was burning low, and my watch showed
me that it was going on to midnight. I blundered to my feet, and was
striking a match with the intention of lighting the candles, when the
sharp, vehement cry broke out again so loud and so clear that it might
have been in the very room with me. My chamber is in the front of the
house, while those of my mother and sister are at the back, so that I am
the only one who commands a view of the avenue.
