      “A day’s work ruined, Watson,” said he, striding across to the
      window. “Ha! the stars are out and the wind has fallen. What do
      you say to a ramble through London?”       I was weary of our little sitting-room and gladly acquiesced. For
      three hours we strolled about together, watching the
      ever-changing kaleidoscope of life as it ebbs and flows through
      Fleet Street and the Strand. Holmes had shaken off his temporary
      ill-humour, and his characteristic talk, with its keen observance
      of detail and subtle power of inference held me amused and
      enthralled. It was ten o’clock before we reached Baker Street
      again. A brougham was waiting at our door.
