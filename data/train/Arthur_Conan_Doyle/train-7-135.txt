His words were interrupted by a high, eager voice which broke suddenly
into a torrent of jostling words, words without meaning, pouring
strenuously out in angry assertions and foolish repetitions. The pink
had deepened to scarlet upon Mr. Stuart's cheeks, his eyes were vacant
but brilliant, and he gabbled, gabbled, gabbled as he rode. Kindly
mother Nature! she will not let her children be mishandled too far.
“This is too much,” she says; “this wounded leg, these crusted lips,
this anxious, weary mind. Come away for a time, until your body becomes
more habitable.” And so she coaxes the mind away into the Nirvana of
delirium, while the little cell-workers tinker and toil within to get
things better for its home-coming. When you see the veil of cruelty
which nature wears, try and peer through it, and you will sometimes
catch a glimpse of a very homely, kindly face behind.
