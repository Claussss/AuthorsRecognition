“Courage, child!” they heard the tall man exclaim in strange hybrid
French. “If we can win another sixty paces we are safe.” “Hold it safe, father,” the other answered, in the same soft, mincing
dialect. “We have no cause for fear.” “Verily, they are heathens and barbarians,” cried the man; “mad,
howling, drunken barbarians! Forty more paces, Tita mia, and I swear to
the holy Eloi, patron of all learned craftsmen, that I will never set
foot over my door again until the whole swarm are safely hived in their
camp of Dax, or wherever else they curse with their presence. Twenty
more paces, my treasure! Ah, my God! how they push and brawl! Get
in their way, Tita mia! Put your little elbow bravely out! Set your
shoulders squarely against them, girl! Why should you give way to these
mad islanders? Ah, cospetto! we are ruined and destroyed!”
