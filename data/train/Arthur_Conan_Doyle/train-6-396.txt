Nigel. Edith laid her hand upon his shoulder: “This is the man I love,
and the only man that I have ever loved. This is my husband,” said she. At the word Mary gave a cry of joy. “And is it so?” she cried. “Nay, then all is in honor, and God will see
to the rest. If you are man and wife before the altar, then indeed why
should I, or any other, stand between you? Tell me that it is indeed so,
and I return this moment to make your father a happy man.”
