      “I daresay my face looked as bewildered as yours did just now
      when first I read this message. Then I reread it very carefully.
      It was evidently as I had thought, and some secret meaning must
      lie buried in this strange combination of words. Or could it be
      that there was a prearranged significance to such phrases as ‘fly
      paper’ and ‘hen pheasant’? Such a meaning would be arbitrary and
      could not be deduced in any way. And yet I was loath to believe
      that this was the case, and the presence of the word ‘Hudson’
      seemed to show that the subject of the message was as I had
      guessed, and that it was from Beddoes rather than the sailor. I
      tried it backwards, but the combination ‘life pheasant’s hen’ was
      not encouraging. Then I tried alternate words, but neither ‘The
      of for’ nor ‘supply game London’ promised to throw any light upon
      it. And then in an instant the key of the riddle was in my hands,
      and I saw that every third word, beginning with the first, would
      give a message which might well drive old Trevor to despair.
