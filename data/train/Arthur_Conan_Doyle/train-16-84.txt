BORROWED SCENES      "It cannot be done. People really would not stand it. I know
     because I have tried."--_Extract from an unpublished paper upon
     George Borrow and his writings._ 
Yes, I tried and my experience may interest other people. You must
imagine, then, that I am soaked in George Borrow, especially in his
_Lavengro_ and his _Romany Rye_, that I have modelled both my thoughts,
my speech and my style very carefully upon those of the master, and that
finally I set forth one summer day actually to lead the life of which I
had read. Behold me, then, upon the country road which leads from the
railway-station to the Sussex village of Swinehurst.
