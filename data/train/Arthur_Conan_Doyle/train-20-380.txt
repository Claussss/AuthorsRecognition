      along the shoe. A thin film of recent mud was left upon his skin.       “Thank you,” said he, as he replaced the glass. “It is the second
      most interesting object that I have seen in the North.”       “And the first?”       Holmes folded up his check and placed it carefully in his
      notebook. “I am a poor man,” said he, as he patted it
      affectionately, and thrust it into the depths of his inner
      pocket.
