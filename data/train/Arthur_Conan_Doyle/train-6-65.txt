Once a long drone of dismay rose from the monks, as rearing higher and
higher yet a last mad effort sent the creature toppling over backward
upon its rider. But, swift and cool, he had writhed from under it ere
it fell, spurned it with his foot as it rolled upon the earth, and then
seizing its mane as it rose swung himself lightly on to its back once
more. Even the grim sacrist could not but join the cheer, as Pommers,
amazed to find the rider still upon his back, plunged and curveted down
the field.
