“Devil’s-foot root! No, I have never heard of it.” “It is no reflection upon your professional knowledge,” said he, “for I
believe that, save for one sample in a laboratory at Buda, there is no
other specimen in Europe. It has not yet found its way either into the
pharmacopœia or into the literature of toxicology. The root is shaped
like a foot, half human, half goatlike; hence the fanciful name given
by a botanical missionary. It is used as an ordeal poison by the
medicine-men in certain districts of West Africa and is kept as a
secret among them. This particular specimen I obtained under very
extraordinary circumstances in the Ubangi country.” He opened the paper
as he spoke and disclosed a heap of reddish-brown, snuff-like powder.
