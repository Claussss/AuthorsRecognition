I stopped, for the woman's head had fallen back, and she had fainted.
She could not bear to hear what I had to say to her!  What a glow of
satisfaction it gives me to think that, come what may, in the future
she can never misunderstand my true feelings toward her.  But what will
occur in the future?  What will she do next?  I dare not think of it.
Oh, if only I could hope that she will leave me alone!  But when I
think of what I said to her----  Never mind; I have been stronger than
she for once.
