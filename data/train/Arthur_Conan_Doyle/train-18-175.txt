It was ane day aboot the beginning of October, I was comin' oot o' the
stable, after giein' its oats tae the horse, when I seed a great muckle
loon come hoppin' on ane leg up the drive, mair like a big, ill-faured
craw than a man. When I clapped my een on him I thocht that maybe this was ane of the
rascals that the maister had been speakin' aboot, so withoot mair ado
I fetched oot my bit stick with the intention o' tryin' it upon the
limmer's heid. He seed me comin' towards him, and readin' my intention
frae my look maybe, or frae the stick in my hand, he pu'ed oot a lang
knife frae his pocket and swore wi' the most awfu' oaths that if I didna
stan' back he'd be the death o' me.
