“Who is he?” asked the Colonel. “It is Ali Wad Ibrahim, the same who raided last year, and killed all of
the Nubian village.” “I've heard of him,” said the Colonel. “He has the name of being one of the boldest and the most fanatical
of all the Khalifa's leaders. Thank God that the women are out of his
clutches.” The two Arabs had been talking in that stern, restrained fashion which
comes so strangely from a southern race. Now they both turned to the
dragoman, who was still kneeling upon the sand. They plied him with
questions, pointing first to one and then to another of their prisoners.
Then they conferred together once more, and finally said something to
Mansoor, with a contemptuous wave of the hand to indicate that he might
convey it to the others.
