Woe betide them if they fall into my hands. I would give them as short
a shrift as ever a Highland cateran got from a Glasgow judge. These
continued alarms may mean nothing or they may be an indication that the
Hillmen are assembling and have some plan in view. We have had no news from the Front for some time, but to-day a convoy of
wounded came through with the intelligence that Nott had taken Ghuznee.
I hope he warmed up any of the black rascals that fell into his hands.
