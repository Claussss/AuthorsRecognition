But in those few minutes whilst they had been assaulted upon both
sides, the losses of the English party had been heavy. The Anglo-Breton
D'Ardaine had fallen before Beaumanoir's sword, but not before he had
cut deeply into his enemy's shoulder. Sir Thomas Walton, Richard of
Ireland one of the Squires, and Hulbitee the big peasant had all fallen
before the mace of the dwarf Raguenel or the swords of his companions.
Some twenty men were still left standing upon either side, but all were
in the last state of exhaustion, gasping, reeling, hardly capable of
striking a blow.
