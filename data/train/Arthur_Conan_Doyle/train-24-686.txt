“And as to the prize, sire,” quoth Sir Nigel, “I am sure that I speak
for all when I say this French knight hath our leave to bear it away
with him if he can fairly win it.” “Bear word of this to your master,” said the prince, “and ask him which
of these five Englishmen he would desire to meet. But stay; your master
bears no coat-armor, and we have not yet heard his name.” “My master, sire, is under vow to the Virgin neither to reveal his name
nor to open his vizor until he is back upon French ground once more.”
