“I can well believe it,” returned Sir Nigel; “I have met no man who is
quicker to follow where honor leads.” “Nay, it is not for honor that I go, Nigel.” “For what then?” “For pullets.” “Yes, for the rascal vanguard have cleared every hen from the
country-side. It was this very morning that Norbury, my squire,
lamed his horse in riding round in quest of one, for we have a bag of
truffles, and nought to eat with them. Never have I seen such locusts as
this vanguard of ours. Not a pullet shall we see until we are in front
of them; so I shall leave my Winchester runagates to the care of the
provost-marshal, and I shall hie south with you, Nigel, with my truffles
at my saddle-bow.”
