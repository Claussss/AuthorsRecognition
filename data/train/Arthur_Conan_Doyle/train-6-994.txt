The Frenchman, John de Helennes, a squire of Picardy, had waited with a
burning heart, his soul sick at the flight of the division in which he
had ridden. In the hope of doing some redeeming exploit, or of meeting
his own death, he had loitered betwixt the armies, but no movement had
come from the English lines. Now he had turned his horse's head to join
the King's array, when the low drumming of hoofs sounded behind him,
and he turned to find a horseman hard upon his heels. Each had drawn his
sword, and the two armies paused to view the fight. In the first bout
Sir Maurice Berkeley's lance was struck from his hand, and as he sprang
down to recover it the Frenchman ran him through the thigh, dismounted
from his horse, and received his surrender. As the unfortunate
Englishman hobbled away at the side of his captor a roar of laughter
burst from both armies at the spectacle.
