A little way from the downward path was the return trail made by the
feet of those who had come back from the chasm's edge. Our eyes fell
upon these tracks at the same moment, and we each gave a cry of horror,
and stood gazing speechlessly at them. For there, in those blurred
footmarks, the whole drama was revealed. _Five had gone down, but only three had returned_. None shall ever know the details of that strange tragedy. There was no
mark of struggle nor sign of attempt at escape. We knelt at the edge of
the Hole and endeavoured to pierce the unfathomable gloom which shrouded
it. A faint, sickly exhalation seemed to rise from its depths, and there
was a distant hurrying, clattering sound as of waters in the bowels of
the earth.
