A fortnight had passed away, and the special boat which had been
placed at the disposal of the rescued tourists was already far north of
Assiout. Next morning they would find themselves at Baliani, where
one takes the express for Cairo. It was, therefore, their last evening
together. Mrs. Shlesinger and her child who had escaped unhurt had
already been sent down from the frontier. Miss Adams had been very ill
after her privations, and this was the first time that she had been
allowed to come upon deck after dinner. She sat now in a lounge-chair,
thinner, sterner, and kindlier than ever, while Sadie stood beside her
and tucked the rugs around her shoulders. Mr. Stephens was carrying over
the coffee and placing it on the wicker-table beside them. On the other
side of the deck Belmont and his wife were seated together in silent
sympathy and contentment. Monsieur Fardet was leaning against the rail
and arguing about the remissness of the British Government in not taking
a more complete control of the Egyptian frontier, while the Colonel
stood very erect in front of him, with the red end of a cigar-stump
protruding from under his moustache.
