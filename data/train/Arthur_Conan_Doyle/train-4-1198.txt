In the collection of loyal ballads reprinted in 1731, the Royalist bard
harps upon the same characteristic:           ‘We’ll down with universities
            Where learning is professed,
           Because they practise and maintain
            The language of the beast.
           We’ll drive the doctors out of doors,
            And parts, whate’er they be,
           We’ll cry all parts and learning down,
            And heigh, then up go we!’
