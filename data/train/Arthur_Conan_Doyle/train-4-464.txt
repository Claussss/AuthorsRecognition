‘Curse me if I like accepting this old fellow’s offer,’ said Sir Gervas,
in an undertone. ‘I have heard of these Puritan households. Much grace
to little sack, and texts flying about as hard and as jagged as flint
stones. To bed at sundown, and a sermon ready if ye do but look kindly
at the waiting-wench or hum the refrain of a ditty.’ ‘His home may be larger, but it could scarce be stricter than that of my
own father,’ I remarked.
