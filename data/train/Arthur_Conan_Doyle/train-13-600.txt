      “My dear Mycroft, I should be delighted.”       The brother scribbled a note upon a leaf of his pocket-book, and,
      ringing the bell, he handed it to the waiter.       “I have asked Mr. Melas to step across,” said he. “He lodges on
      the floor above me, and I have some slight acquaintance with him,
      which led him to come to me in his perplexity. Mr. Melas is a
      Greek by extraction, as I understand, and he is a remarkable
      linguist. He earns his living partly as interpreter in the law
      courts and partly by acting as guide to any wealthy Orientals who
      may visit the Northumberland Avenue hotels. I think I will leave
      him to tell his very remarkable experience in his own fashion.”
