‘No, but I can get a pair,’ said our companion, and springing upon his
horse he forced his way through the ditch, past the barrier, and so down
the road in the direction of the dragoons. The movement was so sudden and so unexpected that there was a dead
silence for a few seconds, which was broken by a general howl of hatred
and execration from the peasants. ‘Shoot upon him! Shoot down the false
Amalekite!’ they shrieked. ‘He hath gone to join his kind! He hath
delivered us up into the hands of the enemy! Judas! Judas!’ As to the
horsemen, who were still forming up for a charge and waiting for the
flanking party to get into position, they sat still and silent, not
knowing what to make of the gaily-dressed cavalier who was speeding
towards them.
