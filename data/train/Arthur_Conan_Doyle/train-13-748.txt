      “After breakfast, my dear Watson. Remember that I have breathed
      thirty miles of Surrey air this morning. I suppose that there has
      been no answer from my cabman advertisement? Well, well, we
      cannot expect to score every time.”       The table was all laid, and just as I was about to ring Mrs.
      Hudson entered with the tea and coffee. A few minutes later she
      brought in three covers, and we all drew up to the table, Holmes
      ravenous, I curious, and Phelps in the gloomiest state of
      depression.
