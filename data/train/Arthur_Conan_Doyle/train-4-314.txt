beer which are drunk by the common folk make little difference one way

sold more of my rare old wines in three days than ever I did before in
a calendar month. It is not ale, or strong waters, I promise you, that
those gentles drink, but Priniac, Languedoc, Tent, Muscadine, Chiante,
and Tokay--never a flask under the half-guinea.’
