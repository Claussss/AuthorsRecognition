Across the brown of the hard, pebbly desert there had been visible for
some time a single long, thin, yellow streak, extending north and south
as far as they could see. It was a band of sand not more than a few
hundred yards across, and rising at the highest to eight or ten feet.
But the prisoners were astonished to observe that the Arabs pointed at
this with an air of the utmost concern, and they halted when they came
to the edge of it like men upon the brink of an unfordable river. It
was very light, dusty sand, and every wandering breath of wind sent it
dancing into the air like a whirl of midges. The Emir Abderrahman tried
to force his camel into it, but the creature, after a step or two, stood
still and shivered with terror.
