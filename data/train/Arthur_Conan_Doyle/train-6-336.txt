Sir John Buttesthorn, the Knight of Duplin, was so called because he had
been present at that strange battle, some eighteen years before, when
the full power of Scotland had been for a moment beaten to the ground by
a handful of adventurers and mercenaries, marching under the banner
of no nation, but fighting in their own private quarrel. Their exploit
fills no pages of history, for it is to the interest of no nation to
record it, and yet the rumor and fame of the great fight bulked large in
those times, for it was on that day when the flower of Scotland was left
dead upon the field, that the world first understood that a new force
had arisen in war, and that the English archer, with his robust courage
and his skill with the weapon which he had wielded from his boyhood, was
a power with which even the mailed chivalry of Europe had seriously to
reckon.
