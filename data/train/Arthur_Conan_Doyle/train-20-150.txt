      “Why?”       “Because I had a wire from Hilton Cubitt this morning. You
      remember Hilton Cubitt, of the dancing men? He was to reach
      Liverpool Street at one-twenty. He may be here at any moment. I
      gather from his wire that there have been some new incidents of
      importance.”       We had not long to wait, for our Norfolk squire came straight
      from the station as fast as a hansom could bring him. He was
      looking worried and depressed, with tired eyes and a lined
      forehead.
