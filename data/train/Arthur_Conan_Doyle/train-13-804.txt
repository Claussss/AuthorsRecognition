      “Moriarty?”       “They have secured the whole gang with the exception of him. He
      has given them the slip. Of course, when I had left the country
      there was no one to cope with him. But I did think that I had put
      the game in their hands. I think that you had better return to
      England, Watson.”       “Why?”       “Because you will find me a dangerous companion now. This man’s
      occupation is gone. He is lost if he returns to London. If I read
      his character right he will devote his whole energies to
      revenging himself upon me. He said as much in our short
      interview, and I fancy that he meant it. I should certainly
      recommend you to return to your practice.”
