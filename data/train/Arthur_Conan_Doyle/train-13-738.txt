      “But how about our investigation in London?” asked Phelps,
      ruefully.       “We can do that to-morrow. I think that just at present I can be
      of more immediate use here.”       “You might tell them at Briarbrae that I hope to be back
      to-morrow night,” cried Phelps, as we began to move from the
      platform.       “I hardly expect to go back to Briarbrae,” answered Holmes, and
      waved his hand to us cheerily as we shot out from the station.
