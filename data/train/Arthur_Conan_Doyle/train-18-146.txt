CHAPTER VIII. STATEMENT OF ISRAEL STAKES 
(Copied and authenticated by the Reverend Mathew Clark, Presbyterian
Minister of Stoneykirk, in Wigtownshire) Maister Fothergill West and the meenister say that I maun tell all I can
aboot General Heatherstone and his hoose, but that I maunna say muckle
aboot mysel' because the readers wouldna care to hear aboot me or my
affairs. I am na sae sure o' that, for the Stakes is a family weel
kenned and respecked on baith sides o' the Border, and there's mony in
Nithsdale and Annandale as would be gey pleased to hear news o' the son
o' Archie Stakes, o' Ecclefechan.
