XXIII. HOW THIRTY OF JOSSELIN ENCOUNTERED THIRTY OF PLOERMEL 
All night the Castle of Ploermel rang with warlike preparations, for the
smiths were hammering and filing and riveting, preparing the armor for
the champions. In the stable yard hostlers were testing and grooming the
great war-horses, whilst in the chapel knights and squires were easing
their souls at the knees of old Father Benedict. Down in the courtyard, meanwhile, the men-at-arms had been assembled,
and the volunteers weeded out until the best men had been selected.
Black Simon had obtained a place, and great was the joy which shone
upon his grim visage. With him were chosen young Nicholas Dagsworth, a
gentleman adventurer who was nephew to the famous Sir Thomas, Walter the
German, Hulbitee--a huge peasant whose massive frame gave promise which
his sluggish spirit failed to fulfil--John Alcock, Robin Adey and Raoul
Provost. These with three others made up the required thirty. Great was
the grumbling and evil the talk amongst the archers when it was learned
that none of them were to be included, but the bow had been forbidden on
either side. It is true that many of them were expert fighters both
with ax and with sword, but they were unused to carry heavy armor, and
a half-armed man would have short shrift in such a hand-to-hand struggle
as lay before them.
