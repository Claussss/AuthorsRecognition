      “Your name?” asked Holmes.       “Patrick Cairns.”       “Harpooner?”       “Yes, sir. Twenty-six voyages.”       “Dundee, I suppose?”       “Yes, sir.”       “And ready to start with an exploring ship?”       “Yes, sir.”       “What wages?”       “Eight pounds a month.”       “Could you start at once?”       “As soon as I get my kit.”       “Have you your papers?”       “Yes, sir.” He took a sheaf of worn and greasy forms from his
      pocket. Holmes glanced over them and returned them.
