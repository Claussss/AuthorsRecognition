Again and again our good father remonstrated with us in his mild way for
our erratic behaviour and the continual interruption of his work which
arose from it. At last, however, the tea was brought, and the tea was taken, the
curtains were drawn, the lamps lit, and after another interminable
interval the prayers were read and the servants dismissed to their
rooms. My father compounded and swallowed his nightly jorum of toddy,
and then shuffled off to his room, leaving the two of us in the parlour
with our nerves in a tingle and our minds full of the most vague and yet
terrible apprehensions.
