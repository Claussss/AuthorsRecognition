Miss Adams, who had been frozen into silence during the long cold night,
began to thaw now in the cheery warmth of the rising sun. She looked
about her, and rubbed her thin hands together. “Why, Sadie,” she remarked, “I thought I heard you in the night, dear,
and now I see that you have been crying.” “I have been thinking, Auntie.” “Well, we must try and think of others,
dearie, and not of ourselves.” “It's not of myself, Auntie.” “Never fret
about me, Sadie.” “No, Auntie, I was not thinking of you.” “Was it of
any one in particular.” “Of Mr. Stephens, Auntie. How gentle he was,
and how brave! To think of him fixing up every little thing for us,
and trying to pull his jacket over his poor roped-up hands, with those
murderers waiting all round his. He's my saint and hero from now ever
after.”
