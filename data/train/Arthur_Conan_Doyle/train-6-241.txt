“A magpie! A magpie!” cried the falconer. “Nay, nay, it is not worthy of your talons, my brown-eyed queen,” said
the King, looking up at the great bird which flapped from side to
side above his head, waiting for the whistle which should give her the
signal. “The tercels, falconer--a cast of tercels! Quick, man, quick!
Ha! the rascal makes for wood! He puts in! Well flown, brave peregrine!
He makes his point. Drive him out to thy comrade. Serve him, varlets!
Beat the bushes! He breaks! He breaks! Nay, come away then! You will see
Master Magpie no more.”
