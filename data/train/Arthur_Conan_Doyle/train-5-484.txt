"Whisky," said Joseph M'Connor. "Quite so.  Whisky.  You see it there." Peter Stulpnagel smiled and shook his head. "Your argument is not very good," said he.  "When I used to take
whisky, I used to find that one glass would excite me, but that six
would send me to sleep, which is just the opposite.  Now, suppose that
electricity were to act in just the opposite way also, what then?" We three practical men burst out laughing.  We had known that our
colleague was queer, but we never had thought that he would be as queer
as this.
