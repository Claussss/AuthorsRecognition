‘Truth to tell, it doth not tempt me much,’ I answered. ‘Slow and solemn
I am by nature, and in such scenes as you have described I should feel a
very death’s head at a banquet.’ Sir Gervas was about to reply, when of a sudden out of the silence
of the night there rose a long-drawn piercing scream, which thrilled
through every nerve of our bodies. I have never heard such a wail of
despair. We pulled up our horses, as did the troopers behind us, and
strained our ears for some sign as to whence the sound proceeded, for
some were of opinion that it came from our right and some from our left.
The main body with the waggons had come up, and we all listened intently
for any return of the terrible cry. Presently it broke upon us again,
wild, shrill, and agonised: the scream of a woman in mortal distress.
