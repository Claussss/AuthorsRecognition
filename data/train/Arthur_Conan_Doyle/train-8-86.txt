"A chaotic case, my dear Watson," said Holmes over an evening pipe. "It

instinct of self-preservation.  It is remarkable only for the fact that

collaborator, the inspector, have kept our close hold on the essentials
and so been guided along the crooked and winding path.  Is there any
point which is not quite clear to you?"
