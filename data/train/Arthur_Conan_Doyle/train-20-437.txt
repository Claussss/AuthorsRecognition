      the side-table. If you sign it the whole matter will be settled.”       The seaman lurched across the room and took up the pen.       “Shall I sign here?” he asked, stooping over the table.       Holmes leaned over his shoulder and passed both hands over his

      cold muzzle of the revolver to his temple did he at last
      understand that resistance was vain. We lashed his ankles with
      cord, and rose breathless from the struggle.
