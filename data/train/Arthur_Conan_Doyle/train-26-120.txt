Is there not a sense of austere dignity? No man invents a style. It
always derives back from some influence, or, as is more usual, it is
a compromise between several influences. I cannot trace Poe's. And

they might have developed something of the kind. Now, by your leave, we will pass on to my noble edition of "The
Cloister and the Hearth," the next volume on the left.
