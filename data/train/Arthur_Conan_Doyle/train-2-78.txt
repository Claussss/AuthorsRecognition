“Yes, sir, Don Murillo, the Tiger of San Pedro,” said Baynes. “If you
look it up you will find that the San Pedro colours are green and
white, same as in the note, Mr. Holmes. Henderson he called himself,
but I traced him back, Paris and Rome and Madrid to Barcelona, where
his ship came in in ’86. They’ve been looking for him all the time for
their revenge, but it is only now that they have begun to find him
out.”
