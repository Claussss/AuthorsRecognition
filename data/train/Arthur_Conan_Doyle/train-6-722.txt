Once at St. Meen they passed a great nunnery, girt with a high gray
lichened wall, an oasis of peace in this desert of war, the black-robed
nuns basking in the sun or working in the gardens, with the strong
gentle hand of Holy Church shielding them ever from evil. The archers
doffed caps to them as they passed, for the boldest and roughest dared
not cross that line guarded by the dire ban and blight which was the one
only force in the whole steel-ridden earth which could stand betwixt the
weakling and the spoiler.
