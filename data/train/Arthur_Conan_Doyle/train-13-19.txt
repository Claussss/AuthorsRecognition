      “Hunter, on recovering from his stupor, was also quite positive
      as to the ownership of the cravat. He was equally certain that
      the same stranger had, while standing at the window, drugged his
      curried mutton, and so deprived the stables of their watchman.       “As to the missing horse, there were abundant proofs in the mud
      which lay at the bottom of the fatal hollow that he had been
      there at the time of the struggle. But from that morning he has
      disappeared, and although a large reward has been offered, and
      all the gypsies of Dartmoor are on the alert, no news has come of
      him. Finally, an analysis has shown that the remains of his
      supper left by the stable-lad contain an appreciable quantity of
      powdered opium, while the people at the house partook of the same
      dish on the same night without any ill effect.
