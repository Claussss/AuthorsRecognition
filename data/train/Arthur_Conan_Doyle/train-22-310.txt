McMurdo looked puzzled. Then he took a worn newspaper cutting from an
inner pocket. “You wouldn't squeal on a fellow?” said he. “I'll wipe my hand across your face if you say such words to me!” cried
McGinty hotly. “You are right, Councillor,” said McMurdo meekly. “I should apologize.
I spoke without thought. Well, I know that I am safe in your hands. Look
at that clipping.” McGinty glanced his eyes over the account of the shooting of one Jonas
Pinto, in the Lake Saloon, Market Street, Chicago, in the New Year week
of 1874.
