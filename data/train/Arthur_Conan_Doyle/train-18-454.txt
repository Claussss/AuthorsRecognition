In this way we came back to Edinburgh very much more important people
than we left it, and with no further reason to be uneasy about the
details of housekeeping. But, in truth, the whole household has been
dissolved, for I have been married for some months to my dear Gabriel,
and Esther is to become Mrs. Heatherstone upon the 23rd of the month. If
she makes him as good a wife as his sister has made me, we may both set
ourselves down as fortunate men.
