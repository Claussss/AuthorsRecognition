‘Henry, Duke of Beaufort, is unfortunately already in arms against his
sovereign,’ said Monmouth gloomily. ‘He is, sire, but he may be induced to turn in your favour the weapon
which he hath raised against you. He is a Protestant. He is said to be a
Whig. Why should we not send a message to him? Flatter his pride. Appeal
to his religion. Coax and threaten him. Who knows? He may have private
grievances of which we know nothing, and may be ripe for such a move.’
