streets on his way to the list, “I should have been glad to have
splintered a lance to-day. You have seen me hold a spear since I had
strength to lift one, and should know best whether I do not merit a
place among this honorable company.” “There is no better seat and no truer lance, sire,” said Chandos; “but,
if I may say so without fear of offence, it were not fitting that you
should join in this debate.”
