the carpet slippers from the hall. As Ames had observed, the soles of
both were dark with blood. “Strange!” murmured Holmes, as he stood in the light of the window and
examined them minutely. “Very strange indeed!” Stooping with one of his quick feline pounces, he placed the slipper
upon the blood mark on the sill. It exactly corresponded. He smiled in
silence at his colleagues.
