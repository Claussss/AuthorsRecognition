      Sherlock Holmes shrugged his shoulders.       “Prove it to me! Prove it to me! And if you can do so—!”       The fierce flash of her eyes said more than any words.       “I have come prepared to do so,” said Holmes, drawing several

      in York four years ago. It is indorsed ‘Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur,’
      but you will have no difficulty in recognizing him, and her also,
      if you know her by sight. Here are three written descriptions by
      trustworthy witnesses of Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur, who at that time
      kept St. Oliver’s private school. Read them and see if you can
      doubt the identity of these people.”
