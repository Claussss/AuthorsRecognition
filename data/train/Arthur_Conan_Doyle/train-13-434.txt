      “Throw the door open, officer,” said Holmes. “Now, it was on
      those stairs that young Mr. Cunningham stood and saw the two men
      struggling just where we are. Old Mr. Cunningham was at that
      window—the second on the left—and he saw the fellow get away just
      to the left of that bush. Then Mr. Alec ran out and knelt beside
      the wounded man. The ground is very hard, you see, and there are
      no marks to guide us.” As he spoke two men came down the garden
      path, from round the angle of the house. The one was an elderly
      man, with a strong, deep-lined, heavy-eyed face; the other a
      dashing young fellow, whose bright, smiling expression and showy
      dress were in strange contrast with the business which had
      brought us there.
