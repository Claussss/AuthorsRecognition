the door of the inner room was flung open, and the stranger bounded out

convulsed with anger. “Still here!” he snarled. “Dogs of England, must ye be lashed hence?

gaze fell upon the blazonry of sir Nigel's shield, and he stood staring,
while the fire in his strange green eyes softened into a sly and
humorous twinkle.
