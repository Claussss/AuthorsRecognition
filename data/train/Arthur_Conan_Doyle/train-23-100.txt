But now let us take this idea of a human being who has the power of
emitting a visible substance in which are formed faces which appear to
represent distinct individualities, and in extreme cases develop into
complete independent human forms.  Take this extraordinary fact, and
let us see whether, by an extension or modification of this
demonstrated process, we may not get some sort of clue as to the modus
operandi in other psychic phenomena.  It seems to me that we may, at
least, obtain indications which amount to a probability, though not to
a certainty, as to how some results, hitherto inexplicable, are
attained.  It is at any rate a provisional speculation, which may
suggest a hypothesis for future observers to destroy, modify, or
confirm.
