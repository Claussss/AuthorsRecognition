I cannot write the name of Maupassant without recalling what was
either a spiritual interposition or an extraordinary coincidence in
my own life. I had been travelling in Switzerland and had visited,
among other places, that Gemmi Pass, where a huge cliff separates
a French from a German canton. On the summit of this cliff was a
small inn, where we broke our journey. It was explained to us that,
although the inn was inhabited all the year round, still for about
three months in winter it was utterly isolated, because it could at
any time only be approached by winding paths on the mountain side,
and when these became obliterated by snow it was impossible either
to come up or to descend. They could see the lights in the valley
beneath them, but were as lonely as if they lived in the moon. So
curious a situation naturally appealed to one's imagination, and I
speedily began to build up a short story in my own mind, depending
upon a group of strong antagonistic characters being penned up in
this inn, loathing each other and yet utterly unable to get away
from each other's society, every day bringing them nearer to
tragedy. For a week or so, as I travelled, I was turning over
the idea.
