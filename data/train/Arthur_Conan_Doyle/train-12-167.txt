“I cannot understand it, father,” said Robert thoughtfully, as they
resumed their walk. “Supposing that your supposition is correct, who
would send him such quantities of gold, and where could it come from?” “Ha, you have to come to the old man after all!” chuckled his companion.
“I can see the little game. It is clear enough to me. There are two of
them in it, you understand. The other one gets the gold. Never mind how,
but we will hope that there is no harm. Let us suppose, for example,
that they have found a marvellous mine, where you can just shovel it out
like clay from a pit. Well, then, he sends it on to this one, and he has
his furnaces and his chemicals, and he refines and purifies it and makes
it fit to sell. That's my explanation of it, Robert. Eh, has the old man
put his finger on it?”
