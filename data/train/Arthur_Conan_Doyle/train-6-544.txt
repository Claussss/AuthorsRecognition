Sometime in that fell struggle he must have drawn his weakened body as
far as the narrow window, and hanging to the iron bars have looked down
on the wild scene beneath him. In the red glare of torches held from
windows and from roof he saw the rush and swirl of men below, the ruddy
light shining back from glowing brass and gleaming steel. As a wild
vision it came to him afterward, the beauty and the splendor, the flying
lambrequins, the jeweled crests, the blazonry and richness of surcoat
and of shield, where sable and gules, argent and vair, in every
pattern of saltire, bend or chevron, glowed beneath him like a drift of
many-colored blossoms, tossing, sinking, stooping into shadow, springing
into light. There glared the blood-red gules of Chandos, and he saw
the tall figure of his master, a thunderbolt of war, raging in the
van. There too were the three black chevrons on the golden shield which
marked the noble Manny. That strong swordsman must surely be the royal
Edward himself, since only he and the black-armored swift-footed youth
at his side were marked by no symbol of heraldry. “Manny! Manny!
George for England!” rose the deep-throated bay, and ever the gallant
counter-cry: “A Chargny! A Chargny! Saint Denis for France!” thundered
amid the clash and thudding of the battle.
