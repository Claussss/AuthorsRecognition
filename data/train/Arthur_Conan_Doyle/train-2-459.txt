high opinion of my honour,” said he, “you want the money before you

check, which he tore from the book, but he refrained from handing it to
his companion. “After all, since we are to be on such terms, Mr.
Altamont,” said he, “I don’t see why I should trust you any more than
you trust me. Do you understand?” he added, looking back over his
shoulder at the American. “There’s the check upon the table. I claim
the right to examine that parcel before you pick the money up.”
