      “But Holmes said that he was not going to Briarbrae.”       “I have known him for some time,” said I, “but I never knew him
      do anything yet without a very good reason,” and with that our
      conversation drifted off on to other topics.       But it was a weary day for me. Phelps was still weak after his
      long illness, and his misfortune made him querulous and nervous.
      In vain I endeavoured to interest him in Afghanistan, in India,
      in social questions, in anything which might take his mind out of
      the groove. He would always come back to his lost treaty,
      wondering, guessing, speculating, as to what Holmes was doing,
      what steps Lord Holdhurst was taking, what news we should have in
      the morning. As the evening wore on his excitement became quite
      painful.
