      “That was my singular interview with Professor Moriarty. I
      confess that it left an unpleasant effect upon my mind. His soft,
      precise fashion of speech leaves a conviction of sincerity which
      a mere bully could not produce. Of course, you will say: ‘Why not
      take police precautions against him?’ the reason is that I am
      well convinced that it is from his agents the blow will fall. I
      have the best proofs that it would be so.”
