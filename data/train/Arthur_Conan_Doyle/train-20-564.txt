      “I trust, Mr. Holmes, that you can spare me a few hours of your
      valuable time. We have had a very painful incident at St. Luke’s,
      and really, but for the happy chance of your being in town, I
      should have been at a loss what to do.”       “I am very busy just now, and I desire no distractions,” my
      friend answered. “I should much prefer that you called in the aid
      of the police.”
