      “Could you not follow it?”       “Excellent, Watson! You are scintillating this evening. The idea
      did cross my mind. There is, as you may have observed, a bicycle
      shop next to our inn. Into this I rushed, engaged a bicycle, and
      was able to get started before the carriage was quite out of
      sight. I rapidly overtook it, and then, keeping at a discreet
      distance of a hundred yards or so, I followed its lights until we
      were clear of the town. We had got well out on the country road,
      when a somewhat mortifying incident occurred. The carriage
      stopped, the doctor alighted, walked swiftly back to where I had
      also halted, and told me in an excellent sardonic fashion that he
      feared the road was narrow, and that he hoped his carriage did
      not impede the passage of my bicycle. Nothing could have been
      more admirable than his way of putting it. I at once rode past
      the carriage, and, keeping to the main road, I went on for a few
      miles, and then halted in a convenient place to see if the
      carriage passed. There was no sign of it, however, and so it
      became evident that it had turned down one of several side roads
      which I had observed. I rode back, but again saw nothing of the
      carriage, and now, as you perceive, it has returned after me. Of
      course, I had at the outset no particular reason to connect these
      journeys with the disappearance of Godfrey Staunton, and was only
      inclined to investigate them on the general grounds that
      everything which concerns Dr. Armstrong is at present of interest
      to us, but, now that I find he keeps so keen a look-out upon
      anyone who may follow him on these excursions, the affair appears
      more important, and I shall not be satisfied until I have made
      the matter clear.”
