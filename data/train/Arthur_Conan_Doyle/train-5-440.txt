"Come on, Smith!" he shouted.  "It's life and death, you know.  Hurry
up!  Now, then," he added, as the medical student reappeared, "let us
do a sprint.  It is well under a mile, and we should do it in five
minutes.  A human life is better worth running for than a pot." Neck and neck they dashed through the darkness, and did not pull up
until, panting and spent, they had reached the little cottage by the
river.  Young Lee, limp and dripping like a broken water-plant, was
stretched upon the sofa, the green scum of the river upon his black
hair, and a fringe of white foam upon his leaden-hued lips.  Beside him
knelt his fellow-student Harrington, endeavouring to chafe some warmth
back into his rigid limbs.
