The journey was not a long one, for presently, as they threaded their
way through the fields, there appeared before them a great gray oak
which spread its gnarled leafless branches over the corner of a green
and level meadow. The tree was black with the peasants who had climbed
into it, and all round it was a huge throng, chattering and calling
like a rookery at sunset. A storm of hooting broke out from them at the
approach of the English, for Bambro' was hated in the country where he
raised money for the Montfort cause by putting every parish to ransom
and maltreating those who refused to pay. There was little amenity in
the warlike ways which had been learned upon the Scottish border. The
champions rode onward without deigning to take notice of the taunts of
the rabble, but the archers turned that way and soon beat the mob to
silence. Then they resolved themselves into the keepers of the ground,
and pressed the people back until they formed a dense line along the
edge of the field, leaving the whole space clear for the warriors.
