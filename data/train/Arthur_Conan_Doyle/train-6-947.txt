King John, who sat upon the canopied dais at the upper end, was now in
the sixth year of his reign and the thirty-sixth of his life. He was a
short burly man, ruddy-faced and deep-chested, with dark kindly eyes and
a most noble bearing. It did not need the blue cloak sewed with silver
lilies to mark him as the King. Though his reign had been short, his
fame was already widespread over all Europe as a kindly gentleman and a
fearless soldier--a fit leader for a chivalrous nation. His elder son,
the Duke of Normandy, still hardly more than a boy, stood beside him,
his hand upon the King's shoulder, and John half turned from time to
time to fondle him. On the right, at the same high dais, was the King's
younger brother, the Duke of Orleans, a pale heavy-featured man, with a
languid manner and intolerant eyes. On the left was the Duke of Bourbon,
sad-faced and absorbed, with that gentle melancholy in his eyes and
bearing which comes often with the premonition of death. All these were
in their armor, save only for their helmets, which lay upon the board
before them.
