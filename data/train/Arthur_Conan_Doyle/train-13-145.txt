      “It was to see Sarah that he came to my house first, but soon it
      was to see us, for he was a man with winning ways, and he made
      friends wherever he went. He was a dashing, swaggering chap,
      smart and curled, who had seen half the world and could talk of
      what he had seen. He was good company, I won’t deny it, and he
      had wonderful polite ways with him for a sailor man, so that I
      think there must have been a time when he knew more of the poop
      than the forecastle. For a month he was in and out of my house,
      and never once did it cross my mind that harm might come of his
      soft, tricky ways. And then at last something made me suspect,
      and from that day my peace was gone forever.
