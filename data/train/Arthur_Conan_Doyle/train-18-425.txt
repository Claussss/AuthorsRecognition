There was some little similarity between the two, for the man was a
towsy-headed fellow with a great mop of yellow hair and a straggling
beard, while the dog was of the long-haired, unkempt breed looking like
an animated bundle of oakum. All our way to the Hall its owner kept retailing instances of the
creature's sagacity and powers of scent, which, according to his
account, were little less than miraculous. His anecdotes had a poor
audience, I fear, for my mind was filled with the strange story which I
had been reading, while Mordaunt strode on with wild eyes and feverish
cheeks, without a thought for anything but the problem which we had to
solve.
