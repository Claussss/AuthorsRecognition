So much for the top line, concerning which I have already gossipped
for six sittings, but there is no surcease for you, reader, for as
you see there is a second line, and yet a third, all equally dear to
my heart, and all appealing in the same degree to my emotions and
to my memory. Be as patient as you may, while I talk of these old
friends, and tell you why I love them, and all that they have meant
to me in the past. If you picked any book from that line you would
be picking a little fibre also from my mind, very small, no doubt,
and yet an intimate and essential part of what is now myself.
Hereditary impulses, personal experiences, books--those are the
three forces which go to the making of man. These are the books.
