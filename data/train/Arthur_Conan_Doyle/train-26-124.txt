Reade is one of the most perplexing figures in our literature. Never
was there a man so hard to place. At his best he is the best we
have. At his worst he is below the level of Surreyside melodrama.
But his best have weak pieces, and his worst have good. There is
always silk among his cotton, and cotton among his silk. But, for
all his flaws, the man who, in addition to the great book, of which
I have already spoken, wrote "It is Never Too Late to Mend," "Hard
Cash," "Foul Play," and "Griffith Gaunt," must always stand in the
very first rank of our novelists.
