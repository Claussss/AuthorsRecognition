Under that frightful impact horses fell dead with broken necks, and many
a rider, held in his saddle by the high pommel, fractured his thighs
with the shock. Here and there a pair met breast to breast, the horses
rearing straight upward and falling back upon their masters. But for the
most part the line had opened in the gallop, and the cavaliers, flying
through the gaps, buried themselves in the enemy's ranks. Then the
flanks shredded out, and the thick press in the center loosened until
there was space to swing a sword and to guide a steed. For ten acres
there was one wild tumultuous swirl of tossing heads, of gleaming
weapons which rose and fell, of upthrown hands, of tossing plumes and
of lifted shields, whilst the din of a thousand war-cries and the
clash-clash of metal upon metal rose and swelled like the roar and beat
of an ocean surge upon a rock-bound coast. Backward and forward swayed
the mighty throng, now down the valley and now up, as each side in turn
put forth its strength for a fresh rally. Locked in one long deadly
grapple, great England and gallant France with iron hearts and souls of
fire strove and strove for mastery.
