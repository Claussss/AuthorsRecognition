But there was little rest for the victors. Whilst the knights had
charged them in front the slingers had crept round upon either flank and
had gained a footing upon the cliffs and behind the outlying rocks.
A storm of stones broke suddenly upon the defenders, who, drawn up in
lines upon the exposed summit, offered a fair mark to their hidden
foes. Johnston, the old archer, was struck upon the temple and fell dead
without a groan, while fifteen of his bowmen and six of the men-at-arms
were struck down at the same moment. The others lay on their faces to
avoid the deadly hail, while at each side of the plateau a fringe of
bowmen exchanged shots with the slingers and crossbowmen among the
rocks, aiming mainly at those who had swarmed up the cliffs, and
bursting into laughter and cheers when a well-aimed shaft brought one of
their opponents toppling down from his lofty perch.
