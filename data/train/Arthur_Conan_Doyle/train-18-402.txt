October 6, 11 A.M.--Let me try to set down as calmly and as accurately
as I can all that occurred last night. I have never been a dreamer or
a visionary, so I can rely upon my own senses, though I am bound to
say that if any other fellow had told me the same thing I should have
doubted him. I might even have suspected that I was deceived at the time
had I not heard the bell since. However, I must narrate what happened.
