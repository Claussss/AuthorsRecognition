‘Say no more of it,’ I answered, ‘if you will but guard against such
impulses for the future.’ ‘They do not properly come from me,’ he replied, ‘but from Will
Spotterbridge, who was a man of no character at all.’ ‘And how comes he to be mixed up in the matter?’ I asked curiously. ‘Why, marry, in this wise. My father married the daughter of this same
Will Spotterbridge, and so weakened a good old stock by an unhealthy
strain. Will was a rake-hell of Fleet Street in the days of James, a
chosen light of Alsatia, the home of bullies and of brawlers. His blood
hath through his daughter been transmitted to the ten of us, though I
rejoice to say that I, being the tenth, it had by that time lost much
of its virulence, and indeed amounts to little more than a proper pride,
and a laudable desire to prosper.’
