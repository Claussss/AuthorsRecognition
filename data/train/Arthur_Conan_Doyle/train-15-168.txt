That same night Severus Alexander, the young Syrian Emperor, walked
outside his Prætorian camp, accompanied by his friend Licinius Probus,
the Captain of the Guard. They were talking gravely of the gloomy faces
and seditious bearing of the soldiers. A great foreboding of evil
weighed heavily upon the Emperor's heart, and it was reflected upon the
stern bearded face of his companion. "I like it not," said he. "It is my counsel, Cæsar, that with the first
light of morning we make our way south once more."
