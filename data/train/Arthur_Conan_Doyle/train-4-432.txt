‘Shoulder scythe, port scythe, present scythe--mow!’ whispered Reuben to
Sir Gervas, and the pair began to laugh, heedless of the angry frowns of
Saxon. ‘Let us divide them,’ he said, ‘into three companies of eighty men. Or
stay--how many musketeers have we in all? Five-and-fifty. Let them stand
forward, and form the first line or company. Sir Gervas Jerome, you have
officered the militia of your county, and have doubtless some knowledge
of the manual exercise. If I am commandant of this force I hand over the
captaincy of this company to you. It shall be the first line in battle,
a position which I know you will not be averse to.’
