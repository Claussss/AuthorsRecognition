      “We had no clue in the Acton affair. But here we have plenty to
      go on, and there’s no doubt it is the same party in each case.
      The man was seen.”       “Ah!”       “Yes, sir. But he was off like a deer after the shot that killed
      poor William Kirwan was fired. Mr. Cunningham saw him from the
      bedroom window, and Mr. Alec Cunningham saw him from the back
      passage. It was quarter to twelve when the alarm broke out. Mr.
      Cunningham had just got into bed, and Mr. Alec was smoking a pipe
      in his dressing-gown. They both heard William the coachman
      calling for help, and Mr. Alec ran down to see what was the
      matter. The back door was open, and as he came to the foot of the
      stairs he saw two men wrestling together outside. One of them
      fired a shot, the other dropped, and the murderer rushed across
      the garden and over the hedge. Mr. Cunningham, looking out of his
      bedroom, saw the fellow as he gained the road, but lost sight of
      him at once. Mr. Alec stopped to see if he could help the dying
      man, and so the villain got clean away. Beyond the fact that he
      was a middle-sized man and dressed in some dark stuff, we have no
      personal clue; but we are making energetic inquiries, and if he
      is a stranger we shall soon find him out.”
