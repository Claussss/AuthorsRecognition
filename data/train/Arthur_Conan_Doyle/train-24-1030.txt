that same peasant had a sour face and a shifting eye, as one who bore us
little good will. I doubt not that he has brought these cavaliers upon

ride through the further end of the pass.” “Were we a troop of mountain goats we might do so,” answered Sir William
Felton, “but it is not to be passed by a company of horsemen. If these
be indeed Don Tello and his men, then we must bide where we are, and do
what we can to make them rue the day that they found us in their path.”
