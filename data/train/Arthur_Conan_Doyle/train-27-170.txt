'What are you doing?' he asked gruffly. 'You mustn't read at meals, Archibald. It's bad manners, and bad for your
digestion.' 'I've read the news at breakfast all my life, and I shall do so still,'
exclaimed the husband, starting up and recovering his paper. 'Then you will have breakfast by yourself. Nelly, we must go into the
other room till papa has finished.' Mr. Jordan ate mechanically, and stared at the newspaper with just as
little consciousness. Prompted by the underlying weakness of his
character to yield for the sake of peace, wrath made him dogged, and the
more steadily he regarded his position, the more was he appalled by the
outlook. Why, this meant downright slavery! He had married a woman so
horribly like himself in several points that his only hope lay in
overcoming her by sheer violence. A thoroughly good and well-meaning
woman, an excellent housekeeper, the kind of wife to do him credit and
improve his social position; but self-willed, pertinacious, and probably
thinking herself his superior in every respect. He had nothing to fear
but subjection--the one thing he had never anticipated, the one thing he
could never endure.
