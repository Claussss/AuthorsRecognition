The Mardens left this morning, and the brightness seems to have gone
out of the spring sunshine.  And yet it is very beautiful also as it
gleams on the green chestnuts opposite my windows, and gives a touch of
gayety to the heavy, lichen-mottled walls of the old colleges.  How
sweet and gentle and soothing is Nature!  Who would think that there
lurked in her also such vile forces, such odious possibilities!  For of
course I understand that this dreadful thing which has sprung out at me
is neither supernatural nor even preternatural.  No, it is a natural
force which this woman can use and society is ignorant of.  The mere
fact that it ebbs with her strength shows how entirely it is subject to
physical laws.  If I had time, I might probe it to the bottom and lay
my hands upon its antidote.  But you cannot tame the tiger when you are
beneath his claws.  You can but try to writhe away from him.  Ah, when
I look in the glass and see my own dark eyes and clear-cut Spanish
face, I long for a vitriol splash or a bout of the small-pox.  One or
the other might have saved me from this calamity.
