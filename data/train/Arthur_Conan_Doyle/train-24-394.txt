The Lady Mary Loring slipped her hand from her yellow leather gauntlet,
and he, lifting it with dainty reverence, bound it to the front of his
velvet cap. “It is with mine other guardian angels,” quoth he, pointing at the
saints' medals which hung beside it. “And now, my dearest, you have come
far enow. May the Virgin guard and prosper thee! One kiss!” He bent down
from his saddle, and then, striking spurs into his horse's sides, he
galloped at top speed after his men, with his three squires at his
heels. Half a mile further, where the road topped a hill, they looked
back, and the Lady Mary on her white palfrey was still where they had
left her. A moment later they were on the downward slope, and she had
vanished from their view.
