‘Bring the prisoner forward to the fire! Now, hark ye, dog of a
land-shark; you are as surely a dead man as though you were laid out
with the tapers burning. See here’--he lifted a torch, and showed by
its red light a great crack in the floor across the far end of the
cave--‘you can judge of the Black Drop’s depth!’ he said, raising an
empty keg and tossing it over into the yawning gulf. For ten seconds
we stood silent before a dull distant clatter told that it had at last
reached the bottom.
