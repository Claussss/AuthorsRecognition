‘I am serving under King Monmouth,’ I answered, seeing that the proposed
search must end in the finding of my papers. ‘Under King Monmouth!’ cried the smuggler. ‘Nay, friend, that rings
somewhat false. The good King hath, I hear, too much need of his friends
in the south to let an able soldier go wandering along the sea coast
like a Cornish wrecker in a sou’-wester.’ ‘I bear despatches,’ said I, ‘from the King’s own hand to Henry Duke
of Beaufort, at his castle at Badminton. Ye can find them in my inner
pocket, but I pray ye not to break the seal, lest it bring discredit
upon my mission.’
