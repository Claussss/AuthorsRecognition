Spanish barranca. A blue heaven stretched above, a green rolling plain
undulated below, intersected with hedge-rows and flecked with grazing
sheep. The sun was yet low in the heaven, and the red cows stood in the

dipped and curved away back to where the towers and pinnacles beneath
the flat-topped hill marked the old town of Winchester.
