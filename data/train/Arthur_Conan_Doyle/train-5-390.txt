"I don't know.  I heard him cry out.  I ran up.  I know him pretty
well, you know.  It is very good of you to come down." "His heart is going like a pair of castanets," said Smith, laying his
hand on the breast of the unconscious man.  "He seems to me to be
frightened all to pieces.  Chuck the water over him!  What a face he
has got on him!" It was indeed a strange and most repellent face, for colour and outline
were equally unnatural.  It was white, not with the ordinary pallor of
fear but with an absolutely bloodless white, like the under side of a
sole.  He was very fat, but gave the impression of having at some time
been considerably fatter, for his skin hung loosely in creases and
folds, and was shot with a meshwork of wrinkles.  Short, stubbly brown
hair bristled up from his scalp, with a pair of thick, wrinkled ears
protruding on either side.  His light grey eyes were still open, the
pupils dilated and the balls projecting in a fixed and horrid stare.
It seemed to Smith as he looked down upon him that he had never seen
nature's danger signals flying so plainly upon a man's countenance, and
his thoughts turned more seriously to the warning which Hastie had
given him an hour before.
