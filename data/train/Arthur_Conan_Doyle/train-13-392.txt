      â€œI confess that so far, Watson, I had been disappointed in my
      investigation. I had reckoned upon solving the matter when once I
      had found the place referred to in the Ritual; but now I was
      there, and was apparently as far as ever from knowing what it was
      which the family had concealed with such elaborate precautions.
      It is true that I had thrown a light upon the fate of Brunton,
      but now I had to ascertain how that fate had come upon him, and
      what part had been played in the matter by the woman who had
      disappeared. I sat down upon a keg in the corner and thought the
      whole matter carefully over.
