"Yes, I was just going to tell you.  I heard of your coming, but I
couldn't get round before----"  He broke into a nervous little cough. "Yes?" said the doctor encouragingly. "I should have been here three weeks ago, but you know how these things
get put off."  He coughed again behind his large red hand. "I do not think that you need say anything more," said the doctor,
taking over the case with an easy air of command.  "Your cough is quite
sufficient.  It is entirely bronchial by the sound.  No doubt the
mischief is circumscribed at present, but there is always the danger
that it may spread, so you have done wisely to come to me.  A little
judicious treatment will soon set you right.  Your waistcoat, please,
but not your shirt.  Puff out your chest and say ninety-nine in a deep
voice."
