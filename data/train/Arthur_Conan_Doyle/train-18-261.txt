“She was a leaky old craft,” said the captain, looking sadly out to sea,
“but there's always a feeling of sorrow when we see the last of a ship
we have sailed in. Well, well, she would have been broken up in any
case, and sold for firewood.” “It looks a peaceful scene,” I remarked. “Who would imagine that three
men lost their lives last night in those very waters?” “Poor fellows,” said the captain, with feeling. “Should they be cast
up after our departure, I am sure, Mr. West, that you will have them
decently interred.”
