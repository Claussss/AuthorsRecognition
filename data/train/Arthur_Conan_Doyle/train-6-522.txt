The archer balanced himself in the rolling boat with the deftness of a
man who has been trained upon the sea, for he was born and bred in
the Cinque Ports. Carefully he nocked his arrow, strongly he drew it,
steadily he loosed it, but the boat swooped at the instant, and it
buried itself in the waves. The second passed over the little ship, and
the third struck in her black side. Then in quick succession so quick
that two shafts were often in the air at the same instant--he discharged
a dozen arrows, most of which just cleared the bulwarks and dropped upon
the deck. There was a cry on the Frenchman, and the heads vanished from
the side.
