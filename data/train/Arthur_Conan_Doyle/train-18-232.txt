Suddenly, however, a light glimmered in the heart of the tempest, and
next instant the beach and sea and wide, tossing bay were brilliantly
illuminated by the wild glare of a signal light. The ship lay on her beam-ends right in the centre of the terrible Hansel
reef, hurled over to such an angle that I could see all the planking of
her deck. I recognised her at once as being the same three-masted barque
which I had observed in the Channel in the morning, and the Union
Jack which was nailed upside down to the jagged slump of her mizzen
proclaimed her nationality.
