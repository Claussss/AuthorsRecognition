“They are unarmed.” “Then admit them and bring them hither, but double the guards and take
all heed against surprise.” Places were set at the farther end of the table for these most
unexpected guests. Presently the door was swung open, and Croquart with
all form and courtesy announced the two Bretons, who entered with the
proud and lofty air of gallant warriors and high-bred gentlemen. Beaumanoir was a tall dark man with raven hair and long swarthy beard.
He was strong and straight as a young oak, with fiery black eyes, and
no flaw in his comely features save that his front teeth had been dashed
from their sockets. His Squire, William of Montaubon, was also tall,
with a thin hatchet face, and two small gray eyes set very close upon
either side of a long fierce nose. In Beaumanoir's expression one read
only gallantry and frankness; in Montaubon's there was gallantry also,
but it was mixed with the cruelty and cunning of the wolf. They bowed
as they entered, and the little English seneschal advanced with
outstretched hand to meet them.
