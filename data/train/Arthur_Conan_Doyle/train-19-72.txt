"I think so, too, dear." "And for Miss Penclosa's nerves as well.  You have heard that she is
ill?" "Mrs. Wilson told us so last night.  She described it as a nervous
fever. Professor Wilson is coming back this week, and of course Mrs.
Wilson is very anxious that Miss Penclosa should be well again then,
for he has quite a programme of experiments which he is anxious to
carry out." I was glad to have Agatha's promise, for it was enough that this woman
should have one of us in her clutch.  On the other hand, I was
disturbed to hear about Miss Penclosa's illness.  It rather discounts
the victory which I appeared to win last night.  I remember that she
said that loss of health interfered with her power.  That may be why I
was able to hold my own so easily.  Well, well, I must take the same
precautions to-night and see what comes of it.  I am childishly
frightened when I think of her.
