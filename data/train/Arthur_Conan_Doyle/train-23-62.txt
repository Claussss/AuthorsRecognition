The revelation abolishes the idea of a grotesque hell and of a
fantastic heaven, while it substitutes the conception of a gradual rise
in the scale of existence without any monstrous change which would turn
us in an instant from man to angel or devil.  The system, though
different from previous ideas, does not, as it seems to me, run counter
in any radical fashion to the old beliefs.  In ancient maps it was
usual for the cartographer to mark blank spaces for the unexplored
regions, with some such legend as "here are anthropophagi," or "here
are mandrakes," scrawled across them.  So in our theology there have
been ill-defined areas which have admittedly been left unfilled, for
what sane man has ever believed in such a heaven as is depicted in our
hymn books, a land of musical idleness and barren monotonous adoration!
Thus in furnishing a clearer conception this new system has nothing to
supplant.  It paints upon a blank sheet.
