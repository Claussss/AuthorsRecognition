      “I’ll tell you what I did first, and how I came to do it
      afterwards,” said he. “After leaving you at the station I went
      for a charming walk through some admirable Surrey scenery to a
      pretty little village called Ripley, where I had my tea at an
      inn, and took the precaution of filling my flask and of putting a
      paper of sandwiches in my pocket. There I remained until evening,
      when I set off for Woking again, and found myself in the
      high-road outside Briarbrae just after sunset.
