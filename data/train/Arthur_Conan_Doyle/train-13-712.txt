      “Your name is very familiar to me, Mr. Holmes,” said he, smiling.
      “And, of course, I cannot pretend to be ignorant of the object of
      your visit. There has only been one occurrence in these offices
      which could call for your attention. In whose interest are you
      acting, may I ask?”       “In that of Mr. Percy Phelps,” answered Holmes.       “Ah, my unfortunate nephew! You can understand that our kinship
      makes it the more impossible for me to screen him in any way. I
      fear that the incident must have a very prejudicial effect upon
      his career.”
