By the way, talking of Napoleon's flight from Egypt, did you ever
see a curious little book called, if I remember right, "Intercepted
Letters"? No; I have no copy upon this shelf, but a friend is more
fortunate. It shows the almost incredible hatred which existed
at the end of the eighteenth century between the two nations,
descending even to the most petty personal annoyance. On this
occasion the British Government intercepted a mail-bag of letters
coming from French officers in Egypt to their friends at home,
and they either published them, or at least allowed them to be
published, in the hope, no doubt, of causing domestic complications.
Was ever a more despicable action? But who knows what other injuries
had been inflicted to draw forth such a retaliation? I have myself
seen a burned and mutilated British mail lying where De Wet had left
it; but suppose the refinement of his vengeance had gone so far as
to publish it, what a thunder-bolt it might have been!
