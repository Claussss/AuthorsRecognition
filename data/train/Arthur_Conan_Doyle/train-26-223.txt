Talking of popular science, I know no better books for exciting a
man's first interest, and giving a broad general view of the
subject, than these of Samuel Laing. Who would have imagined that
the wise savant and gentle dreamer of these volumes was also the
energetic secretary of a railway company? Many men of the highest
scientific eminence have begun in prosaic lines of life. Herbert
Spencer was a railway engineer. Wallace was a land surveyor. But
that a man with so pronounced a scientific brain as Laing should
continue all his life to devote his time to dull routine work,
remaining in harness until extreme old age, with his soul still
open to every fresh idea and his brain acquiring new concretions
of knowledge, is indeed a remarkable fact. Read those books, and
you will be a fuller man.
