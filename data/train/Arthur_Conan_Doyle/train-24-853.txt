“I would not give overmuch thought to it,” answered Alleyne. “Our minds
will play us strange pranks, and bethink you that these words of the
Lady Tiphaine Du Guesclin have wrought upon us and shaken us.” Ford shook his head. “I saw little Tita as clearly as though I were back
at the Rue des Apotres at Bordeaux,” said he. “But the hour is late, and
I must go.” “Where do you sleep, then?” “In the chamber above you. May the saints be with us all!” He rose
from the couch and left the chamber, while Alleyne could hear his feet
sounding upon the winding stair. The young squire walked across to the
window and gazed out at the moonlit landscape, his mind absorbed by
the thought of the Lady Tiphaine, and of the strange words that she
had spoken as to what was going forward at Castle Twynham. Leaning his
elbows upon the stonework, he was deeply plunged in reverie, when in a
moment his thoughts were brought back to Villefranche and to the scene
before him.
