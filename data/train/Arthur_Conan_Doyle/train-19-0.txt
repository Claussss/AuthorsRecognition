nature readjusts the whole machine.  I can feel the ferment in my blood
at this very moment, and as the cool sunshine pours through my window I

Sadler would rush upstairs to know what was the matter.  Besides, I
must remember that I am Professor Gilroy.  An old professor may afford
to be natural, but when fortune has given one of the first chairs in
the university to a man of four-and-thirty he must try and act the part
consistently.
