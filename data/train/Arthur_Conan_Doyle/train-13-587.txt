      “My dear Watson,” said he, “I cannot agree with those who rank
      modesty among the virtues. To the logician all things should be
      seen exactly as they are, and to underestimate one’s self is as
      much a departure from truth as to exaggerate one’s own powers.
      When I say, therefore, that Mycroft has better powers of
      observation than I, you may take it that I am speaking the exact
      and literal truth.”
