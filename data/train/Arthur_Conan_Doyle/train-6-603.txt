It took them four days of hard work ere their preparations were
complete, for many were the needs of a small force sailing to a strange
country. Three ships had been left to them, the cog Thomas of Romney,
the Grace Dieu of Hythe, and the Basilisk of Southampton, into each of
which one hundred men were stowed, besides the thirty seamen who formed
the crew. In the hold were forty horses, amongst them Pommers, much
wearied by his long idleness, and homesick for the slopes of Surrey
where his great limbs might find the work he craved. Then the food and
the water, the bow-staves and the sheaves of arrows, the horseshoes, the
nails, the hammers, the knives, the axes, the ropes, the vats of hay,
the green fodder and a score of other things were packed aboard. Always
by the side of the ships stood the stern young knight Sir Robert,
checking, testing, watching and controlling, saying little, for he was a
man of few words, but with his eyes, his hands, and if need be his heavy
dog-whip, wherever they were wanted.
