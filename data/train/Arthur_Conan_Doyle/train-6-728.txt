Pommers had met his match that day. The white horse, two parts Arab,
bore the lighter weight, since Nigel was clad in full armor. For five
miles over the open neither gained a hundred yards upon the other.
They had topped the hill and flew down the farther side, the stranger
continually turning in his saddle to have a look at his pursuer. There
was no panic in his flight, but rather the amused rivalry with which
a good horseman who is proud of his mount contends with one who has
challenged him. Below the hill was a marshy plain, studded with great
Druidic stones, some prostrate, some erect, some bearing others across
their tops like the huge doors of some vanished building. A path ran
through the marsh with green rushes as a danger signal on either side of
it. Across this path many of the huge stones were lying, but the white
horse cleared them in its stride and Pommers followed close upon his
heels. Then came a mile of soft ground where the lighter weight again
drew to the front, but it ended in a dry upland and once again Nigel
gained. A sunken road crossed it, but the white cleared it with a mighty
spring, and again the yellow followed. Two small hills lay before them
with a narrow gorge of deep bushes between. Nigel saw the white horse
bounding chest-deep amid the underwood.
