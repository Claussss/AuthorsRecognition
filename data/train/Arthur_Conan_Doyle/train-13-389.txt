      â€œAt my suggestion a couple of the county police were summoned to
      be present, and I then endeavoured to raise the stone by pulling
      on the cravat. I could only move it slightly, and it was with the
      aid of one of the constables that I succeeded at last in carrying
      it to one side. A black hole yawned beneath into which we all
      peered, while Musgrave, kneeling at the side, pushed down the
      lantern.
