‘Nay, gentlemen,’ cried the under officer. ‘This quarrel must not
continue here. We must have no brawling within the prison. Yet there is
a level turf without, and as fine elbow-room as a gentleman could wish
for a breather.’ This proposal did not appear to commend itself to either of the angry
gentlemen, who proceeded to exchange the length of their swords, and to
promise that each should hear from the other before sunset. Our owner,
as I may call him, the fop, took his departure at last, and the country
squire having chosen the next ton swaggered off, cursing the courtiers,
the Londoners, the sergeant, the prisoners, and above all, the
ingratitude of the Government which had made him so small a return
for his exertions. This was but the first of many such scenes, for the
Government, in endeavouring to satisfy the claims of its supporters, had
promised many more than there were prisoners. I am grieved to say that
I have seen not only men, but even my own countrywomen, and ladies of
title to boot, wringing their hands and bewailing themselves because
they were unable to get any of the poor Somersetshire folk to sell as
slaves. Indeed, it was only with difficulty that they could be made
to see that their claim upon Government did not give them the right of
seizing any burgher or peasant who might come in their way, and shipping
him right off for the Plantations.
