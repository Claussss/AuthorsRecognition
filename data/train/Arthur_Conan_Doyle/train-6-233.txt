VIII. HOW THE KING HAWKED ON CROOKSBURY HEATH 
The King and his attendants had shaken off the crowd who had followed
them from Guildford along the Pilgrims' Way and now, the mounted archers
having beaten off the more persistent of the spectators, they rode
at their ease in a long, straggling, glittering train over the dark
undulating plain of heather. In the van was the King himself, for his hawks were with him and he had
some hope of sport. Edward at that time was a well-grown, vigorous man
in the very prime of his years, a keen sportsman, an ardent gallant
and a chivalrous soldier. He was a scholar too, speaking Latin, French,
German, Spanish, and even a little English.
