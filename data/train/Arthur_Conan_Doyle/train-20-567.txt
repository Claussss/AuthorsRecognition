      “To-day, about three o’clock, the proofs of this paper arrived
      from the printers. The exercise consists of half a chapter of
      Thucydides. I had to read it over carefully, as the text must be
      absolutely correct. At four-thirty my task was not yet completed.
      I had, however, promised to take tea in a friend’s rooms, so I
      left the proof upon my desk. I was absent rather more than an
      hour.
