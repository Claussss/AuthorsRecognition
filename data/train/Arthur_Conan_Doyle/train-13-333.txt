      “‘The state-room was next the cabin, and we flocked in there and
      flopped down on the settees, all speaking together, for we were
      just mad with the feeling that we were free once more. There were
      lockers all round, and Wilson, the sham chaplain, knocked one of
      them in, and pulled out a dozen of brown sherry. We cracked off
      the necks of the bottles, poured the stuff out into tumblers, and
      were just tossing them off, when in an instant without warning
      there came the roar of muskets in our ears, and the saloon was so
      full of smoke that we could not see across the table. When it
      cleared again the place was a shambles. Wilson and eight others
      were wriggling on the top of each other on the floor, and the
      blood and the brown sherry on that table turn me sick now when I
      think of it. We were so cowed by the sight that I think we should
      have given the job up if it had not been for Prendergast. He
      bellowed like a bull and rushed for the door with all that were
      left alive at his heels. Out we ran, and there on the poop were
      the lieutenant and ten of his men. The swing skylights above the
      saloon table had been a bit open, and they had fired on us
      through the slit. We got on them before they could load, and they
      stood to it like men; but we had the upper hand of them, and in
      five minutes it was all over. My God! Was there ever a
      slaughter-house like that ship! Prendergast was like a raging
      devil, and he picked the soldiers up as if they had been children
      and threw them overboard alive or dead. There was one sergeant
      that was horribly wounded and yet kept on swimming for a
      surprising time, until some one in mercy blew out his brains.
      When the fighting was over there was no one left of our enemies
      except just the warders, the mates, and the doctor.
