      “These theories take no account of the telegram.”       “Quite true, Watson. The telegram still remains the only solid
      thing with which we have to deal, and we must not permit our
      attention to wander away from it. It is to gain light upon the
      purpose of this telegram that we are now upon our way to
      Cambridge. The path of our investigation is at present obscure,
      but I shall be very much surprised if before evening we have not
      cleared it up, or made a considerable advance along it.”
