Clever as he undoubtedly was, however, the medical student seemed to
detect a dash of insanity in the man.  He broke out at times into a
high, inflated style of talk which was in contrast with the simplicity
of his life. "It is a wonderful thing," he cried, "to feel that one can command
powers of good and of evil--a ministering angel or a demon of
vengeance."  And again, of Monkhouse Lee, he said,--"Lee is a good
fellow, an honest fellow, but he is without strength or ambition.  He
would not make a fit partner for a man with a great enterprise.  He
would not make a fit partner for me."
