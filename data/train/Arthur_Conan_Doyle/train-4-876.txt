‘Your bedside!’ I exclaimed. ‘Aye! it was the mode to receive in bed, attired in laced cambric

is a terrible tyrant, Clarke, though its arm may not extend as far as
Havant. The idle man of the town must have some rule of life, so he
becomes a slave to the law of the fashions. No man in London was more

case of want among them, some needy man-of-letters in quest of a guinea,
