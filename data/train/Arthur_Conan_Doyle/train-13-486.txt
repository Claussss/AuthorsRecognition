      “Now for the events at Lachine between nine and ten on the
      evening of last Monday.”       “Mrs. Barclay was, it appears, a member of the Roman Catholic
      Church, and had interested herself very much in the establishment
      of the Guild of St. George, which was formed in connection with
      the Watt Street Chapel for the purpose of supplying the poor with
      cast-off clothing. A meeting of the Guild had been held that
      evening at eight, and Mrs. Barclay had hurried over her dinner in
      order to be present at it. When leaving the house she was heard
      by the coachman to make some commonplace remark to her husband,
      and to assure him that she would be back before very long. She
      then called for Miss Morrison, a young lady who lives in the next
      villa, and the two went off together to their meeting. It lasted
      forty minutes, and at a quarter-past nine Mrs. Barclay returned
      home, having left Miss Morrison at her door as she passed.
