“You are a private individual. You have no warrant for my arrest. The
whole proceeding is absolutely illegal and outrageous.” “Absolutely,” said Holmes. “Kidnapping a German subject.” “And stealing his private papers.” “Well, you realise your position, you and your accomplice here. If I
were to shout for help as we pass through the village—” “My dear sir, if you did anything so foolish you would probably enlarge
the two limited titles of our village inns by giving us ‘The Dangling
Prussian’ as a signpost. The Englishman is a patient creature, but at
present his temper is a little inflamed, and it would be as well not to
try him too far. No, Mr. Von Bork, you will go with us in a quiet,
sensible fashion to Scotland Yard, whence you can send for your friend,
Baron Von Herling, and see if even now you may not fill that place
which he has reserved for you in the ambassadorial suite. As to you,
Watson, you are joining us with your old service, as I understand, so
London won’t be out of your way. Stand with me here upon the terrace,
for it may be the last quiet talk that we shall ever have.”
