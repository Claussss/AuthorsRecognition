“They're coming!” cried Belmont, looking over the plain. “Let them come!” the Colonel answered, putting his hands into his
trouser-pockets. Suddenly he pulled one fist out, and shook it furiously
in the air. “Oh, the cads! the confounded cads!” he shouted, and his
eyes were congested with rage. It was the fate of the poor donkey-boys which had carried the
self-contained soldier out of his usual calm. During the firing they had
remained huddled, a pitiable group, among the rocks at the base of the
hill. Now upon the conviction that the charge of the Dervishes must
come first upon them, they had sprung upon their animals with shrill,
inarticulate cries of fear, and had galloped off across the plain. A
small flanking-party of eight or ten camel-men had worked round while
the firing had been going on, and these dashed in among the flying
donkey-boys, hacking and hewing with a cold-blooded, deliberate
ferocity. One little boy, in a flapping Galabeeah, kept ahead of his
pursuers for a time, but the long stride of the camels ran him down,
and an Arab thrust his spear into the middle of his stooping back. The
small, white-clad corpses looked like a flock of sheep trailing over the
desert.
