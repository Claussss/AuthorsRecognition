Robert lit the weed which was offered to him, and leaned back
luxuriously amid his cushions, gazing through the blue balmy fragrant
cloud-wreaths at the extraordinary man in the dirty pea-jacket who spoke
of millions as another might of sovereigns. With his pale face, his sad,
languid air, and his bowed shoulders, it was as though he were crushed
down under the weight of his own gold. There was a mute apology, an
attitude of deprecation in his manner and speech, which was strangely
at variance with the immense power which he wielded. To Robert the
whole whimsical incident had been intensely interesting and amusing. His
artistic nature blossomed out in this atmosphere of perfect luxury
and comfort, and he was conscious of a sense of repose and of absolute
sensual contentment such as he had never before experienced.
