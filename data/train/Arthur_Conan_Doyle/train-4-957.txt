‘You sell milk,’ said Reuben. ‘We are tired and thirsty, so we have come
to have a horn of it.’ ‘Nay,’ she cried, breaking into smiles, ‘will ye pay me just as the folk
pay granny? Oh, heart alive! but that will be fine!’ She skipped up
on to a stool and filled a pair of deep mugs from the basins upon the
table. ‘A penny, please!’ said she. It was strange to see the little wife hide the coin away in her smock,
with pride and joy in her innocent face at this rare stroke of business
which she had done for her absent granny. We bore our milk away to the
window, and having loosed the shutters we seated ourselves so as to have
an outlook down the road.
