      â€œAll the time that she was telling me this story she never once
      looked in my direction, and her voice was quite unlike her usual
      tones. It was evident to me that she was saying what was false. I
      said nothing in reply, but turned my face to the wall, sick at
      heart, with my mind filled with a thousand venomous doubts and
      suspicions. What was it that my wife was concealing from me?
      Where had she been during that strange expedition? I felt that I
      should have no peace until I knew, and yet I shrank from asking
      her again after once she had told me what was false. All the rest
      of the night I tossed and tumbled, framing theory after theory,
      each more unlikely than the last.
