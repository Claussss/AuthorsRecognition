“Stand back, Swire!” she cried. “Back, Weathercote Charles, put a
leash on Talbot, and hold Bayard back!” Her black eyes blazed upon the
invaders until they shrank from that baleful gaze. “Who are you, you
rascal robbers, who dare to misuse the King's name and to lay hands upon
one whose smallest drop of blood has more worth than all your thrall and
caitiff bodies?” “Nay, not so fast, dame, not so fast, I pray you!” cried the stout
summoner, whose face had resumed its natural color, now that he had a
woman to deal with. “There is a law of England, mark you, and there are
those who serve and uphold it, who are the true men and the King's own
lieges. Such a one am I. Then again, there are those who take such as
me and transfer, carry or convey us into a bog or morass. Such a one is
this graceless old man with the ax, whom I have seen already this day.
There are also those who tear, destroy or scatter the papers of the law,
of which this young man is the chief. Therefore, I would rede you, dame,
not to rail against us, but to understand that we are the King's men on
the King's own service.”
