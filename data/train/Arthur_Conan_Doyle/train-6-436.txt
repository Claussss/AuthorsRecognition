“By Saint Paul!” said Nigel, tugging at his bridle and white with anger,
“they shall not chase me across the country as though I was a frighted
doe. Archer, how dare you to lash my horse when I would have turned and
ridden in upon them?” “It is well that I did so,” said Aylward, “or by these ten finger-bones!
our journey would have begun and ended on the same day. As I glanced
round I saw a dozen of them at the least amongst the brushwood. See now
how the light glimmers upon their steel caps yonder in the bracken
under the great beech-tree. Nay, I pray you, my fair lord, do not ride
forward. What chance has a man in the open against all these who lie
at their ease in the underwood? If you will not think of yourself, then
consider your horse, which would have a cloth-yard shaft feathered in
its hide ere it could reach the wood.”
