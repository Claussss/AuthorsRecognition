“If it please your majesty,” said he, “we are of opinion that this
Squire hath exceeded all bounds in desiring to break a spear with a
belted knight ere he has given his proofs. We do him sufficient honor
if a Squire ride against him, and with your consent I have chosen my
own body-squire, John Widdicombe, to clear the path for us across the
bridge.” “What you say, Walter, is right and fair,” said the King. “Master
Chandos, you will tell our champion yonder what hath been arranged. You
will advise him also that it is our royal will that this contest be not
fought upon the bridge, since it is very clear that it must end in one
or both going over into the river, but that he advance to the end of the
bridge and fight upon the plain. You will tell him also that a blunted
lance is sufficient for such an encounter, but that a hand-stroke or
two with sword or mace may well be exchanged, if both riders should keep
their saddles. A blast upon Raoul's horn shall be the signal to close.”
