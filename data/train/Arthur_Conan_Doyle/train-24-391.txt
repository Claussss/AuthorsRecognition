“Nay, my heart's life,” the little knight interrupted, “trouble not now
about such matters. Why so pale and wan, Edricson? Is it not enow
to make a man's heart dance to see this noble Company, such valiant
men-at-arms, such lusty archers? By St. Paul! I would be ill to please
if I were not blithe to see the red roses flying at the head of so noble
a following!” “The purse I have already given you, Edricson,” continued the lady.
“There are in it twenty-three marks, one noble, three shillings and
fourpence, which is a great treasure for one man to carry. And I pray
you to bear in mind, Edricson, that he hath two pair of shoes, those of
red leather for common use, and the others with golden toe-chains,
which he may wear should he chance to drink wine with the Prince or with
Chandos.”
