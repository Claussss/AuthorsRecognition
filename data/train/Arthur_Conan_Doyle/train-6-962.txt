“'Fore God, I knew it!” cried the Duke of Orleans in a voice of fury.
“Whilst we have been talking they have slipped through our fingers. Did
I not warn you?” “Be silent, Philip!” said the King angrily. “But you, sir, have you seen
this with your own eyes?” “With my own eyes, sire, and I have ridden straight from their camp.” King John looked at him with a stern gaze. “I know not how it accords
with your honor to carry such tidings in such a fashion,” said he; “but
we cannot choose but take advantage of it. Fear not, brother Philip,
it is in my mind that you will see all that you would wish of the
Englishmen before nightfall. Should we fall upon them whilst they cross
the ford it will be to our advantage. Now, fair sirs, I pray you to
hasten to your posts and to carry out all that we have agreed. Advance
the oriflamme, Geoffrey, and do you marshal the divisions, Arnold. So
may God and Saint Denis have us in their holy keeping this day!”
