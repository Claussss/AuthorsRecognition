      “And now the matter had begun to straighten itself out
      wonderfully. We had learned of the existence of this steward, an
      impulsive man, of strong passions—you remember that he threw up
      what must have been a very superior berth in order to be nearer
      to his wife—subject, too, to occasional fits of hard drinking. We
      had reason to believe that his wife had been murdered, and that a
      man—presumably a seafaring man—had been murdered at the same
      time. Jealousy, of course, at once suggests itself as the motive
      for the crime. And why should these proofs of the deed be sent to
      Miss Sarah Cushing? Probably because during her residence in
      Liverpool she had some hand in bringing about the events which
      led to the tragedy. You will observe that this line of boats
      calls at Belfast, Dublin, and Waterford; so that, presuming that
      Browner had committed the deed and had embarked at once upon his
      steamer, the _May Day_, Belfast would be the first place at which
      he could post his terrible packet.
