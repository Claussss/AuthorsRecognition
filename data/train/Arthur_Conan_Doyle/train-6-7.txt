For the rain had ceased at last, and a sickly autumn sun shone upon
a land which was soaked and sodden with water. Wet and rotten leaves
reeked and festered under the foul haze which rose from the woods.
The fields were spotted with monstrous fungi of a size and color never
matched before--scarlet and mauve and liver and black. It was as though
the sick earth had burst into foul pustules; mildew and lichen mottled
the walls, and with that filthy crop Death sprang also from the
water-soaked earth. Men died, and women and children, the baron of the
castle, the franklin on the farm, the monk in the abbey and the villein
in his wattle-and-daub cottage. All breathed the same polluted reek and
all died the same death of corruption. Of those who were stricken none
recovered, and the illness was ever the same--gross boils, raving, and
the black blotches which gave its name to the disease. All through the
winter the dead rotted by the wayside for want of some one to bury them.
In many a village no single man was left alive. Then at last the spring
came with sunshine and health and lightness and laughter--the greenest,
sweetest, tenderest spring that England had ever known--but only half
of England could know it. The other half had passed away with the great
purple cloud.
