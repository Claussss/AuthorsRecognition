      â€œColonel Barclay himself seems to have had some singular traits
      in his character. He was a dashing, jovial old soldier in his
      usual mood, but there were occasions on which he seemed to show
      himself capable of considerable violence and vindictiveness. This
      side of his nature, however, appears never to have been turned
      towards his wife. Another fact, which had struck Major Murphy and
      three out of five of the other officers with whom I conversed,
      was the singular sort of depression which came upon him at times.
      As the major expressed it, the smile had often been struck from
      his mouth, as if by some invisible hand, when he has been joining
      the gayeties and chaff of the mess-table. For days on end, when
      the mood was on him, he has been sunk in the deepest gloom. This
      and a certain tinge of superstition were the only unusual traits
      in his character which his brother officers had observed. The
      latter peculiarity took the form of a dislike to being left
      alone, especially after dark. This puerile feature in a nature
      which was conspicuously manly had often given rise to comment and
      conjecture.
