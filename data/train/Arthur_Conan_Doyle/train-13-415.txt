      “I fancy it’s some local practitioner,” said the Colonel. “In
      that case, of course, Acton’s and Cunningham’s are just the
      places he would go for, since they are far the largest about
      here.”       “And richest?”       “Well, they ought to be, but they’ve had a lawsuit for some years
      which has sucked the blood out of both of them, I fancy. Old
      Acton has some claim on half Cunningham’s estate, and the lawyers
      have been at it with both hands.”
