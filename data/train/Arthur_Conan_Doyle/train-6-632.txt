“It is none too soon,” said the old shipman, pointing to a yellowish
tint in the haze above them. “See yonder! It is the sun which wins
through. It will be here anon. Ah! said I not so?” A sickly sun, no larger and far dimmer than the moon, had indeed shown
its face, with cloud-wreaths smoking across it. As they looked up it
waxed larger and brighter before their eyes--a yellow halo spread round
it, one ray broke through, and then a funnel of golden light poured
down upon them, widening swiftly at the base. A minute later they were
sailing on a clear blue sea with an azure cloud-flecked sky above their
heads, and such a scene beneath it as each of them would carry in his
memory while memory remained.
