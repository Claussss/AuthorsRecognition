“To the wood, the flax, and the gander's wing!” said an old gray-headed
archer on the right. “To a gentle loose, and the King of Spain for a mark at fourteen score!”
 cried another. “To a bloody war!” shouted a fourth. “Many to go and few to come!” “With the most gold to the best steel!” added a fifth. “And a last cup to the maids of our heart!” cried Aylward. “A steady
hand and a true eye, boys; so let two quarts be a bowman's portion.”
 With shout and jest and snatch of song they streamed from the room, and
all was peaceful once more in the “Rose de Guienne.”
