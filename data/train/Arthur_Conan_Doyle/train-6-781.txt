But a thought had flashed through Nigel's mind. “See, fair sir,” said
he. “The nails of yonder door are red-hot and the wood as white as
ashes. Surely we can break our way through it.” “By the Virgin, you speak truly!” cried the French Squire. “If we can
cross the ditch the gate will not stop us. Come, Nigel, for our fair
ladies' sakes, I will race you who will reach it first, England or
France.” Alas for all the wise words of the good Chandos! Alas for all the
lessons in order and discipline learned from the wary Knolles. In an
instant, forgetful of all things but this noble challenge, Nigel was
running at the top of his speed for the burning gate. Close at his heels
was the Frenchman, blowing and gasping, as he rushed along in his brazen
armor. Behind came a stream of howling archers and men-at-arms, like a
flood which has broken its dam. Down they slipped into the ditch, rushed
across it, and clambered on each other's backs up the opposite side.
Nigel, Raoul and two archers gained a foothold in front of the burning
gate at the same moment. With blows and kicks they burst it to pieces,
and dashed with a yell of triumph through the dark archway beyond. For a
moment they thought with mad rapture that the castle was carried. A dark
tunnel lay before them, down which they rushed. But alas! at the farther
end it was blocked by a second gateway as strong as that which had been
burned. In vain they beat upon it with their swords and axes. On
each side the tunnel was pierced with slits, and the crossbow bolts
discharged at only a few yards' distance crashed through armor as if it
were cloth and laid man after man upon the stones. They raged and leaped
before the great iron-clamped barrier, but the wall itself was as easy
to tear down.
