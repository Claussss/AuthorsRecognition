All else in the man--his noble proportions, his fine features, and his
frank bearing--fitted in with that jovial, man-to-man manner which he
affected. Here, one would say, is a bluff, honest fellow, whose heart
would be sound however rude his outspoken words might seem. It was only
when those dead, dark eyes, deep and remorseless, were turned upon a man
that he shrank within himself, feeling that he was face to face with
an infinite possibility of latent evil, with a strength and courage and
cunning behind it which made it a thousand times more deadly.
