“But surely, my fair lord,” said Alleyne, “you have done some great
feats of arms since we left the Lady Loring.” “I cannot call any to mind,” answered Sir Nigel. “There was the taking of the sea-rovers, and the holding of the keep
against the Jacks.” “Nay, nay,” said the knight, “these were not feats of arms, but mere
wayside ventures and the chances of travel. By Saint Paul! if it were
not that these hills are over-steep for Pommers, I would ride to these
cavaliers of Navarre and see if there were not some among them who would
help me to take this patch from mine eye. It is a sad sight to see this
very fine pass, which my own Company here could hold against an army,
and yet to ride through it with as little profit as though it were the
lane from my kennels to the Avon.”
