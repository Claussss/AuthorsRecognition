Nigel tethered Pommers to a thorn-bush and then turned his attention
to the injured man. The white horse had regained his feet and stood
whinnying gently as he looked down on his prostrate master. A heavy
blow, half broken by his sword, had beaten him down and left a great raw
bruise upon his forehead. But a stream gurgled through the gorge, and
a capful of water dashed over his face brought the senses back to the
injured man. He was a mere stripling, with the delicate features of a
woman, and a pair of great violet-blue eyes which looked up presently
with a puzzled stare into Nigel's face.
