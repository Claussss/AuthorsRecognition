all thoughts are things, you have but to think a pair of herrings, and
then conjure up a pottle of milk wherewith to wash them down.” “A brave piece of reasoning,” cried the other, “and I know of but one
reply to it.” On which, leaning forward, he caught his comrade a rousing
smack across his rosy cheek. “Nay, take it not amiss,” he said, “since
all things are but thoughts, then that also is but a thought and may be
disregarded.”
