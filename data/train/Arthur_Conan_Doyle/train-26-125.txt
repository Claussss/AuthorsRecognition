There is a quality of heart about his work which I recognize nowhere
else. He so absolutely loves his own heroes and heroines, while he
so cordially detests his own villains, that he sweeps your emotions
along with his own. No one has ever spoken warmly enough of the
humanity and the lovability of his women. It is a rare gift--very
rare for a man--this power of drawing a human and delightful girl.
If there is a better one in nineteenth-century fiction than Julia
Dodd I have never had the pleasure of meeting her. A man who could
draw a character so delicate and so delightful, and yet could write
such an episode as that of the Robber Inn in "The Cloister and the
Hearth," adventurous romance in its highest form, has such a range
of power as is granted to few men. My hat is always ready to come
off to Charles Reade.
