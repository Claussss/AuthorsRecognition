It was the sound of Agatha's voice and the rustle of her dress which
restored me.  I looked up, and saw her blue eyes, so full of tenderness
and pity, gazing down at me. "We must take you away to the country, Austin," she said.  "You want
rest and quiet.  You look wretchedly ill." "Oh, it is nothing!" said I, trying to smile.  "It was only a momentary
weakness.  I am all right again now." "I am so sorry to keep you waiting.  Poor boy, you must have been here
quite half an hour!  The vicar was in the drawing-room, and, as I knew
that you did not care for him, I thought it better that Jane should
show you up here.  I thought the man would never go!"
