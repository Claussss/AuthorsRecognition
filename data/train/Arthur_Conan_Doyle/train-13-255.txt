      There was a pause after the stockbroker’s clerk had concluded his
      surprising experience. Then Sherlock Holmes cocked his eye at me,
      leaning back on the cushions with a pleased and yet critical
      face, like a connoisseur who has just taken his first sip of a
      comet vintage.       “Rather fine, Watson, is it not?” said he. “There are points in
      it which please me. I think that you will agree with me that an
      interview with Mr. Arthur Harry Pinner in the temporary offices
      of the Franco-Midland Hardware Company, Limited, would be a
      rather interesting experience for both of us.”
