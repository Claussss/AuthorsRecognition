It was clear tae me that the general and his hoose were baith under some
curse, and it was fit that that curse should fa' on them that had earned
it, and no' on a righteous Presbyterian, wha had ever trod the narrow
path. My hairt was sair for young Miss Gabriel--for she was a bonnie and
winsome lassie--but for a' that, I felt that my duty was tae mysel' and
that I should gang forth, even as Lot ganged oot o' the wicked cities o'
the plain.
