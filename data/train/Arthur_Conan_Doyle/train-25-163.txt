upon July 15th, at 12 o'clock precisely." 
Lord John had placed his watch upon the table beside him. "We have seven more minutes," said he.  "The old dear is very precise." Professor Summerlee gave an acid smile as he picked up the envelope in
his gaunt hand. "What can it possibly matter whether we open it now or in seven
minutes?" said he.  "It is all part and parcel of the same system of
quackery and nonsense, for which I regret to say that the writer is
notorious."
