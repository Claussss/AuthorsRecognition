      “The paper! Of course!” yelled Holmes, in a paroxysm of
      excitement. “Idiot that I was! I thought so much of our visit
      that the paper never entered my head for an instant. To be sure,
      the secret must be there.” He flattened it out upon the table,
      and a cry of triumph burst from his lips. “Look at this, Watson,”
      he cried. “It is a London paper, an early edition of the _Evening
      Standard_. Here is what we want. Look at the headlines: ‘Crime in
      the City. Murder at Mawson & Williams’. Gigantic Attempted
      Robbery. Capture of the Criminal.’ Here, Watson, we are all
      equally anxious to hear it, so kindly read it aloud to us.”
