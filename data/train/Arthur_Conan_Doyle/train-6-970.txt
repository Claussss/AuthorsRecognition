XXVI. HOW NIGEL FOUND HIS THIRD DEED 
Four archers lay behind a clump of bushes ten yards in front of the
thick hedge which shielded their companions. Amid the long line of
bowmen those behind them were their own company, and in the main the
same who were with Knolles in Brittany. The four in front were their
leaders: old Wat of Carlisle, Ned Widdington the red-headed Dalesman,
the bald bowyer Bartholomew, and Samkin Alyward, newly rejoined after a
week's absence. All four were munching bread and apples, for Aylward had
brought in a full haversack and divided them freely amongst his
starving comrades. The old Borderer and the Yorkshireman were gaunt and
hollow-eyed with privation, while the bowyer's round face had fallen in
so that the skin hung in loose pouches under his eyes and beneath his
jaws.
