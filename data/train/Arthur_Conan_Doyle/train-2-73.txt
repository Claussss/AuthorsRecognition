In the cab was a woman, half-collapsed from nervous exhaustion. She
bore upon her aquiline and emaciated face the traces of some recent
tragedy. Her head hung listlessly upon her breast, but as she raised it
and turned her dull eyes upon us I saw that her pupils were dark dots
in the centre of the broad grey iris. She was drugged with opium. “I watched at the gate, same as you advised, Mr. Holmes,” said our
emissary, the discharged gardener. “When the carriage came out I
followed it to the station. She was like one walking in her sleep, but
when they tried to get her into the train she came to life and
struggled. They pushed her into the carriage. She fought her way out
again. I took her part, got her into a cab, and here we are. I shan’t
forget the face at the carriage window as I led her away. I’d have a
short life if he had his way—the black-eyed, scowling, yellow devil.”
