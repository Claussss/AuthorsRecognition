      “‘Show him round here.’ An instant afterwards there appeared a
      little wizened fellow with a cringing manner and a shambling
      style of walking. He wore an open jacket, with a splotch of tar
      on the sleeve, a red-and-black check shirt, dungaree trousers,
      and heavy boots badly worn. His face was thin and brown and
      crafty, with a perpetual smile upon it, which showed an irregular
      line of yellow teeth, and his crinkled hands were half closed in
      a way that is distinctive of sailors. As he came slouching across
      the lawn I heard Mr. Trevor make a sort of hiccoughing noise in
      his throat, and jumping out of his chair, he ran into the house.
      He was back in a moment, and I smelt a strong reek of brandy as
      he passed me.
