him as he leaned back in a basket-chair. “Frankly, then, madam, I do not.” “You think that he is dead?” “Murdered?” “I don’t say that. Perhaps.” “And on what day did he meet his death?” “On Monday.” “Then perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is
that I have received a letter from him to-day.”
