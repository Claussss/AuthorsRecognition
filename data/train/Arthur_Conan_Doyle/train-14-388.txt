      “Why should we not seize him at once?”       “Our case is not complete. The fellow is wary and cunning to the
      last degree. It is not what we know, but what we can prove. If we
      make one false move the villain may escape us yet.”       “What can we do?”       “There will be plenty for us to do tomorrow. Tonight we can only
      perform the last offices to our poor friend.”       Together we made our way down the precipitous slope and
      approached the body, black and clear against the silvered stones.
      The agony of those contorted limbs struck me with a spasm of pain
      and blurred my eyes with tears.
