“People have been burned for less, have they not?” cried Raffles Haw
laughing heartily. “Have you had enough of the Amazon? What do you say
to a spell of Egypt?” Again the whirr, the swift flash of passing objects, and in an instant
a huge desert stretched on every side of them, as far as the eye could
reach. In the foreground a clump of five palm-trees towered into the
air, with a profusion of rough cactus-like plants bristling from their
base. On the other side rose a rugged, gnarled, grey monolith, carved at
the base into a huge scarabaeus. A group of lizards played about on the
surface of the old carved stone. Beyond, the yellow sand stretched away
into furthest space, where the dim mirage mist played along the horizon.
