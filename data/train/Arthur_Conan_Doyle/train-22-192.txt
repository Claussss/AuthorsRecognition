MacDonald pointed ruefully to his heap of correspondence. “He is at present reported from Leicester, Nottingham, Southampton,
Derby, East Ham, Richmond, and fourteen other places. In three of
them--East Ham, Leicester, and Liverpool--there is a clear case against
him, and he has actually been arrested. The country seems to be full of
the fugitives with yellow coats.” “Dear me!” said Holmes sympathetically. “Now, Mr. Mac and you, Mr. White
Mason, I wish to give you a very earnest piece of advice. When I went
into this case with you I bargained, as you will no doubt remember, that
I should not present you with half-proved theories, but that I should
retain and work out my own ideas until I had satisfied myself that they
were correct. For this reason I am not at the present moment telling you
all that is in my mind. On the other hand, I said that I would play the
game fairly by you, and I do not think it is a fair game to allow you
for one unnecessary moment to waste your energies upon a profitless
task. Therefore I am here to advise you this morning, and my advice to
you is summed up in three words--abandon the case.”
