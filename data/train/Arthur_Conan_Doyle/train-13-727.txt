      “Oh, yes, I should like a little sunshine. Joseph will come,
      too.”       “And I also,” said Miss Harrison.       “I am afraid not,” said Holmes, shaking his head. “I think I must
      ask you to remain sitting exactly where you are.”       The young lady resumed her seat with an air of displeasure. Her
      brother, however, had joined us and we set off all four together.
      We passed round the lawn to the outside of the young
      diplomatist’s window. There were, as he had said, marks upon the
      bed, but they were hopelessly blurred and vague. Holmes stopped
      over them for an instant, and then rose shrugging his shoulders.
