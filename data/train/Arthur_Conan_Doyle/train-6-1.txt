     XXV. HOW THE KING OF FRANCE HELD COUNSEL AT MAUPERTUIS      XXVI. HOW NIGEL FOUND HIS THIRD DEED      XXVII. HOW THE THIRD MESSENGER CAME TO COSFORD 
INTRODUCTION 
Dame History is so austere a lady that if one, has been so ill-advised
as to take a liberty with her, one should hasten to make amends by
repentance and confession. Events have been transposed to the extent of
some few months in this narrative in order to preserve the continuity
and evenness of the story. I hope so small a divergence may seem a
venial error after so many centuries. For the rest, it is as accurate as
a good deal of research and hard work could make it.
