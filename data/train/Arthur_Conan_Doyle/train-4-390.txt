‘He is dead,’ said our leader, pouring a fresh charge into his pistol.
‘It is the law of war, Clarke,’ he added, looking round at me. ‘He hath
chosen to break it, and must pay forfeit.’ As he spoke I saw the young officer lean gradually over in his saddle,
until, when about half-way back to his friends, he lost his balance and
fell heavily in the roadway, turning over two or three times with
the force of his fall, and lying at last still and motionless, a
dust-coloured heap. A loud yell of rage broke from the troopers at
the sight, which was answered by a shout of defiance from the Puritan
peasantry.
