      A heavy step was heard upon the stairs, and an instant later
      there entered a tall, ruddy, clean-shaven gentleman, whose clear
      eyes and florid cheeks told of a life led far from the fogs of
      Baker Street. He seemed to bring a whiff of his strong, fresh,
      bracing, east-coast air with him as he entered. Having shaken
      hands with each of us, he was about to sit down, when his eye
      rested upon the paper with the curious markings, which I had just
      examined and left upon the table.
