“It was not so that war was made when good King Edward first turned his
hand to it,” said Sir Nigel sadly. “Ah! Alleyne, I fear that you will
never live to see such things, for the minds of men are more set upon
money and gain than of old. By Saint Paul! it was a noble sight when two
great armies would draw together upon a certain day, and all who had
a vow would ride forth to discharge themselves of it. What noble
spear-runnings have I not seen, and even in an humble way had a part in,
when cavaliers would run a course for the easing of their souls and for
the love of their ladies! Never a bad word have I for the French, for,
though I have ridden twenty times up to their array, I have never yet
failed to find some very gentle and worthy knight or squire who was
willing to do what he might to enable me to attempt some small feat of
arms. Then, when all cavaliers had been satisfied, the two armies would
come to hand-strokes, and fight right merrily until one or other had the
vantage. By Saint Paul! it was not our wont in those days to pay gold
for the opening of passes, nor would we hold a king as hostage lest
his people come to thrusts with us. In good sooth, if the war is to be
carried out in such a fashion, then it is grief to me that I ever came
away from Castle Twynham, for I would not have left my sweet lady had I
not thought that there were deeds of arms to be done.”
