      â€œThere were three sisters altogether. The old one was just a good
      woman, the second was a devil, and the third was an angel. Sarah
      was thirty-three, and Mary was twenty-nine when I married. We
      were just as happy as the day was long when we set up house
      together, and in all Liverpool there was no better woman than my
      Mary. And then we asked Sarah up for a week, and the week grew
      into a month, and one thing led to another, until she was just
      one of ourselves.
