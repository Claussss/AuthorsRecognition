friend of Lady Frances Carfax who is inquiring after her just now. Only
a week or so ago we had a man here upon the same errand.” “Did he give a name?” I asked. “None; but he was an Englishman, though of an unusual type.” “A savage?” said I, linking my facts after the fashion of my
illustrious friend. “Exactly. That describes him very well. He is a bulky, bearded,
sunburned fellow, who looks as if he would be more at home in a
farmers’ inn than in a fashionable hotel. A hard, fierce man, I should
think, and one whom I should be sorry to offend.”
