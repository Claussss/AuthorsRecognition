“Well,” said Colonel Cochrane, crossing his legs and leaning forward
with the decision of a man who has definite opinions, “I don't at all
agree with you, Brown, and I think that to advocate such a course is
to take a very limited view of our national duties. I think that behind
national interests and diplomacy and all that there lies a great guiding
force,--a Providence, in fact,--which is for ever getting the best out
of each nation and using it for the good of the whole. When a nation
ceases to respond, it is time that she went into hospital for a few
centuries, like Spain or Greece,--the virtue has gone out of her. A man
or a nation is not here upon this earth merely to do what is pleasant
and profitable. It is often called upon to carry out what is unpleasant
and unprofitable; but if it is obviously right, it is mere shirking not
to undertake it.”
