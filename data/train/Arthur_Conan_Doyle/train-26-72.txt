And on the whole this is justified by the facts. Some men are
greater than their work. Their work only represents one facet of
their character, and there may be a dozen others, all remarkable,
and uniting to make one complex and unique creature. It was not so
with Gibbon. He was a cold-blooded man, with a brain which seemed to
have grown at the expense of his heart. I cannot recall in his life
one generous impulse, one ardent enthusiasm, save for the Classics.
His excellent judgment was never clouded by the haze of human
emotion--or, at least, it was such an emotion as was well under
the control of his will. Could anything be more laudable--or less
lovable? He abandons his girl at the order of his father, and sums
it up that he "sighs as a lover but obeys as a son." The father
dies, and he records the fact with the remark that "the tears of
a son are seldom lasting." The terrible spectacle of the French
Revolution excited in his mind only a feeling of self-pity because
his retreat in Switzerland was invaded by the unhappy refugees, just
as a grumpy country gentleman in England might complain that he
was annoyed by the trippers. There is a touch of dislike in all
the allusions which Boswell makes to Gibbon--often without even
mentioning his name--and one cannot read the great historian's life
without understanding why.
