should he pay you?” “It is but a small matter,” Simon answered; “but I am a poor man and the
payment would be welcome. Should it have chanced that we stopped at this
island I should have craved your leave that I go ashore and ask for that
which I have fairly won.” Sir Robert Knolles laughed. “This business tickleth my fancy,” said he.
“As to stopping at the island, this shipman tells me that we must needs
wait a day and a night, for that we have strained our planks. But if you
should go ashore, how will you be sure that you will be free to depart,
or that you will see this King of whom you speak?”
