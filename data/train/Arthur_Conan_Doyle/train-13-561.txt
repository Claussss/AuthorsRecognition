      “Is there not one alternative,” I suggested, “grotesquely
      improbable, no doubt, but still just conceivable? Might the whole
      story of the cataleptic Russian and his son be a concoction of
      Dr. Trevelyan’s, who has, for his own purposes, been in
      Blessington’s rooms?”       I saw in the gaslight that Holmes wore an amused smile at this
      brilliant departure of mine.       “My dear fellow,” said he, “it was one of the first solutions
      which occurred to me, but I was soon able to corroborate the
      doctor’s tale. This young man has left prints upon the
      stair-carpet which made it quite superfluous for me to ask to see
      those which he had made in the room. When I tell you that his
      shoes were square-toed instead of being pointed like
      Blessington’s, and were quite an inch and a third longer than the
      doctor’s, you will acknowledge that there can be no doubt as to
      his individuality. But we may sleep on it now, for I shall be
      surprised if we do not hear something further from Brook Street
      in the morning.”
