      It was evening before we reached the little town of Tavistock,
      which lies, like the boss of a shield, in the middle of the huge
      circle of Dartmoor. Two gentlemen were awaiting us in the
      stationâ€”the one a tall, fair man with lion-like hair and beard
      and curiously penetrating light blue eyes; the other a small,
      alert person, very neat and dapper, in a frock-coat and gaiters,
      with trim little side-whiskers and an eye-glass. The latter was
      Colonel Ross, the well-known sportsman; the other, Inspector
      Gregory, a man who was rapidly making his name in the English
      detective service.
