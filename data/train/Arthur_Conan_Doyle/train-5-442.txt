fright I got!  I was reading here, and he had gone for a stroll as far
as the river, when I heard a scream and a splash.  Out I ran, and by
the time that I could find him and fish him out, all life seemed to
have gone.  Then Simpson couldn't get a doctor, for he has a game-leg,
and I had to run, and I don't know what I'd have done without you
fellows.  That's right, old chap.  Sit up."
