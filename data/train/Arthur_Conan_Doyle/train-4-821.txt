‘At least he did not refuse you,’ said I. ‘It is as good as a promise
that; should the cause be successful, you shall be so too.’ ‘By my faith,’ cried Reuben, ‘if a man could by his own single blade

raised his eyes to his master’s daughter, and the old man was ready to
have him as a son, so much was he taken by his godliness and zeal. Yet I

man, though he covers his pleasures with a mask of piety. I thought as
you did think that he was at the head of the roisterers who tried to
bear Mistress Ruth away, though, i’ faith, I can scarce think harshly
of them, since they did me the greatest service that ever men did yet.
Meanwhile I have taken occasion, ere we left Wells two nights ago, to
speak to Master Derrick on the matter, and to warn him as he loved his
life to plan no treachery against her.
