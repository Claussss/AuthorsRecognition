With tender hands the Squire lowered his comrade's head, but even as he
did so there came a choking rush of blood, and the soul had passed. So
died a gallant cavalier of France, and Nigel as he knelt in the ditch
beside him prayed that his own end might be as noble and as debonair. 
XXI. HOW THE SECOND MESSENGER WENT TO COSFORD Under cover of night the wounded men were lifted from the ditch and
carried back, whilst pickets of archers were advanced to the very
gate so that none should rebuild it. Nigel, sick at heart over his own
failure, the death of his prisoner and his fears for Aylward, crept back
into the camp, but his cup was not yet full, for Knolles was waiting for
him with a tongue which cut like a whip-lash. Who was he, a raw squire,
that he should lead an attack without orders? See what his crazy knight
errantry had brought about. Twenty men had been destroyed by it and
nothing gained. Their blood was on his head. Chandos should hear of his
conduct. He should be sent back to England when the castle had fallen.
