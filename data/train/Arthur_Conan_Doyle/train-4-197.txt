‘We may meet on the field of battle, if not before,’ said I, and we bade
our friendly enemies a very cordial adieu. ‘A skilful equivoque that last of yours, Master Micah,’ quoth Decimus
Saxon, ‘though smacking of double dealing in a truth-lover like
yourself. If we meet them in battle I trust that it may be with
chevaux-de-frise of pikes and morgenstierns before us, and a litter of
caltrops in front of them, for Monmouth has no cavalry that could stand
for a moment against the Royal Guards.’
