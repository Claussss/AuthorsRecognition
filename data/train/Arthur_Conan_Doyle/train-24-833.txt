Whilst the Seneschal of Villefranche had been detailing the evil doings
of his tenants, Alleyne had been unable to take his eyes from the face
of Lady Tiphaine. She had lain back in her chair, with drooping eyelids
and bloodless face, so that he had feared at first her journey had
weighed heavily upon her, and that the strength was ebbing out of her.
Of a sudden, however, there came a change, for a dash of bright color
flickered up on to either cheek, and her lids were slowly raised again
upon eyes which sparkled with such lustre as Alleyne had never seen
in human eyes before, while their gaze was fixed intently, not on the
company, but on the dark tapestry which draped the wall. So transformed
and so ethereal was her expression, that Alleyne, in his loftiest dream
of archangel or of seraph, had never pictured so sweet, so womanly, and
yet so wise a face. Glancing at Du Guesclin, Alleyne saw that he also
was watching his wife closely, and from the twitching of his features,
and the beads upon his brick-colored brow, it was easy to see that he
was deeply agitated by the change which he marked in her.
