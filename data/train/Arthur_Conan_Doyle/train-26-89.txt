  "O England! long, long may it be ere the sun of thy glory sink
  beneath the wave of darkness! Though gloomy and portentous
  clouds are now gathering rapidly around thee, still, still
  may it please the Almighty to disperse them, and to grant thee
  a futurity longer in duration and still brighter in renown
  than thy past! Or, if thy doom be at hand, may that doom be
  a noble one, and worthy of her who has been styled the Old
  Queen of the waters! May thou sink, if thou dost sink, amidst
  blood and flame, with a mighty noise, causing more than one
  nation to participate in thy downfall! Of all fates, may it
  please the Lord to preserve thee from a disgraceful and a
  slow decay; becoming, ere extinct, a scorn and a mockery for
  those self-same foes who now, though they envy and abhor thee,
  still fear thee, nay even against their will, honour and
  respect thee.... Remove from thee the false prophets, who
  have seen vanity and divined lies; who have daubed thy wall
  with untempered mortar, that it may fall; who see visions
  of peace where there is no peace; who have strengthened the
  hands of the wicked, and made the heart of the righteous sad.
  Oh, do this, and fear not the result, for either shall
  thy end be a majestic and an enviable one; or God shall
  perpetuate thy reign upon the waters, thou Old Queen!"
