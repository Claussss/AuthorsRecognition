The reader has now the evidence before him, and can form his own
opinions unaided by me as to the causes of the disappearance and death
of Rufus Smith and of John Berthier Heatherstone, V.C., C.B. There is only one point which is still dark to me. Why the _chelas_ of
Ghoolab Shah should have removed their victims to the desolate Hole of
Cree instead of taking their lives at Cloomber, is, I confess, a mystery
to me.
