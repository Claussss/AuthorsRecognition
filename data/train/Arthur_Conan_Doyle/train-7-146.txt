His face flushed, his lips curled back, he chattered, his teeth like
an ape, and his eyes --those indolent eyes which had always twinkled so
placidly--were gorged and frantic. He threw himself upon the negro, and
struck him again and again, feebly but viciously, in his broad, black
face. He hit like a girl, round arm, with an open palm. The man winced
away for an instant, appalled by this sudden blaze of passion. Then with
an impatient, snarling cry he slid a knife from his long loose sleeve
and struck upwards under the whirling arm. Brown sat down at the blow
and began to cough--to cough as a man coughs who has choked at dinner,
furiously, ceaselessly, spasm after spasm. Then the angry red cheeks
turned to a mottled pallor, there were liquid sounds in his throat, and,
clapping his hand to his mouth, he rolled over on to his side.
