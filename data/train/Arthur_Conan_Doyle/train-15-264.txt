A POINT OF CONTACT 
A curious train of thought is started when one reflects upon those great
figures who have trod the stage of this earth, and actually played their
parts in the same act, without ever coming face to face, or even knowing
of each other's existence. Baber, the Great Mogul, was, for example,
overrunning India at the very moment when Hernando Cortez was
overrunning Mexico, and yet the two could never have heard of each
other. Or, to take a more supreme example, what could the Emperor
Augustus CÃ¦sar know of a certain Carpenter's shop wherein there worked a
dreamy-eyed boy who was destined to change the whole face of the world?
It may be, however, that sometimes these great contemporary forces did
approach, touch, and separate--each unaware of the true meaning of the
other. So it was in the instance which is now narrated.
