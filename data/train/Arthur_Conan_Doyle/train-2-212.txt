“If, then, Mortimer Tregennis disappeared from the scene, and yet some
outside person affected the card-players, how can we reconstruct that
person, and how was such an impression of horror conveyed? Mrs. Porter
may be eliminated. She is evidently harmless. Is there any evidence
that someone crept up to the garden window and in some manner produced
so terrific an effect that he drove those who saw it out of their
senses? The only suggestion in this direction comes from Mortimer
Tregennis himself, who says that his brother spoke about some movement
in the garden. That is certainly remarkable, as the night was rainy,
cloudy, and dark. Anyone who had the design to alarm these people would
be compelled to place his very face against the glass before he could
be seen. There is a three-foot flower-border outside this window, but
no indication of a footmark. It is difficult to imagine, then, how an
outsider could have made so terrible an impression upon the company,
nor have we found any possible motive for so strange and elaborate an
attempt. You perceive our difficulties, Watson?”
