‘They have vowed that none other should lead them,’ said the minister,
standing by Saxon’s stirrup. ‘I could not wish to lead stouter fellows,’ said he. ‘Let them deploy
into double line in front of the town-hall. So, so, smartly there, rear
rank!’ he shouted, facing his horse towards them. ‘Now swing round into
position. Keep your ground, left flank, and let the others pivot upon
you. So--as hard and as straight as an Andrea Ferrara. I prythee,
friend, do not carry your pike as though it were a hoe, though I trust
you will do some weeding in the Lord’s vineyard with it. And you, sir,
your musquetoon should be sloped upon your shoulder, and not borne under
your arm like a dandy’s cane. Did ever an unhappy soldier find himself
called upon to make order among so motley a crew! Even my good friend
the Fleming cannot so avail here, nor does Petrinus, in his “De re
militari,” lay down any injunctions as to the method of drilling a man
who is armed with a sickle or a scythe.’
