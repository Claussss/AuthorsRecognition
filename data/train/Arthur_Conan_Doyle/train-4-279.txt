‘I am truly beholden to you, sir,’ said Reuben; ‘I can scarce find words
to express my thanks. Holy mother! I have a mind to ride straight back
to Havant, to show them how stout a man-at-arms hath been reared amongst
them.’ ‘It is steel of proof,’ Sir Jacob remarked; ‘a pistol-bullet might
glance from it. And you,’ he continued, turning to me, ‘here is a small
gift by which you shall remember this meeting. I did observe that you
did cast a wistful eye upon my bookshelf. It is Plutarch’s lives of the
ancient worthies, done into English by the ingenious Mr. Latimer. Carry
this volume with you, and shape your life after the example of the giant
men whose deeds are here set forth. In your saddle-bag I place a small
but weighty packet, which I desire you to hand over to Monmouth upon
the day of your arrival in his camp. As to you, sir,’ addressing Decimus
Saxon, ‘here is a slug of virgin gold for you, which may fashion into a
pin or such like ornament. You may wear it with a quiet conscience, for
it is fairly given to you and not filched from your entertainer whilst
he slept.’
