Now, take that first book on my travel shelf. It is Knight's "Cruise
of the Falcon." Nature was guilty of the pun which put this soul
into a body so named. Read this simple record and tell me if there
is anything in Hakluyt more wonderful. Two landsmen--solicitors,
if I remember right--go down to Southampton Quay. They pick up a
long-shore youth, and they embark in a tiny boat in which they put
to sea. Where do they turn up? At Buenos Ayres. Thence they
penetrate to Paraquay, return to the West Indies, sell their little
boat there, and so home. What could the Elizabethan mariners have
done more? There are no Spanish galleons now to vary the monotony of
such a voyage, but had there been I am very certain our adventurers
would have had their share of the doubloons. But surely it was the
nobler when done out of the pure lust of adventure and in answer to
the call of the sea, with no golden bait to draw them on. The old
spirit still lives, disguise it as you will with top hats, frock
coats, and all prosaic settings. Perhaps even they also will seem
romantic when centuries have blurred them.
