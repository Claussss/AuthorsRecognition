      A sad-faced, elderly woman came into the room.       “Did you dust this bureau yesterday morning?”       “Yes, sir.”       “Did you notice this scratch?”       “No, sir, I did not.”       “I am sure you did not, for a duster would have swept away these
      shreds of varnish. Who has the key of this bureau?”       “The Professor keeps it on his watch-chain.”       “Is it a simple key?”       “No, sir, it is a Chubb’s key.”
