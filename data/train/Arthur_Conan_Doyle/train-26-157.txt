The loss of the Prussians at Waterloo was not far short of our own.
You would not know it, to read our historians. And then the abuse
of our Belgian allies has been overdone. Some of them fought
splendidly, and one brigade of infantry had a share in the critical
instant when the battle was turned. This also you would not learn
from British sources. Look at our Portuguese allies also! They
trained into magnificent troops, and one of Wellington's earnest
desires was to have ten thousand of them for his Waterloo campaign.
It was a Portuguese who first topped the rampart of Badajos. They
have never had their due credit, nor have the Spaniards either, for,
though often defeated, it was their unconquerable pertinacity which
played a great part in the struggle. No; I do not think that we are
very amiable partners, but I suppose that all national history may
be open to a similar charge.
