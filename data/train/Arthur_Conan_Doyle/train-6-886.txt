Then with a loud cry of “Allez!” the herald dropped his upraised hand,
and the two lines of men shuffled as fast as their heavy armor would
permit until they met with a sharp clang of metal in the middle of the
field. There was a sound as of sixty smiths working upon their anvils.
Then the babel of yells and shouts from the spectators, cheering on this
party or that, rose and swelled until even the uproar of the combat was
drowned in that mighty surge.
