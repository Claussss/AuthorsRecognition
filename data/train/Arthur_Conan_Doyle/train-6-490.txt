“It is no Winchelsea boat,” said the Mayor. “She is longer and broader
in the beam than ours.” “Horses! bring horses!” cried Chandos. “Come, Nigel, let us go further
into the matter.” A busy crowd of varlets, archers, and men-at-arms swarmed round the
gateway of the “Sign of the Broom Pod,” singing, shouting, and jostling
in rough good-fellowship. The sight of the tall thin figure of Chandos
brought order amongst them, and a few minutes later the horses were
ready and saddled. A breakneck ride down a steep declivity, and then
a gallop of two miles over the sedgy plain carried them to the outer
harbor. A dozen vessels were lying there, ready to start for Bordeaux or
Rochelle, and the quay was thick with sailors, laborers and townsmen and
heaped with wine-barrels and wool-packs.
