Weel, weeks passed into months and a' things grew waur instead o'
better in the Hall. The general he got mair nairvous, and his leddy
mair melancholy every day, and yet there wasna any quarrel or bickering
between them, for when they've been togither in the breakfast room
I used often tae gang round and prune the rose-tree alongside o'
the window, so that I couldna help hearin' a great pairt o' their
conversation, though sair against the grain.
