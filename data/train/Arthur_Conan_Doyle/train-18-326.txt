CHAPTER XIV. OF THE VISITOR WHO RAN DOWN THE ROAD IN THE NIGHT-TIME 
It was a quarter past ten o'clock by the parlour timepiece when my
father went off to his room, and left Esther and myself together. We
heard his slow steps dying away up the creaking staircase, until the
distant slamming of a door announced that he had reached his sanctum. The simple oil lamp upon the table threw a weird, uncertain light over
the old room, flickering upon the carved oak panelling, and casting
strange, fantastic shadows from the high-elbowed, straight-backed
furniture. My sister's white, anxious face stood out in the obscurity
with a startling exactness of profile like one of Rembrandt's portraits.
