to Brother Morris about on Miller Hill this morning?” The question came so suddenly that it was well that he had his answer
prepared. He burst into a hearty laugh. “Morris didn't know I could earn
a living here at home. He shan't know either; for he has got too much
conscience for the likes of me. But he's a good-hearted old chap. It was
his idea that I was at a loose end, and that he would do me a good turn
by offering me a clerkship in a drygoods store.”
