      “Who’s Teddy?” asked Holmes.       The man leaned over and pulled up the front of a kind of hutch in
      the corner. In an instant out there slipped a beautiful
      reddish-brown creature, thin and lithe, with the legs of a stoat,
      a long, thin nose, and a pair of the finest red eyes that ever I
      saw in an animal’s head.       “It’s a mongoose,” I cried.       “Well, some call them that, and some call them ichneumon,” said
      the man. “Snake-catcher is what I call them, and Teddy is amazing
      quick on cobras. I have one here without the fangs, and Teddy
      catches it every night to please the folk in the canteen.
