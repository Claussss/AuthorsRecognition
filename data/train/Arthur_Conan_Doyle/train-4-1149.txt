We were marched aboard and led below by the mate of the vessel, a tall
red-faced seaman with ear-rings in his ears, while the captain stood on
the poop with his legs apart and a pipe in his mouth, checking us off
one by one by means of a list which he held in his hand. As he looked
at the sturdy build and rustic health of the peasants, which even their
long confinement had been unable to break down, his eyes glistened, and
he rubbed his big red hands together with delight.
