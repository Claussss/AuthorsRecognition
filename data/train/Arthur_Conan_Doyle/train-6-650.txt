But now ship after ship of the English had come up, each throwing its
iron over the nearest Spaniard and striving to board her high red sides.
Twenty ships were drifting in furious single combat after the manner
of the Philippa, until the whole surface of the sea was covered with
a succession of these desperate duels. The dismasted carack, which
the King's ship had left behind it, had been carried by the Earl of
Suffolk's Christopher, and the water was dotted with the heads of her
crew. An English ship had been sunk by a huge stone discharged from
an engine, and her men also were struggling in the waves, none having
leisure to lend them a hand. A second English ship was caught between
two of the Spanish vessels and overwhelmed by a rush of boarders so that
not a man of her was left alive. On the other hand, Mowbray and Audley
had each taken the caracks which were opposed to them, and the battle in
the center, after swaying this way and that, was turning now in favor of
the Islanders.
