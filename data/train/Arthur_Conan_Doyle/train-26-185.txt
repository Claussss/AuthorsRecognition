It was a worthy sentence to carry such a message, written too in a
raging tempest, with sinking vessels all around him. But in the main
it is a poor crop from such a soil. No doubt our sailors were too
busy to do much writing, but none the less one wonders that among
so many thousands there were not some to understand what a treasure
their experiences would be to their descendants. I can call to mind
the old three-deckers which used to rot in Portsmouth Harbour, and
I have often thought, could they tell their tales, what a missing
chapter in our literature they could supply.
