“Unworthy enough!” quoth David Micheldene. “I would have you to know,
clerk, that I am a free English burgher, and that I dare say my mind to
our father the Pope himself, let alone such a lacquey's lacquey as you!” “Base-born and foul-mouthed knave!” cried the sompnour. “You prate of
holy things, to which your hog's mind can never rise. Keep silence, lest
I call a curse upon you!” “Silence yourself!” roared the other. “Foul bird! we found thee by the
gallows like a carrion-crow. A fine life thou hast of it with thy silks
and thy baubles, cozening the last few shillings from the pouches of
dying men. A fig for thy curse! Bide here, if you will take my rede, for
we will make England too hot for such as you, when Master Wicliff has
the ordering of it. Thou vile thief! it is you, and such as you, who
bring an evil name upon the many churchmen who lead a pure and a holy
life. Thou outside the door of heaven! Art more like to be inside the
door of hell.”
