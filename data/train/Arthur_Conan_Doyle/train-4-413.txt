‘Aye, aye!’ Saxon answered impatiently, ‘but the devil prevaileth at
times. Were not the chosen people themselves overthrown and led into
captivity? How say you, Clarke?’ ‘One such skirmish is enough for a day,’ I remarked. ‘Faith! if instead
of charging us they had continued that carbine fire, we must either have
come forth or been shot where we lay.’ ‘For that reason I forbade our friends with the muskets to answer it,’
said Saxon. ‘Our silence led them to think that we had but a pistol or
two among us, and so brought them to charge us. Thus our volley became
the more terrifying since it was unexpected. I’ll wager there was not a
man amongst them who did not feel that he had been led into a trap. Mark
you how the rogues wheeled and fled with one accord, as though it had
been part of their daily drill!’
