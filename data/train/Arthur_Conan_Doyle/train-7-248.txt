takes too much upon himself, this Colonel Cochrane.” “There! there!” said Belmont, soothingly, as if he were speaking to
a fractious child. “I am quite sure that the Colonel will express his
regret at what has happened, and will acknowledge that he was in the
wrong----” “I'll do nothing of the sort,” snapped the Colonel. “Besides, that is merely a personal quarrel,” Belmont continued,
hastily. “It is for the good of the whole party that we wish you to
speak with the Moolah, because we all feel that you are the best man for
the job.”
