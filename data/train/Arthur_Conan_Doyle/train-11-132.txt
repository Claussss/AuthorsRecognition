I laid aside my busby and drew my sword. “I have one favour to ask you, gentlemen,” said I. “Marshal Lannes has invited me to breakfast and I cannot keep him
waiting.” “What do you suggest?” asked Major Olivier. “That you release me from my promise to give you five minutes each, and
that you will permit me to attack you all together.” I stood upon my
guard as I spoke. But their answer was truly beautiful and truly French. With one impulse
the twelve swords flew from their scabbards and were raised in salute.
There they stood, the twelve of them, motionless, their heels together,
each with his sword upright before his face.
