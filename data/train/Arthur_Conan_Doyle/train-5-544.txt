"How did it happen?  Why, simply enough.  As the candles went over, the
chloroformist had stopped for an instant and had tried to catch them.
The patient, just as the light went out, had rolled off and under the
table.  Poor M'Namara, clinging frantically to him, had been dragged
across it, and the chloroformist, feeling him there, had naturally
claped the towel across his mouth and nose.  The others had secured
him, and the more he roared and kicked the more they drenched him with
chloroform.  Walker was very nice about it, and made the most handsome
apologies.  He offered to do a plastic on the spot, and make as good an
ear as he could, but M'Namara had had enough of it.  As to the patient,
we found him sleeping placidly under the table, with the ends of the
blanket screening him on both sides.  Walker sent M'Namara round his
ear next day in a jar of methylated spirit, but Mac's wife was very
angry about it, and it led to a good deal of ill-feeling.
