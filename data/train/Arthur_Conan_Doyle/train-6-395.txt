Mary stood irresolute and greatly troubled, holding down her pride
and her anger, but uncertain how best to deal with this strong wayward
spirit. “It is not a time for bitter words, dear sister,” said she, and again
she laid her hand upon her sister's sleeve. “All that you say may be
true. There was indeed a time when this man was friend to us both, and I
know even as you do the power which he may have to win a woman's heart.
But I know him now, and you do not. I know the evil that he has wrought,
the dishonor that he has brought, the perjury that lies upon his soul,
the confidence betrayed, the promise unfulfilled--all this I know. Am I
to see my own sister caught in the same well-used trap? Has it shut
upon you, child? Am I indeed already too late? For God's sake, tell me,
Edith, that it is not so?”
