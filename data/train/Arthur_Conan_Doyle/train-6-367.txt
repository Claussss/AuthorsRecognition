XII. HOW NIGEL FOUGHT THE TWISTED MAN OF SHALFORD 
In the days of which you read all classes, save perhaps the very poor,
fared better in meat and in drink than they have ever done since. The
country was covered with woodlands--there were seventy separate forests
in England alone, some of them covering half a shire. Within these
forests the great beasts of the chase were strictly preserved, but the
smaller game, the hares, the rabbits, the birds, which swarmed round the
coverts, found their way readily into the poor man's pot. Ale was very
cheap, and cheaper still was the mead which every peasant could make
for himself out of the wild honey in the tree-trunks. There were many
tea-like drinks also, which were brewed by the poor at no expense:
mallow tea, tansy tea, and others the secret of which has passed.
