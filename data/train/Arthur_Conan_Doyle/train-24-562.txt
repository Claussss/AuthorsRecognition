“My lord,” cried Don Martin, “I cannot stand there to hear such words
of my master. Did they come from other lips, I should know better how to
answer them.” Don Pedro frowned and curled his lip, but the prince smiled and nodded
his approbation. “Your bearing and your words, Don Martin, are such I should have looked
for in you,” he remarked. “You will tell the king, your master, that he
hath been paid his price and that if he holds to his promise he hath my
word for it that no scath shall come to his people, nor to their houses
or gear. If, however, we have not his leave, I shall come close at the
heels of this message without his leave, and bearing a key with me
which shall open all that he may close.” He stooped and whispered to Sir
Robert Knolles and Sir Huge Calverley, who smiled as men well pleased,
and hastened from the room.
