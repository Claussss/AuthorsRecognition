But now its pleasant and martial promenade changed suddenly to very
serious work of war. As the Prince moved south he found that all
supplies had been cleared away from in front of him and that there was
neither fodder for the horses nor food for the men. Two hundred wagons
laden with spoil rolled at the head of the army, but the starving
soldiers would soon have gladly changed it all for as many loads of
bread and of meat. The light troops of the French had preceded then and
burned or destroyed everything that could be of use. Now also for the
first time the Prince and his men became aware that a great army was
moving upon the eastern side of them, streaming southward in the hope of
cutting off their retreat to the sea. The sky glowed with their fires
at night, and the autumn sun twinkled and gleamed from one end of the
horizon to the other upon the steel caps and flashing weapons of a
mighty host.
