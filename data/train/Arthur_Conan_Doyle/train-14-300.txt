      “Have you got that slip?”       “No, sir, it crumbled all to bits after we moved it.”       “Had Sir Charles received any other letters in the same writing?”       “Well, sir, I took no particular notice of his letters. I should
      not have noticed this one, only it happened to come alone.”       “And you have no idea who L. L. is?”       “No, sir. No more than you have. But I expect if we could lay our
      hands upon that lady we should know more about Sir Charles’s
      death.”
