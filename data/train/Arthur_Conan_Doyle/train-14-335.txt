      “Then how is it that you did not go?”       “Because I received help in the interval from another source.”       “Why then, did you not write to Sir Charles and explain this?”       “So I should have done had I not seen his death in the paper next
      morning.”       The woman’s story hung coherently together, and all my questions
      were unable to shake it. I could only check it by finding if she
      had, indeed, instituted divorce proceedings against her husband
      at or about the time of the tragedy.
