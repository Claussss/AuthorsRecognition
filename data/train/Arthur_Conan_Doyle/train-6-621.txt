For five hours with a light breeze behind them they lurched through the
heavy fog, the cold rain still matting their beards and shining on their
faces. Sometimes they could see a circle of tossing water for a bowshot
or so in each direction, and then the wreaths would crawl in upon them
once more and bank them thickly round. They had long ceased to blow the
trumpet for their missing comrades, but had hopes when clear weather
came to find them still in sight. By the shipman's reckoning they were
now about midway between the two shores.
