“For myself,” said Sir Nigel, “I have heard such words fall from the
lips of this lady that I am of the opinion that there is no woman,
save only one, who can be in any way compared to her in beauty and in
goodness. Should any gentleman think otherwise, I should deem it great
honor to run a small course with him, or debate the matter in whatever
way might be most pleasing to him.” “Nay, it would ill become me to cast a slur upon a lady who is both
my guest and the wife of my comrade-in-arms,” said the Seneschal of
Villefranche. “I have perceived also that on her mantle there is marked
a silver cross, which is surely sign enough that there is nought of evil
in these strange powers which you say that she possesses.”
