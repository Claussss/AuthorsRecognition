These are a few of the properties of mediumship.  There are also the
beautiful phenomena of the production of lights, and the rarer, but for
evidential purposes even more valuable, manifestations of spirit
photography.  The fact that the photograph does not correspond in many
cases with any which existed in life, must surely silence the scoffer,
though there is a class of bigoted sceptic who would still be sneering
if an Archangel alighted in Trafalgar Square.  Mr. Hope and Mrs.
Buxton, of Crewe, have brought this phase of mediumship to great
perfection, though others have powers in that direction.  Indeed, in
some cases it is difficult to say who the medium may have been, for in
one collective family group which was taken in the ordinary way, and
was sent me by a master in a well known public school, the young son
who died has appeared in the plate seated between his two little
brothers.
