“Your gold is nothing to me,” said Aylward shortly, “nor would you buy
my loyalty if you filled my wallet with rose nobles, so long as you were
not a man after my own heart. But I have seen you back the yellow horse,
and I have seen you face the Abbot of Waverley, and you are such a
master as I would very gladly serve if you have by chance a place for
such a man. I have seen your following, and I doubt not that they were
stout fellows in your grandfather's time; but which of them now would
draw a bow-string to his ear? Through you I have left the service of the
Abbey of Waverley, and where can I look now for a post? If I stay here I
am all undone like a fretted bow-string.”
