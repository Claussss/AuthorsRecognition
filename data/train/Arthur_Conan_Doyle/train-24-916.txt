evergreen set in his helmet. “And a lad from Alresford!” shouted another. “And from Milton!” “And from Burley!” “And from Lymington!” “And a little one from Brockenhurst!” shouted a huge-limbed fellow who
sprawled beneath a tree. “By my hilt! lads,” cried Aylward, jumping upon the fallen trunk, “I
think that we could not look the girls in the eyes if we let the prince
cross the mountains and did not pull string to clear a path for him.

together, but now the war-banner is in the wind once more, and, by these
ten finger-bones! if he go alone, old Samkin Aylward will walk beside
it.”
