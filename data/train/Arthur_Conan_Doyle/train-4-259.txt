remarked. ‘Where is Monmouth to get his trained soldiers?’ ‘There is the militia,’ I suggested. ‘And there are many of the old parliamentary breed, who are not too far
gone to strike a blow for their belief,’ said Saxon. ‘Do you but get
half-a-dozen broad-brimmed, snuffle-nosed preachers into a camp, and the
whole Presbytery tribe will swarm round them like flies on a honey-pot.
No recruiting sergeants will ever raise such an army as did Noll’s
preachers in the eastern counties, where the promise of a seat by the
throne was thought of more value than a ten-pound bounty. I would I
could pay mine own debts with these same promises.’
