Upon September 25th the small garrison heard that the main force of the
Boers was sweeping towards them, and prepared to give them a soldiers'
welcome. The fort is situated upon the flank of a hill, on the summit of
which, a mile from the main trenches, a strong outpost was stationed.
It was upon this that the first force of the attack broke at midnight
of September 25th. The garrison, eighty strong, was fiercely beset by
several hundred Boers, and the post was eventually carried after a sharp
and bloody contest. Kane, of the South Lancashires, died with the
words 'No surrender' upon his lips, and Potgieter, a Boer leader, was
pistolled by Kane's fellow officer, Lefroy. Twenty of the small garrison
fell, and the remainder were overpowered and taken.
