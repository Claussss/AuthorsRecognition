“I should not be surprised to learn, mon camarade,” said the soldier, as
he heaped a slice of fish upon Alleyne's tranchoir of bread, “that you
could read written things, since you are so ready with your brushes and

against me. In the whole Company there was only one man who could read,
and he fell down a well at the taking of Ventadour, which proves that
the thing is not suited to a soldier, though most needful to a clerk.”
