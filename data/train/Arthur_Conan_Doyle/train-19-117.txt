May 4.  Why did I break off in this way last night?  I never went down
stairs, after all--at least, I have no recollection of doing so.  But,
on the other hand, I cannot remember going to bed.  One of my hands is
greatly swollen this morning, and yet I have no remembrance of injuring
it yesterday.  Otherwise, I am feeling all the better for last night's
festivity.  But I cannot understand how it is that I did not meet
Charles Sadler when I so fully intended to do so.  Is it possible----
My God, it is only too probable!  Has she been leading me some devil's
dance again?  I will go down to Sadler and ask him.
