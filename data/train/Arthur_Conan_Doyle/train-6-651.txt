The Black Prince, with the Lion, the Grace Marie and four other ships
had swept round to turn the Spanish flank; but the movement was seen,
and the Spaniards had ten ships with which to meet it, one of them their
great carack the St. Iago di Compostella. To this ship the Prince had
attached his little cog and strove desperately to board her, but her
side was so high and the defense so desperate that his men could never
get beyond her bulwarks but were hurled down again and again with a
clang and clash to the deck beneath. Her side bristled with crossbowmen,
who shot straight down on to the packed waist of the Lion, so that the
dead lay there in heaps. But the most dangerous of all was a swarthy
black-bearded giant in the tops, who crouched so that none could see
him, but rising every now and then with a huge lump of iron between his
hands, hurled it down with such force that nothing would stop it. Again
and again these ponderous bolts crashed through the deck and hurtled
down into the bottom of the ship, starting the planks and shattering all
that came in their way.
