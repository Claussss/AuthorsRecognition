A low murmur ran round the room, partly wonder at his frankness, and
partly anger at his boldness. The Abbot settled down in his seat as one who has made up his mind. “Let
the case of the summoner be laid before me,” said he. “Justice shall be
done, and the offender shall be punished, be he noble or simple. Let the
plaint be brought before the court.” The tale of the summoner, though rambling and filled with endless legal
reiteration, was only too clear in its essence. Red Swire, with his
angry face framed in white bristles, was led in, and confessed to his
ill treatment of the official. A second culprit, a little wiry nut-brown
archer from Churt, had aided and abetted in the deed. Both of them were
ready to declare that young Squire Nigel Loring knew nothing of the
matter. But then there was the awkward incident of the tearing of the
writs. Nigel, to whom a lie was an impossibility, had to admit that with
his own hands he had shredded those august documents. As to an excuse or
an explanation, he was too proud to advance any. A cloud gathered over
the brow of the Abbot, and the sacrist gazed with an ironical smile at
the prisoner, while a solemn hush fell over the chapter-house as the
case ended and only, judgment remained.
