      “I should be proud to feel that we were acting together, Mr.
      Holmes,” said the inspector, earnestly.       “In that case I should be glad to hear the evidence and to
      examine the premises without an instant of unnecessary delay.”       Inspector Martin had the good sense to allow my friend to do
      things in his own fashion, and contented himself with carefully
      noting the results. The local surgeon, an old, white-haired man,
      had just come down from Mrs. Hilton Cubitt’s room, and he
      reported that her injuries were serious, but not necessarily
      fatal. The bullet had passed through the front of her brain, and
      it would probably be some time before she could regain
      consciousness. On the question of whether she had been shot or
      had shot herself, he would not venture to express any decided
      opinion. Certainly the bullet had been discharged at very close
      quarters. There was only the one pistol found in the room, two
      barrels of which had been emptied. Mr. Hilton Cubitt had been
      shot through the heart. It was equally conceivable that he had
      shot her and then himself, or that she had been the criminal, for
      the revolver lay upon the floor midway between them.
