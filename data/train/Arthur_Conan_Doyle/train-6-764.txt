“I have made inquiry of the peasants,” Knolles answered, “and they are
of one mind that there is a well within the castle, and good store of
food. Nay, gentlemen, there is no way before us save to take it by arms,
and no spot where we can attempt it save through the great gate. Soon we
will have so many fagots that we can cast them down into the ditch, and
so win our way across. I have ordered them to cut a pine-tree on the
hill and shear the branches so that we may beat down the gate with it.
But what is now amiss, and why do they run forward to the castle?”
