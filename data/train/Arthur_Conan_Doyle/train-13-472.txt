VIII. The Crooked Man       One summer night, a few months after my marriage, I was seated by
      my own hearth smoking a last pipe and nodding over a novel, for
      my dayâ€™s work had been an exhausting one. My wife had already
      gone upstairs, and the sound of the locking of the hall door some
      time before told me that the servants had also retired. I had
      risen from my seat and was knocking out the ashes of my pipe when
      I suddenly heard the clang of the bell.
