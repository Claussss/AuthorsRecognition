About five o'clock we inspanned, to use an Africanism, and by six we
were well on our way, with our escort as straggling and unconcerned as
possible--as helpless-looking a caravan as ever invited attack. I could soon see that it was to be no false alarm this time, and that
the tribes really meant business. From my post of observation, under the canvas screens of one of the
waggons, I could make out turbaned heads popping up to have a look at
us from among the rocks, and an occasional scout hurrying northward with
the news of our approach.
