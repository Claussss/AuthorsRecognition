In a recent case I was called in to endeavour to check a very noisy
entity which frequented an old house in which there were strong reasons
to believe that crime had been committed, and also that the criminal
was earth-bound.  Names were given by the unhappy spirit which proved
to be correct, and a cupboard was described, which was duly found,
though it had never before been suspected.  On getting into touch with
the spirit I endeavoured to reason with it and to explain how selfish
it was to cause misery to others in order to satisfy any feelings of
revenge which it might have carried over from earth life.  We then
prayed for its welfare, exhorted it to rise higher, and received a very
solemn assurance, tilted out at the table, that it would mend its ways.
I have very gratifying reports that it has done so, and that all is now
quiet in the old house.
