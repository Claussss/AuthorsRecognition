The chief stood for some minutes, stroking his black beard, while his
fierce eyes glanced from one pale face to another along the miserable
line of his captives. In a harsh, imperious voice he said something
which brought Mansoor, the dragoman, to the front, with bent back and
outstretched, supplicating palms. To his employers there had always
seemed to be something comic in that flapping skirt and short cover-coat
above it; but now, under the glare of the mid-day sun, with those faces
gathered round them, it appeared rather to add a grotesque horror to
the scene. The dragoman salaamed like some ungainly, automatic doll, and
then, as the chief rasped out a curt word or two, he fell suddenly upon
his face, rubbing his forehead into the sand, and flapping upon it with
his hands.
