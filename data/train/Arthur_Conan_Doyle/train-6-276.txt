trouble has he, that he should hang his head?” “Perchance he hath a weak neck,” said the King. “At least he hath no weak voice,” the Prince remarked, as Nigel's answer
to Chandos came to their ears. “By our lady, he booms like a bittern.” As Chandos rode back again to the King, Nigel exchanged the old ash
spear which had been his father's for one of the blunted tournament
lances which he took from the hands of a stout archer in attendance. He
then rode down to the end of the bridge where a hundred-yard stretch
of greensward lay in front of him. At the same moment the Squire of
Sir Walter Manny, who had been hastily armed by his comrades, spurred
forward and took up his position.
