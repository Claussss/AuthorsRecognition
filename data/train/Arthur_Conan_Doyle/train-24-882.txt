As he spoke, a dozen men rushed forward, each screening himself behind a
huge fardel of brushwood. Hurling their burdens in one vast heap within
the portal, they threw burning torches upon the top of it. The wood
had been soaked in oil, for in an instant it was ablaze, and a long,
hissing, yellow flame licked over the heads of the defenders, and drove
them further up to the first floor of the keep. They had scarce reached
it, however, ere they found that the wooden joists and planks of the
flooring were already on fire. Dry and worm-eaten, a spark upon them
became a smoulder, and a smoulder a blaze. A choking smoke filled the
air, and the five could scarce grope their way to the staircase which
led up to the very summit of the square tower.
