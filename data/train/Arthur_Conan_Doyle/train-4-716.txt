The fog lay thick upon the Channel, but all inland was very clear and
bright. Along the coast the country was dreary and marshy, but at the
other side a goodly extent of fertile plain lay before me, well tilled
and cared for. A range of lofty hills, which I guessed to be the
Mendips, bordered the whole skyline, and further north there lay a
second chain in the blue distance. The glittering Avon wound its way
over the country-side like a silver snake in a flower-bed. Close to its
mouth, and not more than two leagues from where I stood, rose the spires
and towers of stately Bristol, the Queen of the West, which was and
still may be the second city in the kingdom. The forests of masts which
shot up like a pinegrove above the roofs of the houses bore witness to
the great trade both with Ireland and with the Plantations which had
built up so flourishing a city.
