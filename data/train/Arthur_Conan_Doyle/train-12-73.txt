“With the greatest pleasure,” said Robert eagerly. The proposition filled his heart with joy, for it seemed to give him an
almost official connection with this paradise of a house. He could not
have asked for anything more to his taste. “I was fortunate enough to discover by your conversation how high a
ground you take in such matters, and how entirely disinterested you
are. You may have observed that I was short and almost rude with you at
first. I have had reason to fear and suspect all chance friendships.
Too often they have proved to be carefully planned beforehand, with some
sordid object in view. Good heavens, what stories I could tell you!
A lady pursued by a bull--I have risked my life to save her, and have
learned afterwards that the scene had been arranged by the mother as an
effective introduction, and that the bull had been hired by the hour.
But I won't shake your faith in human nature. I have had some rude
shocks myself. I look, perhaps, with a jaundiced eye on all who come
near me. It is the more needful that I should have one whom I can trust
to advise me.”
