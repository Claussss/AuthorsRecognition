      â€œMy nerves are fairly proof, Watson, but I must confess to a
      start when I saw the very man who had been so much in my thoughts
      standing there on my threshhold. His appearance was quite
      familiar to me. He is extremely tall and thin, his forehead domes
      out in a white curve, and his two eyes are deeply sunken in his
      head. He is clean-shaven, pale, and ascetic-looking, retaining
      something of the professor in his features. His shoulders are
      rounded from much study, and his face protrudes forward, and is
      forever slowly oscillating from side to side in a curiously
      reptilian fashion. He peered at me with great curiosity in his
      puckered eyes.
