â€œAs it died slowly away, there was a rasping and creaking as of keys
and bolts, followed by the clang of an opening door and the clatter of
hurrying feet. From my window I saw my father and Corporal Rufus Smith
rush frantically out of the house hatless and unkempt, like men who are
obeying a sudden and overpowering impulse. The three strangers laid
no hands on them, but all five swept swiftly away down the avenue and
vanished among the trees. I am positive that no force was used, or
constraint of any visible kind, and yet I am as sure that my poor father
and his companion were helpless prisoners as if I had seen them dragged
away in manacles.
