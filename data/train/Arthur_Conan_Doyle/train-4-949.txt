‘Perhaps it would be best so,’ Saxon answered, full of thought, ‘and yet
no doubt the fellow would have some tale prepared which would outweigh
our mere suspicions. Could we not take him in the very act?’ A thought slipped into my head. I had observed from the tower that there
was a single lonely cottage about a third of the way to the enemy’s
camp, standing by the road at a place where there were marshes on either
side. Any one journeying that way must pass it. If Derrick tried to
carry our plans to Feversham he might be cut off at this point by a
party placed to lie in wait for him.
