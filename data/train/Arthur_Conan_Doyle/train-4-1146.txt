Well, my dear grandchildren, from night to night through this long and
weary winter I have taken you back with me into the past, and made you
see scenes the players in which are all beneath the turf, save
that perhaps here and there some greybeard like myself may have a
recollection of them. I understand that you, Joseph, have every morning
set down upon paper that which I have narrated the night before. It is
as well that you should do so, for your own children and your childrenâ€™s
children may find it of interest, and even perhaps take a pride in
hearing that their ancestors played a part in such scenes. But now
the spring is coming, and the green is bare of snow, so that there are
better things for you to do than to sit listening to the stories of
a garrulous old man. Nay, nay, you shake your heads, but indeed those
young limbs want exercising and strengthening and knitting together,
which can never come from sitting toasting round the blaze. Besides, my
story draws quickly to an end now, for I had never intended to tell you
more than the events connected with the Western rising. If the closing
part hath been of the dreariest, and if all doth not wind up with
the ringing of bells and the joining of hands, like the tales in the
chap-books, you must blame history and not me. For Truth is a stern
mistress, and when one hath once started off with her one must follow
on after the jade, though she lead in flat defiance of all the rules and
conditions which would fain turn that tangled wilderness the world into
the trim Dutch garden of the story-tellers.
