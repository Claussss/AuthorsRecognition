"And Lord Arthur has it." The Prime Minister chuckled over his little piece of roguery. "We have just decided it," he continued. "Lord Arthur must go in a week.  I am delighted to perceive, Lady
Clara, that the appointment has your approval.  Tangier is a place of
extraordinary interest.  Catherine of Braganza and Colonel Kirke will
occur to your memory.  Burton has written well upon Northern Africa.  I
dine at Windsor, so I am sure that you will excuse my leaving you.  I
trust that Lord Charles will be better.  He can hardly fail to be so
with such a nurse."
