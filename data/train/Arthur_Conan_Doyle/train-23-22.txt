In the early days, about 1863, a book was written by Mrs. de Morgan,
the wife of the well-known mathematician Professor de Morgan, entitled
"From Matter to Spirit."  There is a sympathetic preface by the
husband.  The book is still well worth reading, for it is a question
whether anyone has shown greater brain power in treating the subject.
In it the prophecy is made that as the movement develops the more
material phenomena will decrease and their place be taken by the more
spiritual, such as automatic writing.  This forecast has been
fulfilled, for though physical mediums still exist the other more
subtle forms greatly predominate, and call for far more discriminating
criticism in judging their value and their truth.  Two very convincing
forms of mediumship, the direct voice and spirit photography, have also
become prominent.  Each of these presents such proof that it is
impossible for the sceptic to face them, and he can only avoid them by
ignoring them.
