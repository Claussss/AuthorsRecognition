“I guess you are right.” “This is how I should work it. You will all be in the big room--same as
you saw when you had a chat with me. I'll open the door for him, show
him into the parlour beside the door, and leave him there while I get
the papers. That will give me the chance of telling you how things are
shaping. Then I will go back to him with some faked papers. As he is
reading them I will jump for him and get my grip on his pistol arm.
You'll hear me call and in you will rush. The quicker the better; for
he is as strong a man as I, and I may have more than I can manage. But I
allow that I can hold him till you come.”
