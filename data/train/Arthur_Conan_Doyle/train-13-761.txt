      Percy Phelps sank back in his chair. “My head whirls,” said he.
      “Your words have dazed me.”       “The principal difficulty in your case,” remarked Holmes, in his

      evidence. What was vital was overlaid and hidden by what was
      irrelevant. Of all the facts which were presented to us we had to
      pick just those which we deemed to be essential, and then piece
      them together in their order, so as to reconstruct this very
      remarkable chain of events. I had already begun to suspect
      Joseph, from the fact that you had intended to travel home with
      him that night, and that therefore it was a likely enough thing
      that he should call for you, knowing the Foreign Office well,
      upon his way. When I heard that some one had been so anxious to
      get into the bedroom, in which no one but Joseph could have
      concealed anything—you told us in your narrative how you had
      turned Joseph out when you arrived with the doctor—my suspicions
      all changed to certainties, especially as the attempt was made on
      the first night upon which the nurse was absent, showing that the
      intruder was well acquainted with the ways of the house.”
