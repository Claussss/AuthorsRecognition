      “Well, now I come to the queer part of my story. About a week
      ago—it was the Tuesday of last week—I found on one of the
      window-sills a number of absurd little dancing figures like these
      upon the paper. They were scrawled with chalk. I thought that it
      was the stable-boy who had drawn them, but the lad swore he knew
      nothing about it. Anyhow, they had come there during the night. I
      had them washed out, and I only mentioned the matter to my wife
      afterwards. To my surprise, she took it very seriously, and
      begged me if any more came to let her see them. None did come for
      a week, and then yesterday morning I found this paper lying on
      the sundial in the garden. I showed it to Elsie, and down she
      dropped in a dead faint. Since then she has looked like a woman
      in a dream, half dazed, and with terror always lurking in her
      eyes. It was then that I wrote and sent the paper to you, Mr.
      Holmes. It was not a thing that I could take to the police, for
      they would have laughed at me, but you will tell me what to do. I
      am not a rich man, but if there is any danger threatening my
      little woman, I would spend my last copper to shield her.”
