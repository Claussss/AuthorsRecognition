Sir Nigel Loring lived for many years, full of honor and laden with
every blessing. He rode no more to the wars, but he found his way to
every jousting within thirty miles; and the Hampshire youth treasured
it as the highest honor when a word of praise fell from him as to their
management of their horses, or their breaking of their lances. So he
lived and so he died, the most revered and the happiest man in all his
native shire.
