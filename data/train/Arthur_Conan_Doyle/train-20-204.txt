      “She broke away from your influence when she found the man that
      you are,” said Holmes, sternly. “She fled from America to avoid
      you, and she married an honourable gentleman in England. You
      dogged her and followed her and made her life a misery to her, in
      order to induce her to abandon the husband whom she loved and
      respected in order to fly with you, whom she feared and hated.
      You have ended by bringing about the death of a noble man and
      driving his wife to suicide. That is your record in this
      business, Mr. Abe Slaney, and you will answer for it to the law.”
