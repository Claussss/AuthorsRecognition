Well, now, if you had to choose your team whom would you put in? You
have not really a large choice. What are the points by which you
judge them? You want strength, novelty, compactness, intensity of
interest, a single vivid impression left upon the mind. Poe is the
master of all. I may remark by the way that it is the sight of his
green cover, the next in order upon my favourite shelf, which has
started this train of thought. Poe is, to my mind, the supreme
original short story writer of all time. His brain was like a
seed-pod full of seeds which flew carelessly around, and from which
have sprung nearly all our modern types of story. Just think of
what he did in his offhand, prodigal fashion, seldom troubling to
repeat a success, but pushing on to some new achievement. To him
must be ascribed the monstrous progeny of writers on the detection
of crime--"quorum pars parva fui!" Each may find some little
development of his own, but his main art must trace back to those
admirable stories of Monsieur Dupin, so wonderful in their masterful
force, their reticence, their quick dramatic point. After all,
mental acuteness is the one quality which can be ascribed to the
ideal detective, and when that has once been admirably done,
succeeding writers must necessarily be content for all time to
follow in the same main track. But not only is Poe the originator
of the detective story; all treasure-hunting, cryptogram-solving
yarns trace back to his "Gold Bug," just as all pseudo-scientific
Verne-and-Wells stories have their prototypes in the "Voyage to
the Moon," and the "Case of Monsieur Valdemar." If every man who
receives a cheque for a story which owes its springs to Poe were to
pay tithe to a monument for the master, he would have a pyramid as
big as that of Cheops.
