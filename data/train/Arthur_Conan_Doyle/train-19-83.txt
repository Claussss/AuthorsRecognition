"Austin," she whispered, "I have tried to do too much.  I was not
strong enough.  I have not recovered yet from my illness.  But I could
not live longer without seeing you.  You won't leave me, Austin?  This
is only a passing weakness.  If you will only give me five minutes, I
shall be myself again.  Give me the small decanter from the table in
the window." But I had regained my soul.  With her waning strength the influence had
cleared away from me and left me free.  And I was aggressive--bitterly,
fiercely aggressive.  For once at least I could make this woman
understand what my real feelings toward her were.  My soul was filled
with a hatred as bestial as the love against which it was a reaction.
It was the savage, murderous passion of the revolted serf.  I could
have taken the crutch from her side and beaten her face in with it.
She threw her hands up, as if to avoid a blow, and cowered away from me
into the corner of the settee.
