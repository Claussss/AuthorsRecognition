‘Nay, nay,’ said the alchemist, smiling and shaking his head. ‘It can
indeed be done, but only slowly and in order, small pieces at a time,
and with much expenditure of work and patience. For a man to enrich
himself at it he must labour hard and long; yet in the end I will not
deny that he may compass it. And now, since the flasks are empty and
your young comrade is nodding in his chair, it will perhaps be as well
for you to spend as much of the night as is left in repose.’ He drew
several blankets and rugs from a corner and scattered them over the
floor. ‘It is a soldier’s couch,’ he remarked; ‘but ye may sleep on
worse before ye put Monmouth on the English throne. For myself, it is
my custom to sleep in an inside chamber, which is hollowed out of the
hill.’ With a few last words and precautions for our comfort he withdrew
with the lamp, passing through a door which had escaped our notice at
the further end of the apartment.
