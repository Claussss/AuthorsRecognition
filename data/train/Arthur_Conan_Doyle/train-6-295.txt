The great influx of foreign knights who had come in their splendor from
all parts of Christendom to take part in the opening of the Round Tower
of Windsor six years before, and to try their luck and their skill
at the tournament connected with it, had deeply modified the English
fashions of dress. The old tunic, over-tunic and cyclas were too sad and
simple for the new fashions, so now strange and brilliant cote-hardies,
pourpoints, courtepies, paltocks, hanselines and many other wondrous
garments, parti-colored or diapered, with looped, embroidered or
escalloped edges, flamed and glittered round the King. He himself, in
black velvet and gold, formed a dark rich center to the finery around
him. On his right sat the Prince, on his left the Bishop, while Dame
Ermyntrude marshaled the forces of the household outside, alert and
watchful, pouring in her dishes and her flagons at the right moment,
rallying her tired servants, encouraging the van, hurrying the rear,
hastening up her reserves, the tapping of her oak stick heard everywhere
the pressure was the greatest.
