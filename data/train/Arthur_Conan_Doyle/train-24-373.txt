Next day at morning lesson the teacher observed that his pupil was
indeed looking pale and jaded, with listless eyes and a weary manner. He
was heavy-hearted to note the grievous change in her. “Your mistress, I fear, is ill, Agatha,” he said to the tire-woman, when
the Lady Maude had sought her chamber. The maid looked aslant at him with laughing eyes. “It is not an illness
that kills,” quoth she.
