I don't know how those two little books got in there. They are
Henley's "Song of the Sword" and "Book of Verses." They ought to be
over yonder in the rather limited Poetry Section. Perhaps it is that
I like his work so, whether it be prose or verse, and so have put
them ready to my hand. He was a remarkable man, a man who was very
much greater than his work, great as some of his work was. I have
seldom known a personality more magnetic and stimulating. You left
his presence, as a battery leaves a generating station, charged up
and full. He made you feel what a lot of work there was to be done,
and how glorious it was to be able to do it, and how needful to get
started upon it that very hour. With the frame and the vitality of
a giant he was cruelly bereft of all outlet for his strength, and
so distilled it off in hot words, in warm sympathy, in strong
prejudices, in all manner of human and stimulating emotions. Much
of the time and energy which might have built an imperishable name
for himself was spent in encouraging others; but it was not waste,
for he left his broad thumb-mark upon all that passed beneath it.
A dozen second-hand Henleys are fortifying our literature to-day.
