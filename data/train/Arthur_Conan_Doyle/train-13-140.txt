      “But it was Sarah’s fault, and may the curse of a broken man put
      a blight on her and set the blood rotting in her veins! It’s not

      like the beast that I was. But she would have forgiven me; she
      would have stuck as close to me as a rope to a block if that
      woman had never darkened our door. For Sarah Cushing loved
      me—that’s the root of the business—she loved me until all her
      love turned to poisonous hate when she knew that I thought more
      of my wife’s footmark in the mud than I did of her whole body and
      soul.
