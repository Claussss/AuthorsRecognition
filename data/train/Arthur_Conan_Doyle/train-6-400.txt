“Well spoken, on my faith, my golden bird!” said the little master of
Shalford. “Let me add my own word to that which has been said. You would
not grant me any virtue in your unkindly speech, good Lady Mary, and
yet you must needs confess that at least I have good store of patience,
since I have not set my dogs upon your friends who have come between me
and my ease. But even to the most virtuous there comes at last a time
when poor human frailty may prevail, and so I pray you to remove both
yourself, your priest and your valiant knight errant, lest perhaps there
be more haste and less dignity when at last you do take your leave.
Sit down, my fair love, and let us turn once more to our supper.” He
motioned her to her chair, and he filled her wine-cup as well as his
own.
