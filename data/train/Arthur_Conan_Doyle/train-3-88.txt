Now came the night of my first lecture. It was in the city hall, and
every seat was occupied. It was a really magnificent audience of two
thousand people, the most representative of the town. I am an
embarrassed and an interested witness, so let me for this occasion quote
the sympathetic, not to say flattering account of the _Register_.      "There could not have been a more impressive set of circumstances
     than those which attended the first Australian lecture by Sir
     Arthur Conan Doyle at the Adelaide Town Hall on Saturday night,
     September 25th. The audience, large, representative and thoughtful,
     was in its calibre and proportions a fitting compliment to a world
     celebrity and his mission. Many of the intellectual leaders of the
     city were present--University professors, pulpit personalities,
     men eminent in business, legislators, every section of the
     community contributed a quota. It cannot be doubted, of course,
     that the brilliant literary fame of the lecturer was an attraction
     added to that strange subject which explored the 'unknown drama of
     the soul.' Over all Sir Arthur dominated by his big arresting
     presence. His face has a rugged, kindly strength, tense and earnest
     in its grave moments, and full of winning animation when the sun of
     his rich humour plays on the powerful features."
