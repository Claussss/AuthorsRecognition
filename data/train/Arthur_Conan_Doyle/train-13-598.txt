      “That he has not left the service long is shown by his still
      wearing his ammunition boots, as they are called,” observed
      Mycroft.       “He had not the cavalry stride, yet he wore his hat on one side,
      as is shown by the lighter skin of that side of his brow. His
      weight is against his being a sapper. He is in the artillery.”       “Then, of course, his complete mourning shows that he has lost
      some one very dear. The fact that he is doing his own shopping
      looks as though it were his wife. He has been buying things for
      children, you perceive. There is a rattle, which shows that one
      of them is very young. The wife probably died in childbed. The
      fact that he has a picture-book under his arm shows that there is
      another child to be thought of.”
