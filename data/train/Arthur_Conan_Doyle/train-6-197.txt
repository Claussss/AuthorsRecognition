“Have a care,” they added, “for the 'Wild Man' and his wife are out.
Only yesterday they slew a merchant from the west and took a hundred
crowns.” “His wife, you say?” “Yes, she is ever at his side, and has saved him many a time, for if he
has the strength it is she who has the wit. I hope to see their heads
together upon the green grass one of these mornings.” The patrol passed downward toward Farnham, and so, as it proved, away
from the robbers, who had doubtless watched them closely from the
dense brushwood which skirted the road. Coming round a curve, Nigel and
Aylward were aware of a tall and graceful woman who sat, wringing her
hands and weeping bitterly, upon the bank by the side of the track. At
such a sight of beauty in distress Nigel pricked Pommers with the spur
and in three bounds was at the side of the unhappy lady.
