Maister Fothergill West says I maunna express an opeenion as tae what
cam aboot afterwards, but maun confine mysel' tae what I saw mysel'. Nae
doubt he has his reasons for this--and far be it frae me tae hint that
they are no' guid anes--but I maun say this, that what happened didna
surprise me. It was just as I expeckit, and so I said tae Maister Donald
McSnaw. I've tauld ye a' aboot it noo, and I havena a word tae add or tae
withdraw. I'm muckle obleeged tae Maister Mathew Clairk for puttin'
it a' doon in writin' for me, and if there's ony would wish tae speer
onything mair o' me I'm well kenned and respeckit in Ecclefechan, and
Maister McNeil, the factor o' Wigtown, can aye tell where I am tae be
foond.
