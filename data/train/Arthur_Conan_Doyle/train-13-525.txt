IX. The Resident Patient       In glancing over the somewhat incoherent series of memoirs with
      which I have endeavoured to illustrate a few of the mental
      peculiarities of my friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I have been
      struck by the difficulty which I have experienced in picking out
      examples which shall in every way answer my purpose. For in those
      cases in which Holmes has performed some _tour-de-force_ of
      analytical reasoning, and has demonstrated the value of his
      peculiar methods of investigation, the facts themselves have
      often been so slight or so commonplace that I could not feel
      justified in laying them before the public. On the other hand, it
      has frequently happened that he has been concerned in some
      research where the facts have been of the most remarkable and
      dramatic character, but where the share which he has himself
      taken in determining their causes has been less pronounced than
      I, as his biographer, could wish. The small matter which I have
      chronicled under the heading of “A Study in Scarlet,” and that
      other later one connected with the loss of the _Gloria Scott_,
      may serve as examples of this Scylla and Charybdis which are
      forever threatening the historian. It may be that in the business
      of which I am now about to write the part which my friend played
      is not sufficiently accentuated; and yet the whole train of
      circumstances is so remarkable that I cannot bring myself to omit
      it entirely from this series.
