should I, when I bear you no ill-will? If you come against me, however,
I will assuredly beat you out of your saddle, for all your tricky sword
play.’ I drew my broadsword as I spoke, and stood upon my guard, for I
guessed that with so old a soldier the onset would be sharp and sudden. ‘By all the saints in heaven!’ cried Reuben, ‘which ever of ye strikes
first at the other I’ll snap this pistol at his head. None of your
jokes, Don Decimo, for by the Lord I’ll let drive at you if you were my
own mother’s son. Put up your sword, for the trigger falls easy, and my
finger is a twitching.’
