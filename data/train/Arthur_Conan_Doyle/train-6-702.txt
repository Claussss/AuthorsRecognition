The new-comers soon had a chance of seeing to what lengths they would
go, for in the roadway near to Caulnes they came upon an English
man-at-arms who had been waylaid and slain by them. How they had
overcome him could not be told, but how they had slain him within his
armor was horribly apparent, for they had carried such a rock as eight
men could lift, and had dropped it upon him as he lay, so that he was
spread out in his shattered case like a crab beneath a stone. Many a
fist was shaken at the distant woods and many a curse hurled at those
who haunted them, as the column of scowling soldiers passed the murdered
man, whose badge of the Molene cross showed him to have been a follower
of that House of Bentley, whose head, Sir Walter, was at that time
leader of the British forces in the country.
