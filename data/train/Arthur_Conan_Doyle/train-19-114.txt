10 P. M.  I have cleaned my coat with turpentine.  I do not think that
any one could have seen me.  It was with my screw-driver that I made
the marks.  I found it all crusted with paint, and I have cleaned it.
My head aches as if it would burst, and I have taken five grains of
antipyrine.  If it were not for Agatha, I should have taken fifty and
had an end of it. May 3.  Three quiet days.  This hell fiend is like a cat with a mouse.
She lets me loose only to pounce upon me again.  I am never so
frightened as when every thing is still.  My physical state is
deplorable--perpetual hiccough and ptosis of the left eyelid.
