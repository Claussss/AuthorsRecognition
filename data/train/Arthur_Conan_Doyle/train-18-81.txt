jests and tags of Oriental poems appropriate to the occasion, for we had
no secrets from him, and he already looked upon us all as his children. There were times when on account of some peculiarly dark or restless fit
of the general's it was impossible for weeks on end for either Gabriel
or Mordaunt to get away from the grounds. The old man would even stand
on guard, a gloomy and silent sentinel, at the avenue gate, or pace up
and down the drive as though he suspected that attempts had been made to
penetrate his seclusion.
