How far Mansoor may have gone with his assurances may never be known,
but the Mussulman preacher came walking towards them at this moment with
a paternal and contented smile upon his face, as one who has a pleasant
and easy task before him. He was a one-eyed man, with a fringe of
grizzled beard and a face which was fat, but which looked as if it had
once been fatter, for it was marked with many folds and creases. He had
a green turban upon his head, which marked him as a Mecca pilgrim. In
one hand he carried a small brown carpet, and in the other a parchment
copy of the Koran. Laying his carpet upon the ground, he motioned
Mansoor to his side, and then gave a circular sweep of his arm to
signify that the prisoners should gather round him, and a downward wave
which meant that they should be seated. So they grouped themselves round
him, sitting on the short green sward under the palm-tree, these seven
forlorn representatives of an alien creed, and in the midst of them sat
the fat little preacher, his one eye dancing from face to face as he
expounded the principles of his newer, cruder, and more earnest faith.
They listened attentively and nodded their heads as Mansoor translated
the exhortation, and with each sign of their acquiescence the Moolah
became more amiable in his manner and more affectionate in his speech.
