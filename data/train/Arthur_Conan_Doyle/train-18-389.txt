It was our turn now to assume the offensive. The guns were unlimbered
and grape poured into them, while our little infantry force advanced at
the double, shooting and stabbing all whom they overtook. Never had I known the tide of battle turn so rapidly and so decisively.
The sullen retreat became a flight, and the flight a panic-stricken
rout, until there was nothing left of the tribesmen except a scattered,
demoralised rabble flying wildly to their native fastnesses for shelter
and protection.
