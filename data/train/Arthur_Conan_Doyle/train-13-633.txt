      “Better pick up Mr. Melas on our way,” I suggested. “We may need
      an interpreter.”       “Excellent,” said Sherlock Holmes. “Send the boy for a
      four-wheeler, and we shall be off at once.” He opened the
      table-drawer as he spoke, and I noticed that he slipped his
      revolver into his pocket. “Yes,” said he, in answer to my glance;
      “I should say from what we have heard, that we are dealing with a
      particularly dangerous gang.”
