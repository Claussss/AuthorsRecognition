Breakfast had hardly been cleared in the morning, and Robert had not yet
ascended to his work, when there came a timid tapping at the door, and
there was Raffles Haw on the mat outside. Robert ran out and welcomed
him with all cordiality. “I am afraid that I am a very early visitor,” he said apologetically;
“but I often take a walk after breakfast.” He had no traces of work upon
him now, but was trim and neat with a dark suit, and carefully brushed
hair. “You spoke yesterday of your work. Perhaps, early as it is, you
would allow me the privilege of looking over your studio?”
