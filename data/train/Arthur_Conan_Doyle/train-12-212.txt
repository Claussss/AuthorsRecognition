“And a week's work!” gasped Robert. “It makes my head swim.” “You will follow me now when I repeat that none of the great schemes
which I intend to simultaneously set in motion are at all likely to
languish for want of funds. Now come into the laboratory with me and see
how it is done.” In the centre of the workroom was an instrument like a huge vice, with
two large brass-coloured plates, and a great steel screw for bringing
them together. Numerous wires ran into these metal plates, and were
attached at the other end to the rows of dynamic machines. Beneath was
a glass stand, which was hollowed out in the centre into a succession of
troughs.
