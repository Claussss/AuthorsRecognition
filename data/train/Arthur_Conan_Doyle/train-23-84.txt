It is interesting to observe the effect which these phenomena, or the
report of them, produced upon the orthodox Jews of those days.  The
greater part obviously discredited them, otherwise they could not have
failed to become followers, or at the least to have regarded such a
wonder-worker with respect and admiration.  One can well imagine how
they shook their bearded heads, declared that such occurrences were
outside their own experience, and possibly pointed to the local
conjuror who earned a few not over-clean denarii by imitating the
phenomena.  There were others, however, who could not possibly deny,
because they either saw or met with witnesses who had seen.  These
declared roundly that the whole thing was of the devil, drawing from
Christ one of those pithy, common-sense arguments in which He excelled.
The same two classes of opponents, the scoffers and the diabolists,
face us to-day.  Verily the old world goes round and so do the events
upon its surface.
