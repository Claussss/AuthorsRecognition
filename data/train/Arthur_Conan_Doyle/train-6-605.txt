Though small in numbers, it was no mean force which Edward had
dispatched to succor the hard-pressed English garrisons in Brittany.

Squire John Hawthorn. Of his hundred men, forty were Yorkshire Dalesmen
and forty were men of Lincoln, all noted archers, with old Wat of
Carlisle, a grizzled veteran of border warfare, to lead them.
