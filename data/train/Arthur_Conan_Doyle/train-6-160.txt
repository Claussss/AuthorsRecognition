“My good fellow,” said Nigel, “I have told you that I could in no wise
reward you for such service.” “If you will but take me to the wars I will see to my own reward,” said
Aylward. “Till then I ask for none, save a corner of your table and six
feet of your floor, for it is certain that the only reward I would get
from the Abbey for this day's work would be the scourge for my back and
the stocks for my ankles. Samkin Aylward is your man, Squire Nigel, from
this hour on, and by these ten finger-bones he trusts the Devil will
fly away with him if ever he gives you cause to regret it!” So saying he
raised his hand to his steel cap in salute, slung his great yellow bow
over his back, and followed on some paces in the rear of his new master.
