Sir Walter Woodland, riding hard upon his high black horse, had plunged
into the swelter and headed for the blue and silver banner of King John.
Close at his heels in a solid wedge rode the Prince, Chandos, Nigel,
Lord Reginald Cobham, Audley with his four famous squires, and a score
of the flower of the English and Gascon knighthood. Holding together and
bearing down opposition by a shower of blows and by the weight of their
powerful horses, their progress was still very slow, for ever fresh
waves of French cavaliers surged up against them and broke in front only
to close in again upon their rear. Sometimes they were swept backward
by the rush, sometimes they gained a few paces, sometimes they could but
keep their foothold, and yet from minute to minute that blue and silver
flag which waved above the press grew ever a little closer. A dozen
furious hard-breathing French knights had broken into their ranks, and
clutched at Sir Walter Woodland's banner, but Chandos and Nigel guarded
it on one side, Audley with his squires on the other, so that no man
laid his hand upon it and lived.
