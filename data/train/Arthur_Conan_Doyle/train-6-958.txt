“I would say a word to that, sire,” cried the German Count of Nassau, “I
have come here with my comrades to venture our persons in your quarrel;
but we claim the right to fight in our own fashion, and we would count
it dishonor to dismount from our steeds out of fear of the arrows of the
English. Therefore, with your permission, we will ride to the front,
as the Duke of Athens has advised, and so clear a path for the rest of
you.”
