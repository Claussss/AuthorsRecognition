Just one word upon another eighteenth-century novel before I finish
this somewhat didactic chat. You will admit that I have never prosed
so much before, but the period and the subject seem to encourage
it. I skip Sterne, for I have no great sympathy with his finicky
methods. And I skip Miss Burney's novels, as being feminine
reflections of the great masters who had just preceded her. But
Goldsmith's "Vicar of Wakefield" surely deserves one paragraph to
itself. There is a book which is tinged throughout, as was all
Goldsmith's work, with a beautiful nature. No one who had not a fine
heart could have written it, just as no one without a fine heart
could have written "The Deserted Village." How strange it is to
think of old Johnson patronizing or snubbing the shrinking Irishman,
when both in poetry, in fiction, and in the drama the latter has
proved himself far the greater man. But here is an object-lesson of
how the facts of life may be treated without offence. Nothing is
shirked. It is all faced and duly recorded. Yet if I wished to set
before the sensitive mind of a young girl a book which would prepare
her for life without in any way contaminating her delicacy of
feeling, there is no book which I should choose so readily as "The
Vicar of Wakefield."
