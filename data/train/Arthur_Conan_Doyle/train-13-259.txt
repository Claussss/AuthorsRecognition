      Following his lead, we ascended five stories, until we found
      ourselves outside a half-opened door, at which our client tapped.
      A voice within bade us enter, and we entered a bare, unfurnished
      room such as Hall Pycroft had described. At the single table sat
      the man whom we had seen in the street, with his evening paper
      spread out in front of him, and as he looked up at us it seemed
      to me that I had never looked upon a face which bore such marks
      of grief, and of something beyond grief—of a horror such as comes
      to few men in a lifetime. His brow glistened with perspiration,
      his cheeks were of the dull, dead white of a fish’s belly, and
      his eyes were wild and staring. He looked at his clerk as though
      he failed to recognise him, and I could see by the astonishment
      depicted upon our conductor’s face that this was by no means the
      usual appearance of his employer.
