‘There is a right and there is a wrong,’ I answered, ‘which no words
can do away with, and it is a dangerous and unprofitable trick to juggle
with them.’ ‘Besides, even if what you have said were true as to property,’ Sir
Gervas remarked, ‘it would not hold you excused for that recklessness of
human life which your trade begets.’ ‘Nay! it is but hunting, save that your quarry may at any time turn
round upon you, and become in turn the hunter. It is, as you say, a
dangerous game, but two can play at it, and each has an equal chance.
There is no loading of the dice, or throwing of fulhams. Now it was but
a few days back that, riding down the high-road, I perceived three jolly
farmers at full gallop across the fields with a leash of dogs yelping in
front of them, and all in pursuit of one little harmless bunny. It was
a bare and unpeopled countryside on the border of Exmoor, so I bethought
me that I could not employ my leisure better than by chasing the
chasers. Odd’s wouns! it was a proper hunt. Away went my gentlemen,
whooping like madmen, with their coat skirts flapping in the breeze,
chivying on the dogs, and having a rare morning’s sport. They never
marked the quiet horseman who rode behind them, and who without a
“yoick!” or “hark-a-way!” was relishing his chase with the loudest of
them. It needed but a posse of peace officers at my heels to make up a
brave string of us, catch-who-catch-can, like the game the lads play on
the village green.’
