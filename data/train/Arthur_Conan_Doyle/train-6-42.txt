“Come then,” cried the Abbot, “let us see with our own eyes what evil
has been done.” And the three monks hurried down the stair which led to the cloisters. They had no sooner descended than their more pressing fears were set at
rest, for at that very moment, limping, disheveled and mud-stained, the
two sufferers were being led in amid a crowd of sympathizing brethren.
Shouts and cries from outside showed, however, that some further drama
was in progress, and both Abbot and sacrist hastened onward as fast
as the dignity of their office would permit, until they had passed the
gates and gained the wall of the meadow. Looking over it, a remarkable
sight presented itself to their eyes.
