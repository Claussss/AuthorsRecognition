The intelligent brute sniffed at it all over, then ran whining a little
way down the avenue, came back to sniff the coat again, and finally
elevating its stump of a tail in triumph, uttered a succession of sharp
yelps to show that it was satisfied that it had struck the trail. Its
owner tied a long cord to its collar to prevent it from going too fast
for us, and we all set off upon our search, the dog tugging and
straining at its leash in its excitement as it followed in the general's
footsteps.
