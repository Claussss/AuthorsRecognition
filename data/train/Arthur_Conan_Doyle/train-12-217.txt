“We will devote one of them to experiment,” said he, leaving the last
standing upon the glass insulator. “To the world it would seem an
expensive demonstration which cost two thousand pounds, but our
standard, you see, is a different one. Now you will see me run through
the whole gamut of metallic nature.” First of all men after the discoverer, Robert saw the gold mass, when
the electrodes were again applied to it, change swiftly and successively
to barium, to tin, to silver, to copper, to iron. He saw the long white
electric sparks change to crimson with the strontium, to purple with the
potassium, to yellow with the manganese. Then, finally, after a hundred
transformations, it disintegrated before his eyes, and lay as a little
mound of fluffy grey dust upon the glass table.
