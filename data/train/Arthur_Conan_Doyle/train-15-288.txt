As I stood in the darkness, wrapped in my scarlet chlamys--for the
evenings here are chill--I was suddenly aware that I was not alone. A
tall, silent figure was near me, looking down at the town even as I was.
I could see in the moonlight that he was clad as an officer, and as I
approached him I recognized that it was Longinus, third tribune of my
own legion, and a soldier of great age and experience. He is a strange,
silent man, who is respected by all, but understood by none, for he
keeps his own council and thinks rather than talks. As I approached him
the first flames burst from the temple, a high column of fire, which
cast a glow upon our faces and gleamed upon our armour. In this red
light I saw that the gaunt face of my companion was set like iron.
