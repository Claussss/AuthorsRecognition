It had been my habit to pull out of an evening in the laird's skiff
and to catch a few whiting which might serve for our supper. On this
well-remembered occasion my sister came with me, sitting with her book
in the stern-sheets of the boat, while I hung my lines over the bows. The sun had sunk down behind the rugged Irish coast, but a long bank of
flushed cloud still marked the spot, and cast a glory upon the waters.
The whole broad ocean was seamed and scarred with crimson streaks. I had
risen in the boat, and was gazing round in delight at the broad panorama
of shore and sea and sky, when my sister plucked at my sleeve with a
little, sharp cry of surprise.
