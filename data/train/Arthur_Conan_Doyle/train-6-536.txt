Then betwixt them and the mast the two figures: the armed shining man
of metal, with hand upraised, watchful, silent, motionless, and Nigel,
bareheaded and crouching, with quick foot, eager eyes and fearless happy
face, moving this way and that, in and out, his sword flashing like a
gleam of light as he sought at all points for some opening in the brazen
shell before him. It was clear to the man in armor that if he could but pen his antagonist
in a corner he would beat him down without fail. But it was not to be
done. The unhampered man had the advantage of speed. With a few quick
steps he could always glide to either side and escape the clumsy rush.
Aylward and Badding had sprung out to Nigel's assistance; but he shouted
to them to stand back, with such authority and anger in his voice that
their weapons dropped to their sides. With staring eyes and set features
they stood watching that unequal fight.
