“Well, that is one suggestion, Mr. Holmes.” “The other is that it has been engineered by Moriarty in the ordinary
course of business. Was there any robbery?” “I have not heard.” “If so, it would, of course, be against the first hypothesis and in
favour of the second. Moriarty may have been engaged to engineer it on a
promise of part spoils, or he may have been paid so much down to manage
it. Either is possible. But whichever it may be, or if it is some third
combination, it is down at Birlstone that we must seek the solution. I
know our man too well to suppose that he has left anything up here which
may lead us to him.”
