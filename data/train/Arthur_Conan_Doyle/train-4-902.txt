‘For Christ’s zake, zur,’ cried one of them, an old ruddy-faced
countryman, ‘move the bodies o’ these soldier rogues into the road, and
let it zeem as how they have perished in a chance fight wi’ your own
troopers loike. Should it be known as they have met their end within
a varmhouse, there will not be a thatch left unlighted over t’ whole
country side; as it is, us can scarce keep these murthering Tangiers
devils from oor throats.’
