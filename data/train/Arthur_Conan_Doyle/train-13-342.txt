VI. The Musgrave Ritual       An anomaly which often struck me in the character of my friend
      Sherlock Holmes was that, although in his methods of thought he
      was the neatest and most methodical of mankind, and although also
      he affected a certain quiet primness of dress, he was none the
      less in his personal habits one of the most untidy men that ever
      drove a fellow-lodger to distraction. Not that I am in the least
      conventional in that respect myself. The rough-and-tumble work in
      Afghanistan, coming on the top of a natural Bohemianism of
      disposition, has made me rather more lax than befits a medical
      man. But with me there is a limit, and when I find a man who
      keeps his cigars in the coal-scuttle, his tobacco in the toe end
      of a Persian slipper, and his unanswered correspondence
      transfixed by a jack-knife into the very centre of his wooden
      mantelpiece, then I begin to give myself virtuous airs. I have
      always held, too, that pistol practice should be distinctly an
      open-air pastime; and when Holmes, in one of his queer humours,
      would sit in an armchair with his hair-trigger and a hundred
      Boxer cartridges, and proceed to adorn the opposite wall with a
      patriotic V. R. done in bullet-pocks, I felt strongly that
      neither the atmosphere nor the appearance of our room was
      improved by it.
