“How is that?” I asked when I had finished. “Capital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man. I was
very weak, but I have had a good deal to go through.” “Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently trying
to your nerves.” “Oh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but,
between ourselves, if it were not for the convincing evidence of this
wound of mine, I should be surprised if they believed my statement, for
it is a very extraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof
with which to back it up; and, even if they believe me, the clues which
I can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will
be done.”
