is in the hollow all the way.’ ‘Lead the horses until we get on better ground,’ I answered. ‘We may

track, sliding and slipping on the rain-soaked turf. Springing into our
saddles we dashed down the gorge, through the grove, and so out on to
the road in time to see the troop disappear in the distance, and to meet
the solitary officer face to face.
