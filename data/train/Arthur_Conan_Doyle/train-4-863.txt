‘All battles are but chance work, your Majesty,’ remarked Saxon, whose
sword-arm was bound round with his kerchief. ‘Some lucky turn, some slip
or chance which none can foresee, is ever likely to turn the scale. I
have lost when I have looked to win, and I have won when I have looked
to lose. It is an uncertain game, and one never knows the finish till
the last card is played.’ ‘Not till the stakes are drawn,’ said Buyse, in his deep guttural voice.
‘There is many a leader that wins what you call the trick, and yet loses
the game.’
