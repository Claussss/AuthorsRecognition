      “You know my methods in such cases, Watson. I put myself in the
      man’s place and, having first gauged his intelligence, I try to
      imagine how I should myself have proceeded under the same
      circumstances. In this case the matter was simplified by
      Brunton’s intelligence being quite first-rate, so that it was
      unnecessary to make any allowance for the personal equation, as
      the astronomers have dubbed it. He knew that something valuable
      was concealed. He had spotted the place. He found that the stone
      which covered it was just too heavy for a man to move unaided.
      What would he do next? He could not get help from outside, even
      if he had some one whom he could trust, without the unbarring of
      doors and considerable risk of detection. It was better, if he
      could, to have his helpmate inside the house. But whom could he
      ask? This girl had been devoted to him. A man always finds it
      hard to realize that he may have finally lost a woman’s love,
      however badly he may have treated her. He would try by a few
      attentions to make his peace with the girl Howells, and then
      would engage her as his accomplice. Together they would come at
      night to the cellar, and their united force would suffice to
      raise the stone. So far I could follow their actions as if I had
      actually seen them.
