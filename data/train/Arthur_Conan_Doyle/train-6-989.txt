Already the moment of danger was passed. The French line had given back.
Those who had pierced the hedge had fallen like brave men amid the
ranks of their foemen. The division of Warwick had hurried up from the
vineyards to fill the gaps of Salisbury's battle-line. Back rolled the
shining tide, slowly at first, even as it had advanced, but quicker
now as the bolder fell and the weaker shredded out and shuffled with
ungainly speed for a place of safety. Again there was a rush from behind
the hedge. Again there was a reaping of that strange crop of bearded
arrows which grew so thick upon the ground, and again the wounded
prisoners were seized and dragged in brutal haste to the rear. Then the
line was restored, and the English, weary, panting and shaken, awaited
the next attack.
