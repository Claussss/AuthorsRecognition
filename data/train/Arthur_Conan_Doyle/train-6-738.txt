my horse, though indeed my head still rings like a cracked bell.” Nigel had lost all traces of his comrades; but he remembered Sir
Robert's words that he should ride upon the sun with the certainty that
sooner or later he would strike upon the road. As they jogged slowly
along over undulating hills, the Frenchman shook off his hurt and the
two chatted merrily together.
