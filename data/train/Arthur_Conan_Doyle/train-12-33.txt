“Tut! Tut!” said old McIntyre. “How is this, Laura? I knew nothing of
this. What do women know of money or of business? Hand the note over to
me and I shall relieve you of all responsibility. I will take everything
upon myself.” “I cannot possibly, papa,” said Laura, with decision. “I should not
think of parting with it.” “What is the world coming to?” cried the old man, with his thin hands
held up in protest. “You grow more undutiful every day, Laura. This
money would be of use to me--of use, you understand. It may be the
corner-stone of the vast business which I shall re-construct. I will use
it, Laura, and I will pay something--four, shall we say, or even
four and a-half--and you may have it back on any day. And I will give
security--the security of my--well, of my word of honour.”
