      is he still lurking out yonder?”       “I don’t know, sir. I hope to heaven that he has gone, for he has
      brought nothing but trouble here! I’ve not heard of him since I
      left out food for him last, and that was three days ago.”       “Did you see him then?”       “No, sir, but the food was gone when next I went that way.”
