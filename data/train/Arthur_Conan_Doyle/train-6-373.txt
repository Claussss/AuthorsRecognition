“Know you a little man, partly misshapen, named Paul de la Fosse?” “I know him well. He is a man of noble family and coat-armor, being the
younger brother of Sir Eustace de la Fosse of Shalford. Time was when I
had thought that I might call him son, for there was never a day that
he did not pass with my girls, but I fear that his crooked back sped him
ill in his wooing.” “Alas, Sir John! It is his mind that is more crooked than his back. He
is a perilous man with women, for the Devil hath given him such a tongue
and such an eye that he charms them even as the basilisk. Marriage may
be in their mind, but never in his, so that I could count a dozen and
more whom he has led to their undoing. It is his pride and his boast
over the whole countryside.”
