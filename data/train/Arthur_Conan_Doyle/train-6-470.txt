And now the long ride drew to an end. In front of them was the blue sea,
flecked with the white sails of ships. Once more the road passed upward
from the heavy-wooded plain to the springy turf of the chalk downs. Far
to the right rose the grim fortalice of Pevensey, squat and powerful,
like one great block of rugged stone, the parapet twinkling with steel
caps and crowned by the royal banner of England. A flat expanse of
reeded marshland lay before them, out of which rose a single wooded
hill, crowned with towers, with a bristle of masts rising out of the
green plain some distance to the south of it. Nigel looked at it with
his hand shading his eyes, and then urged Pommers to a trot. The town
was Winchelsea, and there amid that cluster of houses on the hill the
gallant Chandos must be awaiting him.
