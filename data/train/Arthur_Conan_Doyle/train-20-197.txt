      “It is a privilege to be associated with you in the handling of a
      case,” said the inspector, warmly. “You will excuse me, however,
      if I speak frankly to you. You are only answerable to yourself,
      but I have to answer to my superiors. If this Abe Slaney, living
      at Elrige’s, is indeed the murderer, and if he has made his
      escape while I am seated here, I should certainly get into
      serious trouble.”
