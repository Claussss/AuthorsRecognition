_Jan. 17._--For three nights I have had no experiences--my day of rest
has borne fruit. Only a quarter of my task is left, but I must make a
forced march, for the lawyers are clamouring for their material. I will
give them enough and to spare. I have him fast on a hundred counts. When
they realise what a slippery, cunning rascal he is, I should gain some
credit from the case. False trading accounts, false balance-sheets,
dividends drawn from capital, losses written down as profits,
suppression of working expenses, manipulation of petty cash--it is a
fine record!
