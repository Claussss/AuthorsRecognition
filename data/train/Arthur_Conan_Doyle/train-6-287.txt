earnestness unusual in his orisons. It was caused by the sudden outcry
of one of the Squires who, having lifted the helmet from the ground,
cast it down again with a scream of horror. “It is empty!” he cried. “It weighs as light as a feather.” “'Fore God, it is true!” cried Manny, laying his hand on it. “There
is no one in it. With what have I fought, father Bishop? Is it of this
world or of the next?”
