On either side innumerable huge Leyden jars stood ranged in rows, tier
topping tier, while above them were columns of Voltaic cells. Robert's

wire, stands, test-tubes, coloured bottles, graduated glasses, Bunsen
burners, porcelain insulators, and all the varied _debris_ of a chemical
and electrical workshop.
