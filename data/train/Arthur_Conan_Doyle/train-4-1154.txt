‘Mutinous, obstinate dog!’ cried the captain. ‘What ails you then? Why
have you a face like an underwriter in a tempest?’ ‘If it plaize you, zur,’ the prisoner answered, ‘Oi do but think o’ m’
ould mother at Wellington, and woonder who will kape her now that Oi’m
gone!’ ‘And what is that to me?’ shouted the brutal seaman. ‘How can you arrive
at your journey’s end sound and hearty if you sit like a sick fowl upon
a perch? Laugh, man, and be merry, or I will give you something to weep
for. Out on you, you chicken-hearted swab, to sulk and fret like a babe
new weaned! Have you not all that heart could desire? Give him a touch
with the rope’s-end, Jem, if ever you do observe him fretting. It is but
to spite us that he doth it.’
