It was covered with vessels. On all sides they lay thick upon its
surface. They were huge caracks, high-ended and portly, with red sides
and bulwarks carved and crusted with gold. Each had one great sail set
and was driving down channel on the same course at the Basilisk. Their
decks were thick with men, and from their high poops came the weird
clashing which filled the air. For one moment they lay there, this
wondrous fleet, surging slowly forward, framed in gray vapor. The next
the clouds closed in and they had vanished from view. There was a long
hush, and then a buzz of excited voices.
