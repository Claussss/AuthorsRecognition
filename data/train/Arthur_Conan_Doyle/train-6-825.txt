At the same instant two fellows clad in black, who had been seated with
a flagon of wine between them at a table near the fire, sprang wildly
to their feet, staring with blank amazement at this sudden inrush. That
instant of delay deprived them of their last chance of safety. Midway
down the room was a flight of stone steps which led to the main door. Swift as a wildcat Nigel bounded toward it and gained the steps a stride
or two before the jailers. They turned and made for the other which led
to the passage, but Simon and his comrades were nearer to it than they.
Two sweeping blows, two dagger thrusts into writhing figures, and the
ruffians who worked the will of the Butcher lay dead upon the floor of
their slaughter-house.
