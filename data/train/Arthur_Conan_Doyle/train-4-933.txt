‘They do indeed seem to be hot for battle,’ said Monmouth, with a more
sprightly look. ‘It may be that one who has commanded regular troops, as
I have done, is prone to lay too much weight upon the difference which
discipline and training make. These brave lads seem high of heart. What
think you of the enemy’s dispositions, Colonel Saxon?’ ‘By my faith, I think very little of them, your Majesty,’ Saxon answered
bluntly. ‘I have seen armies drawn up in array in many different parts
of the world and under many commanders. I have likewise read the section
which treats of the matter in the “De re militari” of Petrinus Bellus,
and in the works of a Fleming of repute, yet I have neither seen nor
heard anything which can commend the arrangements which we see before
us.’
