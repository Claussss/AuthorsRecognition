This should end the whole wretched business--this and the sack of the
city. I hope Pollock won't be squeamish, or truckle to the hysterical
party at home. The towns should be laid in ashes and the fields sown
with salt. Above all, the Residency and the Palace must come down. So
shall Burnes, McNaghten, and many another gallant fellow know that his
countrymen could avenge if they could not save him!
