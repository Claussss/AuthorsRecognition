      I stood for a minute or two to collect myself, for I was dazed
      with the horror of the thing. Then I began to think of Holmesâ€™s
      own methods and to try to practise them in reading this tragedy.
      It was, alas, only too easy to do. During our conversation we had
      not gone to the end of the path, and the Alpine-stock marked the
      place where we had stood. The blackish soil is kept forever soft
      by the incessant drift of spray, and a bird would leave its tread
      upon it. Two lines of footmarks were clearly marked along the
      farther end of the path, both leading away from me. There were
      none returning. A few yards from the end the soil was all
      ploughed up into a patch of mud, and the branches and ferns which
      fringed the chasm were torn and bedraggled. I lay upon my face
      and peered over with the spray spouting up all around me. It had
      darkened since I left, and now I could only see here and there
      the glistening of moisture upon the black walls, and far away
      down at the end of the shaft the gleam of the broken water. I
      shouted; but only the same half-human cry of the fall was borne
      back to my ears.
