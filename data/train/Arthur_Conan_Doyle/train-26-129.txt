This second line consists, as you see, of novelists of the
eighteenth century, or those of them whom I regard as essential.
After all, putting aside single books, such as Sterne's "Tristram
Shandy," Goldsmith's "Vicar of Wakefield," and Miss Burney's
"Evelina," there are only three authors who count, and they in turn
wrote only three books each, of first-rate importance, so that by
the mastery of nine books one might claim to have a fairly broad
view of this most important and distinctive branch of English
literature. The three men are, of course, Fielding, Richardson, and
Smollett. The books are: Richardson's "Clarissa Harlowe," "Pamela,"
and "Sir Charles Grandison"; Fielding's "Tom Jones", "Joseph
Andrews," and "Amelia"; Smollett's "Peregrine Pickle," "Humphrey
Clinker," and "Roderick Random." There we have the real work of
the three great contemporaries who illuminated the middle of
the eighteenth century--only nine volumes in all. Let us walk
round these nine volumes, therefore, and see whether we cannot
discriminate and throw a little light, after this interval of a
hundred and fifty years, upon their comparative aims, and how far
they have justified them by the permanent value of their work. A fat
little bookseller in the City, a rakehell wit of noble blood, and
a rugged Scotch surgeon from the navy--those are the three strange
immortals who now challenge a comparison--the three men who dominate
the fiction of their century, and to whom we owe it that the life
and the types of that century are familiar to us, their fifth
generation.
