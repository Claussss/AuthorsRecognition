off with their heads for the north, and the streak of sand upon their
left. “What is it?” asked Belmont, who found the dragoman riding at his elbow.
“Why are we going out of our course?” “Drift sand,” Mansoor answered. “Every sometimes the wind bring it all
in one long place like that. To-morrow, if a wind comes, perhaps there
will not be one grain left, but all will be carried up into the air
again. An Arab will sometimes have to go fifty or a hundred miles to go
round a drift. Suppose he tries to cross, his camel breaks its legs, and
he himself is sucked in and swallowed.”
