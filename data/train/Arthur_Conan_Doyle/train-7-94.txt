Belmont thrust in his cartridge and altered the sights. “It's a shocking
bad light for judging distance,” said he. “This is where the low
point-blank trajectory of the Lee-Metford comes in useful. Well, we'll
try him at five hundred.” He fired, but there was no change in the white
camel or the peering rider. “Did you see any sand fly?” “No; I saw nothing.” “I fancy I took my sight a trifle too full.” “Try
him again.” Man and rifle and rock were equally steady, but again the
camel and chief remained unharmed. The third shot must have been
nearer, for he moved a _few_ paces to the right, as if he were becoming
restless.
