indeed if Frenchmen could not be found to clear a path for the army of
the King of France. One would think to hear you talk, my Lord Count,

Rocamadour you will learn before nightfall that it is not so. It is for
me, who am a Marshal of France; to lead these three hundred, since it is
an honorable venture.”
