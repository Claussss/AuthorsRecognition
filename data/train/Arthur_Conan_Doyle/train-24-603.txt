“What! do you still pursue the quarrel?” asked Tranter. “And why not, sir? I am slow to take up such things, but once afoot I
shall follow it while I have life or breath.” “Ma foi! you have not too much of either, for you are as white as
marble,” said Harcomb bluntly. “Take my rede, sir, and let it drop, for
you have come very well out from it.” “Nay,” said Alleyne, “this quarrel is none of my making; but, now that I
am here, I swear to you that I shall never leave this spot until I have
that which I have come for: so ask my pardon, sir, or choose another
glaive and to it again.”
