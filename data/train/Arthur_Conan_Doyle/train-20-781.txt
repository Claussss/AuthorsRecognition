      “No doubt that is true, and yet they drank some wine, I
      understand.”       “To steady their nerves.”       “Exactly. These three glasses upon the sideboard have been
      untouched, I suppose?”       “Yes, and the bottle stands as they left it.”       “Let us look at it. Halloa, halloa! What is this?”       The three glasses were grouped together, all of them tinged with
      wine, and one of them containing some dregs of beeswing. The
      bottle stood near them, two-thirds full, and beside it lay a
      long, deeply stained cork. Its appearance and the dust upon the
      bottle showed that it was no common vintage which the murderers
      had enjoyed.
