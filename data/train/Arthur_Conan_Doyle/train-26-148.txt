Among the minor excellences of "Richard Feverel"--excuse the
prolixity of an enthusiast--are the scattered aphorisms which are
worthy of a place among our British proverbs. What could be more
exquisite than this, "Who rises from prayer a better man his prayer
is answered"; or this, "Expediency is man's wisdom. Doing right is
God's"; or, "All great thoughts come from the heart"? Good are the
words "The coward amongst us is he who sneers at the failings of
humanity," and a healthy optimism rings in the phrase "There is for
the mind but one grasp of happiness; from that uppermost pinnacle
of wisdom whence we see that this world is well designed." In more
playful mood is "Woman is the last thing which will be civilized by
man." Let us hurry away abruptly, for he who starts quotation from
"Richard Feverel" is lost.
