Walking slowly and on tiptoe, I picked my way through the weed-grown
garden, and peered through the open doorway. There was no furniture in the dreary interior, nor anything to cover the
uneven floor save a litter of fresh straw in a corner. Among this straw two men were crouching, the one small and wizened, the
other large-boned and gaunt, with their legs crossed in Oriental fashion
and their heads sunk upon their breasts. Neither of them looked up, or
took the smallest notice of our presence.
