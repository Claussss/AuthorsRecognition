And yet, on the whole, my balance inclines towards Richardson,
though I dare say I am one in a hundred in thinking so. First of
all, beyond anything I may have already urged, he had the supreme
credit of having been the first. Surely the originator should have
a higher place than the imitator, even if in imitating he should
also improve and amplify. It is Richardson and not Fielding who is
the father of the English novel, the man who first saw that without
romantic gallantry, and without bizarre imaginings, enthralling
stories may be made from everyday life, told in everyday language.
This was his great new departure. So entirely was Fielding his
imitator, or rather perhaps his parodist, that with supreme audacity
(some would say brazen impudence) he used poor Richardson's own
characters, taken from "Pamela," in his own first novel, "Joseph
Andrews," and used them too for the unkind purpose of ridiculing
them. As a matter of literary ethics, it is as if Thackeray wrote
a novel bringing in Pickwick and Sam Weller in order to show what
faulty characters these were. It is no wonder that even the gentle
little printer grew wroth, and alluded to his rival as a somewhat
unscrupulous man.
