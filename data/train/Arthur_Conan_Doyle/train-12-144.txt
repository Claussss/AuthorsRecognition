Robert heaved a long sigh of relief. “Perhaps you take too grave a view
of your responsibilities,” he said. “Everybody knows that the good which
you have done is immense. What more could you desire? If you really
wished to extend your benevolence further, there are organised charities
everywhere which would be very glad of your help.” “I have the names of two hundred and seventy of them,” Haw answered.
“You must run your eye over them some time, and see if you can suggest
any others. I send my annual mite to each of them. I don't think there
is much room for expansion in that direction.”
