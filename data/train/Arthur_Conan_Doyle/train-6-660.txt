“I was so, sire, when I had the fortune to see this battle as I passed.” The Prince laughed. “It would indeed be to ask too much, Robert, that
you should keep on your course when much honor was to be gathered so
close to you. But now I pray you that you will come back with us to
Winchelsea, for well I know that my father would fain thank you for what
you have done this day.” But Robert Knolles shook his head. “I have your father's command,
sire, and without his order I may not go against it. Our people are
hard-pressed in Brittany, and it is not for me to linger on the way. I
pray you, sire, if you must needs mention me to the King, to crave his
pardon that I should have broken my journey thus.”
