The outlaw sank his club. “The Socman's brother!” he gasped. “Now,
by the keys of Peter! I had rather that hand withered and tongue was
palsied ere I had struck or miscalled you. If you are the Socman's
brother you are one of the right side, I warrant, for all your clerkly
dress.” “His brother I am,” said Alleyne. “But if I were not, is that reason why
you should molest me on the king's ground?” “I give not the pip of an apple for king or for noble,” cried the serf
passionately. “Ill have I had from them, and ill I shall repay them. I
am a good friend to my friends, and, by the Virgin! an evil foeman to my
foes.”
