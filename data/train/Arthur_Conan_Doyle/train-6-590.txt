Of a sudden the King said something over his shoulder to Sir William de
Pakyngton the herald, who advanced and stood by the royal chair. He was
a tall and noble-featured man, with long grizzled beard which rippled
down to the gold-linked belt girdling his many-colored tabard. On his
head he had placed the heraldic barret-cap which bespoke his dignity,
and he slowly raised his white wand high in the air, while a great hush
fell upon the hall.
