At this moment there was a clatter of hoofs upon the road, and a varlet
by the door cried out that one of the Englishmen was coming back.
The champion looked wildly about for some corner of safety, and was
clambering up towards the window, when Ford's voice sounded from
without, calling upon Alleyne to hasten, or he might scarce find his
way. Bidding adieu to landlord and to champion, therefore, he set off at
a gallop, and soon overtook the two archers.
