“You may ask aught which it is becoming to me to answer. The bishop hath
need of a champion, because, if any cause be set to test of combat, it
would scarce become his office to go down into the lists with leather
and shield and cudgel to exchange blows with any varlet. He looks around
him then for some tried fighting man, some honest smiter who can give a
blow or take one. It is not for me to say how far he hath succeeded, but
it is sooth that he who thinks that he hath but to do with the Bishop of
Montaubon, finds himself face to face with Francois Poursuivant d'Amour
Pelligny.”
