â€œI'd just the one candle that was in my hand; but there was a good light
from the hall lamp through the open door. I put down the candle and
jumped for a hammer that I'd left on the mantel. At the same moment he
sprang at me. I saw the glint of a knife, and I lashed at him with the
hammer. I got him somewhere; for the knife tinkled down on the floor. He
dodged round the table as quick as an eel, and a moment later he'd got
his gun from under his coat. I heard him cock it; but I had got hold of
it before he could fire. I had it by the barrel, and we wrestled for it
all ends up for a minute or more. It was death to the man that lost his
grip.
