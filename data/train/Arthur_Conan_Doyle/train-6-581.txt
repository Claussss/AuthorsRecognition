Never had Nigel in his simple life at Tilford pictured a scene of such
pomp and wondrous luxury. The grim gray walls were covered from ceiling
to floor with priceless tapestry of Arras, where hart, hounds and
huntsmen circled the great hall with one long living image of the chase.
Over the principal table drooped a line of banners, and beneath them
rows of emblazoned shields upon the wall carried the arms of the high
noblemen who sat beneath. The red light of cressets and of torches
burned upon the badges of the great captains of England. The lions and
lilies shone over the high dorseret chair in the center, and the same
august device marked with the cadency label indicated the seat of the
Prince, while glowing to right and to left were the long lines of noble
insignia, honored in peace and terrible in war. There shone the gold
and sable of Manny, the engrailed cross of Suffolk, the red chevron of
Stafford, the scarlet and gold of Audley, the blue lion rampant of
the Percies, the silver swallows of Arundel, the red roebuck of the
Montacutes, the star of the de Veres, the silver scallops of Russell,
the purple lion of de Lacy, and the black crosses of Clinton.
