"Both legs?" "No, only one." "Suddenly?" "This morning." The doctor pouted his lips, and drew his finger and thumb down the line
of his chin.  "Can you account for it?" he asked briskly. A trace of sternness came into the large brown eyes. "I need not point out to you that unless the most absolute
frankness----" The patient sprang from his chair.  "So help me God!" he cried, "I have
nothing in my life with which to reproach myself.  Do you think that I
would be such a fool as to come here and tell you lies.  Once for all,
I have nothing to regret."  He was a pitiful, half-tragic and
half-grotesque figure, as he stood with one trouser leg rolled to the
knee, and that ever present horror still lurking in his eyes.  A burst
of merriment came from the card-players in the next room, and the two
looked at each other in silence.
