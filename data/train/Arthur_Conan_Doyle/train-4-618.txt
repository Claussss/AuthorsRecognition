The council rose at the King’s salutation, and bowing to him they began
to file out of the Castle hall. Several of the members clustered round
me with hints for my journey or suggestions as to my conduct. ‘He is a proud, froward man,’ said one. ‘Speak humbly to him or he will
never hearken to your message, but will order you to be scourged out of
his presence.’ ‘Nay, nay!’ cried another. ‘He is hot, but he loves a man that is a
man. Speak boldly and honestly to him, and he is more like to listen to
reason.’
