A sergeant and a constable stood in the doorway. Holmes drew his card
from his case. “This is my name and address. This is my friend, Dr. Watson.” “Bless you, sir, we know you very well,” said the sergeant, “but you
can’t stay here without a warrant.” “Of course not. I quite understand that.” “Arrest him!” cried Peters. “We know where to lay our hands on this gentleman if he is wanted,”
said the sergeant majestically, “but you’ll have to go, Mr. Holmes.”
