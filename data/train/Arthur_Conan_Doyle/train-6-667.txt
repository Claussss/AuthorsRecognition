Black Simon's dark face was shining with a fierce joy. “Fair sir, I will
ever be your debtor if you will let me go. Concerning what you ask, I
know this island even as I know the streets of Norwich, as you may well
believe seeing that it is but a small place and I upon it for near a
year. Should I land after dark, I could win my way to the King's house,
and if he be not dead or distraught with drink I could have speech with
him alone, for I know his ways and his hours and how he may be found. I
would ask only that Aylward the archer may go with me, that I may have
one friend at my side if things should chance to go awry.”
