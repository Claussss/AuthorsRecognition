For a moment it seemed as if the vessel was captured without a blow
being struck, for the men of the English ship had run wildly in all
directions to look for their arms. Scores of archers might be seen under
the shadow of the forecastle and the poop bending their bowstaves to
string them with the cords from their waterproof cases. Others were
scrambling over saddles, barrels and cases in wild search of their
quivers. Each as he came upon his arrows pulled out a few to lend to his
less fortunate comrades. In mad haste the men-at-arms also were feeling
and grasping in the dark corners, picking up steel caps which would not
fit them, hurling them down on the deck, and snatching eagerly at any
swords or spears that came their way.
