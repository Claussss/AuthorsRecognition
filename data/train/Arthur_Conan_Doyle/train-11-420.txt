They swayed back and forward; they no longer advanced; they were held.
Great Heaven! was it possible that they were breaking? One black dot ran
down the hill, then two, then four, then ten, then a great, scattered,
struggling mass, halting, breaking, halting, and at last shredding out
and rushing madly downward. “The Guard is beaten! The Guard is beaten!”
 From all around me I heard the cry. Along the whole line the infantry
turned their faces and the gunners flinched from their guns.
