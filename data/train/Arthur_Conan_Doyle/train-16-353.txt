"I see that you have heard of him," said the young baronet. "He died
horribly, I have been told, but not more horribly than he had lived. My
father was his only son. He was a studious, man, fond of books and
canaries and the country. But his innocent life did not save him." "His symptoms were cutaneous, I understand." "He wore gloves in the house. That was the first thing I can remember.
And then it was his throat, and then his legs. He used to ask me so
often about my own health, and I thought him so fussy, for how could I
tell what the meaning of it was? He was always watching me--always with
a sidelong eye fixed upon me. Now at last I know what he was watching
for."
