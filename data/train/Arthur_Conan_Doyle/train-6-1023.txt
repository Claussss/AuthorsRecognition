Tilford Bridge,” said he. “On my father's soul, I have ever said that
you would win your way. Did you receive the King's surrender?” “Nay, fair lord, I did not receive it.” “Did you hear him give it?” “I heard, sir, but I did not know that it was the King. My master Lord
Chandos had gone on, and I followed after.” “And left him lying. Then the surrender was not complete, and by the
laws of war the ransom goes to Denis de Morbecque, if his story be
true.”
