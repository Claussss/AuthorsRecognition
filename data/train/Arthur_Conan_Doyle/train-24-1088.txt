As to John, he took unto himself a village maid, and settled in
Lyndhurst, where his five thousand crowns made him the richest franklin
for many miles around. For many years he drank his ale every night at
the “Pied Merlin,” which was now kept by his friend Aylward, who had
wedded the good widow to whom he had committed his plunder. The strong
men and the bowmen of the country round used to drop in there of an
evening to wrestle a fall with John or to shoot a round with Aylward;
but, though a silver shilling was to be the prize of the victory, it has
never been reported that any man earned much money in that fashion.
So they lived, these men, in their own lusty, cheery fashion--rude and
rough, but honest, kindly and true. Let us thank God if we have outgrown
their vices. Let us pray to God that we may ever hold their virtues. The
sky may darken, and the clouds may gather, and again the day may come
when Britain may have sore need of her children, on whatever shore of
the sea they be found. Shall they not muster at her call?
