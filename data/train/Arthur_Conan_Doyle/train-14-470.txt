      The fog-bank lay like white wool against the window. Holmes held
      the lamp towards it.       “See,” said he. “No one could find his way into the Grimpen Mire
      tonight.”       She laughed and clapped her hands. Her eyes and teeth gleamed
      with fierce merriment.       “He may find his way in, but never out,” she cried. “How can he
      see the guiding wands tonight? We planted them together, he and
      I, to mark the pathway through the mire. Oh, if I could only have
      plucked them out today. Then indeed you would have had him at
      your mercy!”
