      “On entering the room their first proceeding must have been to
      gag Mr. Blessington. He may have been asleep, or he may have been
      so paralyzed with terror as to have been unable to cry out. These
      walls are thick, and it is conceivable that his shriek, if he had
      time to utter one, was unheard.       “Having secured him, it is evident to me that a consultation of
      some sort was held. Probably it was something in the nature of a
      judicial proceeding. It must have lasted for some time, for it
      was then that these cigars were smoked. The older man sat in that
      wicker chair; it was he who used the cigar-holder. The younger
      man sat over yonder; he knocked his ash off against the chest of
      drawers. The third fellow paced up and down. Blessington, I
      think, sat upright in the bed, but of that I cannot be absolutely
      certain.
