      “‘So, you’re one of those damned touts!’ cried the lad. ‘I’ll
      show you how we serve them in King’s Pyland.’ He sprang up and
      rushed across the stable to unloose the dog. The girl fled away
      to the house, but as she ran she looked back and saw that the
      stranger was leaning through the window. A minute later, however,
      when Hunter rushed out with the hound he was gone, and though he
      ran all round the buildings he failed to find any trace of him.”
