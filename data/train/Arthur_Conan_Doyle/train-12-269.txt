The girl started, and turned white to the lips. A long talk with Mr.
Spurling! Did that mean that he had learned her secret? “Well?” she gasped. “He tells me that my charity has done more harm than good, and in fact,
that I have had an evil influence upon every one whom I have come
near. He said it in the most delicate way, but that was really what it
amounted to.” “Oh, is that all?” said Laura, with a long sigh of relief. “You must not
think of minding what Mr. Spurling says. Why, it is absurd on the face
of it! Everybody knows that there are dozens of men all over the country
who would have been ruined and turned out of their houses if you had not
stood their friend. How could they be the worse for having known you? I
wonder that Mr. Spurling can talk such nonsense!”
