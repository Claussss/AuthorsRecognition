Very quiet was the wedding in the old priory church at Christchurch,
where Father Christopher read the service, and there were few to see
save the Lady Loring and John, and a dozen bowmen from the castle. The
Lady of Twynham had drooped and pined for weary months, so that her face
was harsher and less comely than before, yet she still hoped on, for her
lord had come through so many dangers that she could scarce believe that
he might be stricken down at last. It had been her wish to start for
Spain and to search for him, but Alleyne had persuaded her to let him
go in her place. There was much to look after, now that the lands of
Minstead were joined to those of Twynham, and Alleyne had promised her
that if she would but bide with his wife he would never come back to
Hampshire again until he had gained some news, good or ill, of her lord
and lover.
