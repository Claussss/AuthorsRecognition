‘Right gallantly done!’ I exclaimed. ‘But where have I heard your name
before, Mr. Hector Marot?’ ‘Nay,’ he answered, with a sharp, sidelong look, ‘I cannot tell that.’ ‘It is familiar to mine ear,’ said I. He shrugged his broad shoulders, and continued to look to the priming
of his pistols, with a half-defiant and half-uneasy expression. He was
a very sturdy, deep-chested man, with a stern, square-jawed face, and a
white seam across his bronzed forehead as from a slash with a knife. He
wore a gold-edged riding-cap, a jacket of brown sad-coloured stuff much
stained by the weather, a pair of high rusty jack-boots, and a small
bob-wig.
