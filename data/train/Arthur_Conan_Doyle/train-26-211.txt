The tradition of Arctic exploration is a noble one among Americans
as well as ourselves. The next book is a case in point. It is
Greely's "Arctic Service," and it is a worthy shelf-companion
to Scott's "Account of the Voyage of the Discovery." There are
incidents in this book which one can never forget. The episode of
those twenty-odd men lying upon that horrible bluff, and dying one
a day from cold and hunger and scurvy, is one which dwarfs all our
puny tragedies of romance. And the gallant starving leader giving
lectures on abstract science in an attempt to take the thoughts of
the dying men away from their sufferings--what a picture! It is bad
to suffer from cold and bad to suffer from hunger, and bad to live
in the dark; but that men could do all these things for six months
on end, and that some should live to tell the tale, is, indeed, a
marvel. What a world of feeling lies in the exclamation of the poor
dying lieutenant: "Well, this _is_ wretched," he groaned, as he
turned his face to the wall.
