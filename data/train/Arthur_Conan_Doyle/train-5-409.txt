"Eh! you're talking nonsense, Styles." "Maybe so, sir; but I heard it more'n once with my own ears." "Rubbish, Styles." "Very good, sir.  You'll ring the bell if you want me." Abercrombie Smith gave little heed to the gossip of the old
man-servant, but a small incident occurred a few days later which left
an unpleasant effect upon his mind, and brought the words of Styles
forcibly to his memory. Bellingham had come up to see him late one night, and was entertaining
him with an interesting account of the rock tombs of Beni Hassan in
Upper Egypt, when Smith, whose hearing was remarkably acute, distinctly
heard the sound of a door opening on the landing below.
