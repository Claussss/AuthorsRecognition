fair, by any reaver or outlaw that seeks a mark for his bow?” he cried.
“By Saint Paul! Aylward, I will put on my harness and go further into
the matter. Help me to untruss, I pray you!” “Nay, my fair lord, I will not help you to your own downfall. It is a
match with cogged dice betwixt a horseman on the moor and archers amid
the forest. But these men are no outlaws, or they would not dare to draw
their bows within a league of the sheriff of Guildford.”
