      He tore off a strip of the blotting-paper and turned towards us
      the following hieroglyphic:       hieroglyphic       Cyril Overton was much excited. “Hold it to the glass!” he cried.       “That is unnecessary,” said Holmes. “The paper is thin, and the
      reverse will give the message. Here it is.” He turned it over,
      and we read:       the reverse       “So that is the tail end of the telegram which Godfrey Staunton
      dispatched within a few hours of his disappearance. There are at
      least six words of the message which have escaped us; but what
      remains—‘Stand by us for God’s sake!’—proves that this young man
      saw a formidable danger which approached him, and from which
      someone else could protect him. ‘_Us_,’ mark you! Another person
      was involved. Who should it be but the pale-faced, bearded man,
      who seemed himself in so nervous a state? What, then, is the
      connection between Godfrey Staunton and the bearded man? And what
      is the third source from which each of them sought for help
      against pressing danger? Our inquiry has already narrowed down to
      that.”
