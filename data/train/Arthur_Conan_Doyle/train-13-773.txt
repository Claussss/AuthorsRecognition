      “What has he done, then?”       “His career has been an extraordinary one. He is a man of good
      birth and excellent education, endowed by nature with a
      phenomenal mathematical faculty. At the age of twenty-one he
      wrote a treatise upon the Binomial Theorem, which has had a
      European vogue. On the strength of it he won the Mathematical
      Chair at one of our smaller universities, and had, to all
      appearances, a most brilliant career before him. But the man had
      hereditary tendencies of the most diabolical kind. A criminal
      strain ran in his blood, which, instead of being modified, was
      increased and rendered infinitely more dangerous by his
      extraordinary mental powers. Dark rumours gathered round him in
      the university town, and eventually he was compelled to resign
      his chair and to come down to London, where he set up as an Army
      coach. So much is known to the world, but what I am telling you
      now is what I have myself discovered.
