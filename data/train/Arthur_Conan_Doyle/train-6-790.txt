The words rang in his weary brain. He had done what seemed right, come
what might. It had gone awry, it is true; but all things human may do
that. If he had carried the castle, he felt that Knolles would have
forgiven and forgotten all else. If he had not carried it, it was no
fault of his. No man could have done more. If Mary could see she would
surely have approved. Dropping into sleep, he saw her dark face, shining
with pride and with pity, stooping over him as he lay. She stretched out
her hand in his dream and touched him on the shoulder. He sprang up and
rubbed his eyes, for fact had woven itself into dream in the strange way
that it does, and some one was indeed leaning over him in the gloom, and
shaking him from his slumbers. But the gentle voice and soft touch of
the Lady Mary had changed suddenly to the harsh accents and rough grip
of Black Simon, the fierce Norfolk man-at-arms.
