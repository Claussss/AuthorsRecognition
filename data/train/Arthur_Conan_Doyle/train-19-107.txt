The fact is that my lectures had become the laughing-stock of the
university.  My class was crowded with students who came to see and
hear what the eccentric professor would do or say next.  I cannot go
into the detail of my humiliation.  Oh, that devilish woman!  There is
no depth of buffoonery and imbecility to which she has not forced me.
I would begin my lecture clearly and well, but always with the sense of
a coming eclipse.  Then as I felt the influence I would struggle
against it, striving with clenched hands and beads of sweat upon my
brow to get the better of it, while the students, hearing my incoherent
words and watching my contortions, would roar with laughter at the
antics of their professor.  And then, when she had once fairly mastered
me, out would come the most outrageous things--silly jokes, sentiments
as though I were proposing a toast, snatches of ballads, personal abuse
even against some member of my class.  And then in a moment my brain
would clear again, and my lecture would proceed decorously to the end.
No wonder that my conduct has been the talk of the colleges.  No wonder
that the University Senate has been compelled to take official notice
of such a scandal.  Oh, that devilish woman!
