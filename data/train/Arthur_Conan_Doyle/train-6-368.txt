Amid the richer classes there was rude profusion, great joints ever on
the sideboard, huge pies, beasts of the field and beasts of the chase,
with ale and rough French or Rhenish wines to wash them down. But the
very rich had attained to a high pitch of luxury in their food, and
cookery was a science in which the ornamentation of the dish was
almost as important as the dressing of the food. It was gilded, it was
silvered, it was painted, it was surrounded with flame. From the boar
and the peacock down to such strange food as the porpoise and the
hedgehog, every dish had its own setting and its own sauce, very strange
and very complex, with flavorings of dates, currants, cloves, vinegar,
sugar and honey, of cinnamon, ground ginger, sandalwood, saffron, brawn
and pines. It was the Norman tradition to eat in moderation, but to have
a great profusion of the best and of the most delicate from which to
choose. From them came this complex cookery, so unlike the rude and
often gluttonous simplicity of the old Teutonic stock.
