Yet it was there in that stream of death, in that reek of corruption,
that the brighter and freer England was born. There in that dark hour
the first streak of the new dawn was seen. For in no way save by a great
upheaval and change could the nation break away from that iron feudal
system which held her limbs. But now it was a new country which came out
from that year of death. The barons were dead in swaths. No high turret
nor cunning moat could keep out that black commoner who struck them
down.
