“Thank God!” he muttered. “It’s someone else.” “Ah, you’ve blundered badly for once, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said
Peters, who had followed us into the room. “Who is the dead woman?” “Well, if you really must know, she is an old nurse of my wife’s, Rose
Spender by name, whom we found in the Brixton Workhouse Infirmary. We
brought her round here, called in Dr. Horsom, of 13, Firbank
Villas—mind you take the address, Mr. Holmes—and had her carefully
tended, as Christian folk should. On the third day she died—certificate
says senile decay—but that’s only the doctor’s opinion, and of course
you know better. We ordered her funeral to be carried out by Stimson
and Co., of the Kennington Road, who will bury her at eight o’clock
to-morrow morning. Can you pick any hole in that, Mr. Holmes? You’ve
made a silly blunder, and you may as well own up to it. I’d give
something for a photograph of your gaping, staring face when you pulled
aside that lid expecting to see the Lady Frances Carfax and only found
a poor old woman of ninety.”
