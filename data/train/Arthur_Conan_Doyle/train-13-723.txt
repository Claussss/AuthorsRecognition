      “Ah!” cried Holmes.       “It sounds incredible, for I have not, as far as I know, an enemy
      in the world. Yet from last night’s experience I can come to no
      other conclusion.”       “Pray let me hear it.”       “You must know that last night was the very first night that I
      have ever slept without a nurse in the room. I was so much better
      that I thought I could dispense with one. I had a night-light
      burning, however. Well, about two in the morning I had sunk into
      a light sleep when I was suddenly aroused by a slight noise. It
      was like the sound which a mouse makes when it is gnawing a
      plank, and I lay listening to it for some time under the
      impression that it must come from that cause. Then it grew
      louder, and suddenly there came from the window a sharp metallic
      snick. I sat up in amazement. There could be no doubt what the
      sounds were now. The first ones had been caused by some one
      forcing an instrument through the slit between the sashes, and
      the second by the catch being pressed back.
