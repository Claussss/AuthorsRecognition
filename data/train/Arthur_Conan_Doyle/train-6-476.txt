“You are right, fair son. My grandfather can call to mind the time when
only the conies lived upon this rock. The town was down yonder by the
sea, until one night the waves rose upon it and not a house was left.
See, yonder is Rye, huddling also on a hill, the two towns like poor
sheep when the waters are out. But down there under the blue water and
below the Camber Sand lies the true Winchelsea--tower, cathedral, walls
and all, even as my grandfather knew it, when the first Edward was young
upon the throne.”
