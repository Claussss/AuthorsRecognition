“That will do,” cried Holmes. “What became of him?” “We’d enough to do without lookin’ after him,” the policeman said, in an
aggrieved voice. “I’ll wager he found his way home all right.” “How was he dressed?” “A brown overcoat.” “Had he a whip in his hand?” “A whip--no.” “He must have left it behind,” muttered my companion. “You didn’t happen
to see or hear a cab after that?” “There’s a half-sovereign for you,” my companion said, standing up and
taking his hat. “I am afraid, Rance, that you will never rise in the
force. That head of yours should be for use as well as ornament. You
might have gained your sergeant’s stripes last night. The man whom you
held in your hands is the man who holds the clue of this mystery, and
whom we are seeking. There is no use of arguing about it now; I tell you
that it is so. Come along, Doctor.”
