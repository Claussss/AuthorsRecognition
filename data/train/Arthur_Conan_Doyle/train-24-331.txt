He was brought back to himself, however, by a sudden little ripple of
quick feminine laughter. Aghast, he dropped the manuscript among the
chessmen and stared in bewilderment round the room. It was as empty and
as still as ever. Again he stretched his hand out to the romance, and
again came that roguish burst of merriment. He looked up at the ceiling,
back at the closed door, and round at the stiff folds of motionless
tapestry. Of a sudden, however, he caught a quick shimmer from the
corner of a high-backed bancal in front of him, and, shifting a pace
or two to the side, saw a white slender hand, which held a mirror of
polished silver in such a way that the concealed observer could see
without being seen. He stood irresolute, uncertain whether to advance or
to take no notice; but, even as he hesitated, the mirror was whipped
in, and a tall and stately young lady swept out from behind the oaken
screen, with a dancing light of mischief in her eyes. Alleyne started
with astonishment as he recognized the very maiden who had suffered
from his brother's violence in the forest. She no longer wore her gay
riding-dress, however, but was attired in a long sweeping robe of black
velvet of Bruges, with delicate tracery of white lace at neck and at
wrist, scarce to be seen against her ivory skin. Beautiful as she had
seemed to him before, the lithe charm of her figure and the proud, free
grace of her bearing were enhanced now by the rich simplicity of her
attire.
