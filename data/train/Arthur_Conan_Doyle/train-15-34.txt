"It is some sad comfort," said Magro, "to know that what Rome holds she
cannot keep." "Why say you that? When we go down, she is supreme in all the world." "For a time, and only for a time," Magro answered gravely. "Yet you will
smile, perchance, when I tell you how it is that I know it. There was a
wise woman who lived in that part of the Tin Islands which juts forth
into the sea, and from her lips I have heard many things, but not one
which has not come aright. Of the fall of our own country, and even of
this battle, from which we now return, she told me clearly. There is
much strange lore amongst these savage peoples in the west of the land
of Tin."
