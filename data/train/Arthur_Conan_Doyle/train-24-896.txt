“Who is there?” shouted a deep voice from below. “Who is this who speaks
with an English tongue?” “It is I, old lad. It is Sam Aylward of the Company; and here is your
captain, Sir Nigel Loring, and four others, all laid out to be grilled
like an Easterling's herrings.” “Curse me if I did not think that it was the style of speech of old
Samkin Aylward,” said the voice, amid a buzz from the ranks. “Wherever
there are knocks going there is Sammy in the heart of it. But who are
these ill-faced rogues who block the path? To your kennels, canaille!
What! you dare look us in the eyes? Out swords, lads, and give them the
flat of them! Waste not your shafts upon such runagate knaves.”
