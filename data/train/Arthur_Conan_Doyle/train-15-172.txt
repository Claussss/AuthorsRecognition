"They call him Cæsar." "It is surely Maximin the Thracian peasant." In the darkness the

than the first. If the one had been the roar of the oncoming wave, the

the camp had broken into one wild shout which echoed through the night,
until the distant Germans round their watch-fires listened in wonder and
alarm.
