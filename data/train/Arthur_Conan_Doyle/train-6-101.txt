So the old dame broke into a long poem, slow and dull in the inception,
but quickening as the interest grew, until with darting hands and
glowing face she poured forth the verses which told of the emptiness of
sordid life, the beauty of heroic death, the high sacredness of love and
the bondage of honor. Nigel, with set, still features and brooding eyes,
drank in the fiery words, until at last they died upon the old woman's
lips and she sank back weary in her chair.
