“So the shaft fly straight, I care not of the feather,” said the bowman,
a tall young Yorkshireman, counting out pennies on the palm of his horny
hand. “Gray goose-feathers are but a farthing. These on the left are a
halfpenny, for they are of the wild goose, and the second feather of a
fenny goose is worth more than the pinion of a tame one. These in the
brass tray are dropped feathers, and a dropped feather is better than
a plucked one. Buy a score of these, lad, and cut them saddle-backed or
swine-backed, the one for a dead shaft and the other for a smooth flyer,
and no man in the company will swing a better-fletched quiver over his
shoulder.”
