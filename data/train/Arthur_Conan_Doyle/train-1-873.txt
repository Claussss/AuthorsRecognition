Upon March 29th the untiring Plumer, called off from the chase of De
Wet, was loosed upon this fresh line, and broke swiftly away to the
north. The complete success of his undertaking has obscured our estimate
of its danger, but it was no light task to advance so great a distance
into a bitterly hostile country with a fighting force of 2000 rifles. As
an enterprise it was in many ways not unlike Mahon's dash on Mafeking,
but without any friendly force with which to join hands at the end.
However from the beginning all went well. On the 30th the force had
reached Warm Baths, where a great isolated hotel already marks the site
of what will be a rich and fashionable spa. On April 1st the Australian
scouts rode into Nylstroom, fifty more miles upon their way. There had
been sufficient sniping to enliven the journey, but nothing which could
be called an action. Gleaning up prisoners and refugees as they went,
with the railway engineers working like bees behind them, the force
still swept unchecked upon its way. On April 5th Piet Potgietersrust
was entered, another fifty-mile stage, and on the morning of the 8th
the British vanguard rode into Pietersburg. Kitchener's judgment and
Plumer's energy had met with their reward.
