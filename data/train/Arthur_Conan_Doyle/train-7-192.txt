With bows and suppliant sweepings of his hands the dragoman explained
that the Christians were already full of doubt, and that it needed but
a little more light of knowledge to guide them on to the path of Allah.
The two Emirs stroked their beards and gazed suspiciously at them. Then
Abderrahman spoke in his crisp, stern fashion to the dragoman, and the
two strode away together. An instant later the bugle rang out as a
signal to mount.
