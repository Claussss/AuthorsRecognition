A bow-shot from Pitt's Deep there was an inn a little back from the
road, very large and wide-spread, with a great green bush hung upon a
pole from one of the upper windows. At this window he marked, as he rode
up, that a man was seated who appeared to be craning his neck in his
direction. Alleyne was still looking up at him, when a woman came
rushing from the open door of the inn, and made as though she would
climb a tree, looking back the while with a laughing face. Wondering
what these doings might mean, Alleyne tied his horse to a tree, and
was walking amid the trunks towards the inn, when there shot from the
entrance a second woman who made also for the trees. Close at her heels
came a burly, brown-faced man, who leaned against the door-post and
laughed loudly with his hand to his side, “Ah, mes belles!” he cried,
“and is it thus you treat me? Ah, mes petites! I swear by these
finger-bones that I would not hurt a hair of your pretty heads; but I
have been among the black paynim, and, by my hilt! it does me good to
look at your English cheeks. Come, drink a stoup of muscadine with me,
mes anges, for my heart is warm to be among ye again.”
