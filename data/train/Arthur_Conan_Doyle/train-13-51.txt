      We had been walking briskly during this conversation, and a few
      more minutes brought us to the hollow in question. At Holmesâ€™
      request I walked down the bank to the right, and he to the left,
      but I had not taken fifty paces before I heard him give a shout,
      and saw him waving his hand to me. The track of a horse was
      plainly outlined in the soft earth in front of him, and the shoe
      which he took from his pocket exactly fitted the impression.
