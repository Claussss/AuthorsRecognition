“Sir Robert,” he said, “though you are young in years you are already
old in war, and I have heard that you are as prudent in council as you
are valiant in the field. To you I commit the charge of this venture to
Brittany in place of Sir John Chandos, who will follow thither when our
work has been done upon the waters. Three ships lie in Calais port and
three hundred men are ready to your hand. Sir John will tell you what
our mind is in the matter. And now, my friends and good comrades, you
will haste you each to his own quarters, and you will make swiftly such
preparations as are needful, for, as God is my aid, I will sail with you
to Winchelsea to-morrow!”
