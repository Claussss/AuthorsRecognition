      Sherlock Holmes preserved his calm professional manner until our
      visitor had left us, although it was easy for me, who knew him so
      well, to see that he was profoundly excited. The moment that
      Hilton Cubitt’s broad back had disappeared through the door my
      comrade rushed to the table, laid out all the slips of paper
      containing dancing men in front of him, and threw himself into an
      intricate and elaborate calculation. For two hours I watched him
      as he covered sheet after sheet of paper with figures and
      letters, so completely absorbed in his task that he had evidently
      forgotten my presence. Sometimes he was making progress and
      whistled and sang at his work; sometimes he was puzzled, and
      would sit for long spells with a furrowed brow and a vacant eye.
      Finally he sprang from his chair with a cry of satisfaction, and
      walked up and down the room rubbing his hands together. Then he
      wrote a long telegram upon a cable form. “If my answer to this is
      as I hope, you will have a very pretty case to add to your
      collection, Watson,” said he. “I expect that we shall be able to
      go down to Norfolk tomorrow, and to take our friend some very
      definite news as to the secret of his annoyance.”
