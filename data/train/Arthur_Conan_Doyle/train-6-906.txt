But all was vain! Beaumanoir's head reeled. His senses were leaving him.
In another minute he and his men would have been stretched senseless
before this terrible circle of steel, when suddenly the whole array
fell in pieces before his eyes, his enemies Croquart, Knolles, Calverly,
Belford, all were stretched upon the ground together, their weapons
dashed from their hands and their bodies too exhausted to rise. The
surviving Bretons had but strength to fall upon them dagger in hands,
and to wring from them their surrender with the sharp point stabbing
through their visors. Then victors and vanquished lay groaning and
panting in one helpless and blood-smeared heap.
