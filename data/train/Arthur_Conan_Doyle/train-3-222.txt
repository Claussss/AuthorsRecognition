Our post-bag is very full, and it takes Major Wood and myself all our
time to keep up with the letters. Many of them are so wonderful that I
wish I had preserved them all, but it would have meant adding another
trunk to our baggage. There are a few samples which have been rescued.
Many people seemed to think that I was myself a wandering medium, and I
got this sort of missive:      "DEAR SIR,--_I am very anxious to ask you a question, trusting you
     will answer me. What I wish to know I have been corresponding with
     a gentleman for nearly three years. From this letter can you tell
     me if I will marry him. I want you to answer this as I am keeping
     it strictly private and would dearly love you to answer this
     message if possible, and if I will do quite right if I marry him.
     Trusting to hear from you soon. Yours faithfully----._
