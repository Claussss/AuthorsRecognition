      “He wasn’t a tall, handsome, dark young man?”       “Oh, no, sir. He was a little gentleman, with glasses, thin in
      the face, but very pleasant in his ways, for he was laughing all

      as they are well aware from their experience the other night.
      This villain was able to terrorise him the instant that he got
      into his presence. No doubt they want his professional services,
      but, having used him, they may be inclined to punish him for what
      they will regard as his treachery.”
