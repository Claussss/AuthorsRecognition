The old dame flamed suddenly into white wrath as she stood before the
angry monk: “Listen to me while I lay a curse upon you and yours!”
 she cried as she raised her shriveled arms and blighted him with her
flashing eyes-- “As you have done to the house of Loring, so may God do to you, until
your power is swept from the land of England, and of your great Abbey
of Waverley there is nothing left but a pile of gray stones in a green
meadow! I see it! I see it! With my old eyes I see it! From scullion to
Abbot and from cellar to tower, may Waverley and all within it droop and
wither from this night on!”
