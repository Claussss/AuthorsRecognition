The squire, a dark, slender stripling, spoke firmly and quickly, as one
who was trained to swift action. “There is a passage under the earth
into the castle,” said he, “and through it some of the Jacks made their
way, casting open the gates for the others. They have had help from
within the walls, and the men-at-arms were heavy with wine: they must
have been slain in their beds, for these devils crept from room to room
with soft step and ready knife. Sir Amory the Hospitaller was struck
down with an axe as he rushed before us from his sleeping-chamber. Save
only ourselves, I do not think that there are any left alive.”
