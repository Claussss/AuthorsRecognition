“Sir,” said the knight, still kneeling with bowed head before his
leader, “I have a boon to ask of you.” “Nay, James, rise! Let me hear what I can do.” The famous knight errant, pattern of chivalry for all time; rose and
turned his swarthy face and dark earnest eyes upon his master. “Sir,”
 said he, “I have ever served most loyally my lord your father and
yourself, and shall continue so to do so long as I have life. Dear sir,
I must now acquaint you that formerly I made a vow if ever I should be
in any battle under your command that I would be foremost or die in the
attempt. I beg therefore that you will graciously permit me to honorably
quit my place among the others, that I may post myself in such wise as
to accomplish my vow.”
