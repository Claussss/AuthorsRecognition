      “I cannot recall the name.”       “Very likely not. There are many men in London, you know, who,
      some from shyness, some from misanthropy, have no wish for the
      company of their fellows. Yet they are not averse to comfortable
      chairs and the latest periodicals. It is for the convenience of

      permitted to take the least notice of any other one. Save in the
      Stranger’s Room, no talking is, under any circumstances, allowed,

      render the talker liable to expulsion. My brother was one of the
      founders, and I have myself found it a very soothing atmosphere.”
