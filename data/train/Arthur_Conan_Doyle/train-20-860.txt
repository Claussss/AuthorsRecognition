      “She was certainly much moved.”       “Remember also the curious earnestness with which she assured us
      that it was best for her husband that she should know all. What

      the woman at Margate whom I suspected for the same reason. No
      powder on her nose—that proved to be the correct solution. How
      can you build on such a quicksand? Their most trivial action may
      mean volumes, or their most extraordinary conduct may depend upon
      a hairpin or a curling tongs. Good-morning, Watson.”
