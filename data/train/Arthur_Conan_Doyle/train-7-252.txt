“As to the learning of which you speak, my lamb,” said the Moolah,
in answer to some argument of Fardet's, “I have myself studied at the
University of El Azhar at Cairo, and I know that to which you allude.
But the learning of the faithful is not as the learning of the
unbeliever, and it is not fitting that we pry too deeply into the ways
of Allah. Some stars have tails, O my sweet lamb, and some have not; but
what does it profit us to know which are which? For God made them all,
and they are very safe in His hands. Therefore, my friend, be not puffed
up by the foolish learning of the West, and understand that there is
only one wisdom, which consists in following the will of Allah as His
chosen prophet has laid it down for us in this book. And now, my lambs,
I see that you are ready to come into Islam, and it is time, for that
bugle tells that we are about to march, and it was the order of the
excellent Emir Abderrahman that your choice should be taken, one way or
the other, before ever we left the wells.”
