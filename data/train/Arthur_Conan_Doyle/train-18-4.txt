In the issue of the _Orientalisches Scienzblatt_ for January, 1861,
he is described as _“Der beruhmte und sehr gelhernte Hunter West von
Edinburgh”_--a passage which I well remember that he cut out and stowed
away, with a pardonable vanity, among the most revered family archives. He had been brought up to be a solicitor, or Writer to the Signet, as
it is termed in Scotland, but his learned hobby absorbed so much of his
time that he had little to devote to the pursuit of his profession.
