                                        _"Hindmarsh Square, Adelaide._      "_In Adelaide, on September 28th, I projected a lantern slide
     containing a group of ladies and gentlemen, and in the centre of
     the picture, when the slide was reversed, appeared a human face. On
     the appearance of the picture showing the group the fog incidental
     to a damp or new slide gradually appeared covering the whole slide,
     and only after some minutes cleared, and then quite contrary to
     usual practice did so from a central point just over the face that
     appeared in the centre, and refused even after that to clear right
     off to the edge. The general experience is for a slide to clear
     from the outside edges to a common centre. Your slide cleared only
     sufficiently in the centre to show the face, and did not, while the
     slide was on view, clear any more than sufficient to show that
     face. Thinking that perhaps there might be a scientific
     explanation to this phenomenon, I hesitated before writing you, and
     in the meantime I have made several experiments but have not in any
     one particular experiment obtained the same result. I am very much
     interested--as are hundreds of others who personally witnessed the
     phenomenon._"
