“Your words are very welcome, Thomas,” said the King, “and I make
no doubt that they will show themselves to be very worthy of what we
prepare for them. To you I give a ship, that you may have the handling
of it. You also, my dear son, shall have a ship, that evermore honor may
be thine.” “I thank you, my fair and sweet father,” said the Prince, with joy
flushing his handsome boyish face. “The leading ship shall be mine. But you shall have one, Walter Manny,
and you, Stafford, and you, Arundel, and you, Audley, and you, Sir
Thomas Holland, and you, Brocas, and you, Berkeley, and you, Reginald.
The rest shall be awarded at Winchelsea, whither we sail to-morrow. Nay,
John, why do you pluck so at my sleeve?”
