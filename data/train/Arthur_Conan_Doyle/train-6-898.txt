There was no answer to this and Knolles, weary and spent, returned to
his comrades. “I would that we had slain them,” said he. “We have lost
our leader and they have gained three men by the same stroke.” “If any more lay down their arms it is my order that you slay them
forthwith,” said Croquart, whose bent sword and bloody armor showed how
manfully he had borne himself in the fray. “And now, comrades, do not
be heavy-hearted because we have lost our leader. Indeed, his rhymes
of Merlin have availed him little. By the three kings of Almain! I can
teach you what is better than an old woman's prophecies, and that is
that you should keep your shoulders together and your shields so close
that none can break between them. Then you will know what is on either
side of you, and you can fix your eyes upon the front. Also, if any be
so weak or wounded that he must sink his hands his comrades on right and
left can bear him up. Now advance all together in God's name, for the
battle is still ours if we bear ourselves like men.”
