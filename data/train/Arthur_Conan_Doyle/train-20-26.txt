      “Do you know where we are?” he whispered.       “Surely that is Baker Street,” I answered, staring through the
      dim window.       “Exactly. We are in Camden House, which stands opposite to our
      own old quarters.”       “But why are we here?”       “Because it commands so excellent a view of that picturesque
      pile. Might I trouble you, my dear Watson, to draw a little
      nearer to the window, taking every precaution not to show
      yourself, and then to look up at our old rooms—the starting-point
      of so many of your little fairy-tales? We will see if my three
      years of absence have entirely taken away my power to surprise
      you.”
