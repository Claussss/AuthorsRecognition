And Stevenson? Surely he shall have two places also, for where
is a finer sense of what the short story can do? He wrote, in
my judgment, two masterpieces in his life, and each of them is
essentially a short story, though the one happened to be published
as a volume. The one is "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," which, whether
you take it as a vivid narrative or as a wonderfully deep and true
allegory, is a supremely fine bit of work. The other story of my
choice would be "The Pavilion on the Links"--the very model of
dramatic narrative. That story stamped itself so clearly on my brain
when I read it in Cornhill that when I came across it again many
years afterwards in volume form, I was able instantly to recognize
two small modifications of the text--each very much for the
worse--from the original form. They were small things, but they
seemed somehow like a chip on a perfect statue. Surely it is only a
very fine work, of art which could leave so definite an impression
as that. Of course, there are a dozen other of his stories which
would put the average writer's best work to shame, all with the
strange Stevenson glamour upon them, of which I may discourse later,
but only to those two would I be disposed to admit that complete
excellence which would pass them into such a team as this.
