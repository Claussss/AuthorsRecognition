“Indeed, Aylward, I think that you speak truth,” said Nigel. “It may
be that these are the men of Paul de la Fosse of Shalford, whom I
have given little cause to love me. Ah! there is indeed the very man
himself.” They sat their horses with their backs to the long slope which leads up
to the old chapel on the hill. In front of them was the dark ragged edge
of the wood, with a sharp twinkle of steel here and there in its shadows
which spoke of these lurking foes. But now there was a long moot upon
a horn, and at once a score of russet-clad bowmen ran forward from amid
the trees, spreading out into a scattered line and closing swiftly in
upon the travelers. In the midst of them, upon a great gray horse, sat a
small misshapen man, waving and cheering as one sets hounds on a badger,
turning his head this way and that as he whooped and pointed, urging his
bowmen onward up the slope.
