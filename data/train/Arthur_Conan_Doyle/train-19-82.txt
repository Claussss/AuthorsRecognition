As I looked up at her I was conscious of a change in her.  Her face,
which had been pale before, was now ghastly.  Her eyes were dull, and
the lids drooped heavily over them.  Above all, the look of serene
confidence had gone from her features.  Her mouth had weakened.  Her
forehead had puckered.  She was frightened and undecided.  And as I
watched the change my own spirit fluttered and struggled, trying hard
to tear itself from the grip which held it--a grip which, from moment
to moment, grew less secure.
