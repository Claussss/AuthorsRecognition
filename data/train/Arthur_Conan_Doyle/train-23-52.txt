It may be noted that the differences of opinion become most marked when
they deal with their own future, which may well be a matter of
speculation to them as to us.  Thus, upon the question of reincarnation
there is a distinct cleavage, and though I am myself of opinion that
the general evidence is against this oriental doctrine, it is none the
less an undeniable fact that it has been maintained by some messages
which appear in other ways to be authentic, and, therefore, it is
necessary to keep one's mind open on the subject.
