"My goodness, Smith, what's the matter?" asked Peterson, appearing at
the door of his study. "Give me some brandy!" Peterson disappeared, and came rushing out again with a glass and a
decanter. "You need it," he said, as his visitor drank off what he poured out for
him.  "Why, man, you are as white as a cheese." Smith laid down his glass, rose up, and took a deep breath. "I am my own man again now," said he.  "I was never so unmanned before.
But, with your leave, Peterson, I will sleep here to-night, for I don't
think I could face that road again except by daylight.  It's weak, I
know, but I can't help it."
