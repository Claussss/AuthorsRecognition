Nigel pointed to the boat which towed astern. “Let us venture forth
in her,” said he, “and let us take this ship or die worshipful in the
attempt.” His bold and fiery words found their echo in the brave rough hearts
around him. There was a deep-chested shout from both archers and seamen.
Even Aylward sat up, with a wan smile upon his green face. But Cock Badding shook his head. “I have never met the man who could
lead where I would not follow,” said he; “but by Saint Leonard! this is
a mad business, and I should be a fool if I were to risk my men and my
ship. Bethink you, little master, that the skiff can hold only five,
though you load her to the water's edge. If there is a man yonder,
there are fourteen, and you have to climb their side from the boat. What
chance would you have? Your boat stove and you in the water--there is
the end of it. No man of mine goes on such a fool's errand, and so I
swear!”
