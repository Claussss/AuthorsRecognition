      “Has she said anything yet?”       “No, Mr. Holmes, she has not. And yet there have been times when
      the poor girl has wanted to speak, and yet could not quite bring
      herself to take the plunge. I have tried to help her, but I
      daresay I did it clumsily, and scared her from it. She has spoken
      about my old family, and our reputation in the county, and our
      pride in our unsullied honour, and I always felt it was leading
      to the point, but somehow it turned off before we got there.”
