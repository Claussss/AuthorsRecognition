“He is a learned man,” Ram Singh remarked, after we had left him behind,
“but, like many another, he is intolerant towards opinions which differ
from his own. He will know better some day.” I made no answer to this observation, and we trudged along for a time in
silence, keeping well down to the water's edge, where the sands afforded
a good foothold. The sand dunes which lined the coast formed a continuous ridge upon our
left, cutting us off entirely from all human observation, while on the
right the broad Channel stretched away with hardly a sail to break its
silvery uniformity. The Buddhist priest and I were absolutely alone with
Nature.
