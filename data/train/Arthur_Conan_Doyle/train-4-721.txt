pick and shovel improving the defences. ‘Aye, they be busy sure enough, makin’ ready in case the rebels come
this road. Cromwell and his tawnies found it a rasper in my vather’s
time, and Monmouth is like to do the same.’ ‘It hath a strong garrison, too,’ said I, bethinking me of Saxon’s
advice at Salisbury. ‘I see two or three regiments out yonder on the
bare open space.’
