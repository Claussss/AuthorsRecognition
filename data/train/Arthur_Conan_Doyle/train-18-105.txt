“You misunderstand me,” the general answered. “It is on our side that
the disparity lies. There are reasons why my daughter Gabriel should
live and die single. It would not be to your advantage to marry her.” “But surely, sir,” I persisted, “I am the best judge of my own interests
and advantages. Since you take this ground all becomes easy, for I do
assure you that the one interest which overrides all others is that I
should have the woman I love for my wife. If this is your only objection
to our match you may surely give us your consent, for any danger or
trial which I may incur in marrying Gabriel will not weigh with me one
featherweight.”
