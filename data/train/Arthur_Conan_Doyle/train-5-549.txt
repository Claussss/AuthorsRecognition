"And a doctor has very much to be thankful for also.  Don't you ever
forget it.  It is such a pleasure to do a little good that a man should
pay for the privilege instead of being paid for it.  Still, of course,
he has his home to keep up and his wife and children to support.  But
his patients are his friends--or they should be so.  He goes from house
to house, and his step and his voice are loved and welcomed in each.
What could a man ask for more than that?  And besides, he is forced to
be a good man.  It is impossible for him to be anything else.  How can
a man spend his whole life in seeing suffering bravely borne and yet
remain a hard or a vicious man?  It is a noble, generous, kindly
profession, and you youngsters have got to see that it remains so."
