I went to Sadler and found him, to my surprise, in bed.  As I entered
he sat up and turned a face toward me which sickened me as I looked at
it. "Why, Sadler, what has happened?" I cried, but my heart turned cold as
I said it. "Gilroy," he answered, mumbling with his swollen lips, "I have for some
weeks been under the impression that you are a madman.  Now I know it,
and that you are a dangerous one as well.  If it were not that I am
unwilling to make a scandal in the college, you would now be in the
hands of the police."
