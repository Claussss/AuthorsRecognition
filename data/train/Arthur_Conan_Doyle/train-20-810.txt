      “I expect developments, Watson.”       “When?”       “Now—within a few minutes. I dare say you thought I acted rather
      badly to Stanley Hopkins just now?”       “I trust your judgment.”       “A very sensible reply, Watson. You must look at it this way:
      what I know is unofficial, what he knows is official. I have the
      right to private judgment, but he has none. He must disclose all,
      or he is a traitor to his service. In a doubtful case I would not
      put him in so painful a position, and so I reserve my information
      until my own mind is clear upon the matter.”
