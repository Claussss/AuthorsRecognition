Beckoning to Chandos, Manny and a few of his chosen leaders, the King
led them away to an inner chamber, where they might discuss the plans
for the future. At the same time the assembly broke up, the knights in
silence and dignity, the squires in mirth and noise, but all joyful at
heart for the thought of the great days which lay before them. 
XVII. THE SPANIARDS ON THE SEA 
Day had not yet dawned when Nigel was in the chamber of Chandos
preparing him for his departure and listening to the last cheery words
of advice and direction from his noble master. That same morning, before
the sun was half-way up the heaven, the King's great nef Philippa,
bearing within it the most of those present at his banquet the night
before, set its huge sail, adorned with the lions and the lilies, and
turned its brazen beak for England. Behind it went five smaller cogs
crammed with squires, archers and men-at-arms.
