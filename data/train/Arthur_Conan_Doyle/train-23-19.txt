As to his powers, they seem to have included every form of mediumship
in the highest degree--self-levitation, as witnessed by hundreds of
credible witnesses; the handling of fire, with the power of conferring
like immunity upon others; the movement without human touch of heavy
objects; the visible materialisation of spirits; miracles of healing;
and messages from the dead, such as that which converted the
hard-headed Scot, Robert Chambers, when Home repeated to him the actual
dying words of his young daughter.  All this came from a man of so
sweet a nature and of so charitable a disposition, that the union of
all qualities would seem almost to justify those who, to Home's great
embarrassment, were prepared to place him upon a pedestal above
humanity.
