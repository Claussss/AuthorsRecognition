To follow in close detail the movements of the Boers and the counter
movements of the British in the southeast portion of the Free State

patience of the reader. Let it be told with as much general truth and
as little geographical detail as possible. The narrative which is
interrupted by an eternal reference to the map is a narrative spoiled.
