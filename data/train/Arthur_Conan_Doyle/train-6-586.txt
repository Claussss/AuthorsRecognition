“Indeed the King hath some good tidings,” he continued. “See now, he
has whispered it to Chandos and to Manny. Manny spreads it on to Sir
Reginald Cobham, and he to Robert Knolles, each smiling like the Devil
over a friar.” “Which is Sir Robert Knolles?” asked Nigel with interest. “I have heard
much of him and his deeds.” “He is the tall hard-faced man in yellow silk, he with the hairless
cheeks and the split lip. He is little older than yourself, and his
father was a cobbler in Chester, yet he has already won the golden
spurs. See how he dabs his great hand in the dish and hands forth the
gobbets. He is more used to a camp-kettle than a silver plate. The big
man with the black beard is Sir Bartholomew Berghersh, whose brother is
the Abbot of Beaulieu. Haste, haste! for the boar's head is come and the
plate's to be cleaned.”
