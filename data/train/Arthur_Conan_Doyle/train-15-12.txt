An hour later the British deputation was ushered into the presence of
the Governor. They were good, steadfast men, men who with a whole heart,
and at some risk to themselves, had taken up their country's cause, so
far as they could see it. At the same time they well knew that under the
mild and beneficent rule of Rome it was only when they passed from words
to deeds that their backs or their necks would be in danger. They stood
now, earnest and a little abashed, before the throne of the viceroy.
Celticus was a swarthy, black-bearded little Iberian. Caradoc and Regnus
were tall middle-aged men of the fair flaxen British type. All three
were dressed in the draped yellow toga after the Latin fashion, instead
of in the brac√¶ and tunic which distinguished their more insular
fellow-countrymen.
