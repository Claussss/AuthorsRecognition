â€œI take credit to myself that I have kept my hands off the prussic-acid
or opium bottle. It has always been in my power to checkmate my occult
persecutors in that way, but I have ever held that a man in this world
cannot desert his post until he has been relieved in due course by the
authorities. I have had no scruples, however, about exposing myself to
danger, and, during the Sikh and Sepoy wars, I did all that a man could
do to court Death. He passed me by, however, and picked out many a young
fellow to whom life was only opening and who had everything to live for,
while I survived to win crosses and honours which had lost all relish
for me.
