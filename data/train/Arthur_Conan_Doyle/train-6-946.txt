XXV. HOW THE KING OF FRANCE HELD COUNSEL AT MAUPERTUIS 
The morning of Sunday, the nineteenth of September, in the year of our
Lord 1356, was cold and fine. A haze which rose from the marshy valley
of Muisson covered both camps and set the starving Englishmen shivering,
but it cleared slowly away as the sun rose. In the red silken pavilion
of the French King--the same which had been viewed by Nigel and Chandos
the evening before--a solemn mass was held by the Bishop of Chalons, who
prayed for those who were about to die, with little thought in his mind
that his own last hour was so near at hand. Then, when communion had
been taken by the King and his four young sons the altar was cleared
away, and a great red-covered table placed lengthwise down the tent,
round which John might assemble his council and determine how best he
should proceed. With the silken roof, rich tapestries of Arras round
the walls and Eastern rugs beneath the feet, his palace could furnish no
fairer chamber.
