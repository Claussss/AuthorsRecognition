      One day in early spring he had so far relaxed as to go for a walk
      with me in the Park, where the first faint shoots of green were
      breaking out upon the elms, and the sticky spear-heads of the
      chestnuts were just beginning to burst into their five-fold
      leaves. For two hours we rambled about together, in silence for
      the most part, as befits two men who know each other intimately.
      It was nearly five before we were back in Baker Street once more.
