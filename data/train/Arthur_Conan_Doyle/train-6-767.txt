There was a sudden flourish of a trumpet and the drawbridge fell. Across
it strode a portly man with a faded herald's coat. He halted warily upon
the farther side and his voice boomed like a drum. “I would speak with
your leader.” he cried. Knolles rode forward. “Have I your knightly word that I may advance unscathed with all
courteous entreaty as befits a herald?” Knolles nodded his head. The man came slowly and pompously forward. “I am the messenger and liege
servant,” said he, “of the high baron, Oliver de St. Yvon, Lord of La
Brohiniere. He bids me to say that if you continue your journey and
molest him no further he will engage upon his part to make no further
attack upon you. As to the men whom he holds, he will enroll them in his
own honorable service, for he has need of longbowmen, and has heard
much of their skill. But if you constrain him or cause him further
displeasure by remaining before his castle he hereby gives you warning
that he will hang these three men over his gateway and every morning
another three until all have been slain. This he has sworn upon the rood
of Calvary, and as he has said so he will do upon jeopardy of his soul.”
