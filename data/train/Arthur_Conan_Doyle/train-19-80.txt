Very vivid, however, is my recollection of how I met Miss Penclosa.
She was reclining on the sofa in the little boudoir in which our
experiments had usually been carried out.  Her head was rested on her
hand, and a tiger-skin rug had been partly drawn over her.  She looked
up expectantly as I entered, and, as the lamp-light fell upon her face,
I could see that she was very pale and thin, with dark hollows under
her eyes.  She smiled at me, and pointed to a stool beside her.  It was
with her left hand that she pointed, and I, running eagerly forward,
seized it,--I loathe myself as I think of it,--and pressed it
passionately to my lips.  Then, seating myself upon the stool, and
still retaining her hand, I gave her the photograph which I had brought
with me, and talked and talked and talked--of my love for her, of my
grief over her illness, of my joy at her recovery, of the misery it was
to me to be absent a single evening from her side.  She lay quietly
looking down at me with imperious eyes and her provocative smile.  Once
I remember that she passed her hand over my hair as one caresses a dog;
and it gave me pleasure--the caress.  I thrilled under it.  I was her
slave, body and soul, and for the moment I rejoiced in my slavery.
