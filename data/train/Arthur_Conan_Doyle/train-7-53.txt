“You look very happy,” said he. “Well, who could help feeling good with this dry, clear air, and the
blue sky and the crisp, yellow sand, and a superb donkey to carry you.

and cried for days and days at Smith's College, and the other girls were
just crazy to know what I was crying about, and guessing what the reason
was that I wouldn't tell, when all the time the real true reason was
that I didn't know myself. You know how it comes like a great dark
shadow over you, and you don't know why or wherefore, but you've just
got to settle down to it and be miserable.”
