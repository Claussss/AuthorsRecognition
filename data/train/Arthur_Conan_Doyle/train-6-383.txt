Meantime the Lady Mary upon the white jennet which her sister had ridden
on the same evening, Nigel on his war-horse, and the priest on the mule,
clattered down the rude winding road which led to London. The country on
either side was a wilderness of heather moors and of morasses from which
came the strange crying of night-fowl. A half-moon shone in the sky
between the rifts of hurrying clouds. The lady rode in silence, absorbed
in the thought of the task before them, the danger and the shame.
