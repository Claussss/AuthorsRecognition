“Go on, old babe of the woods!” “Have at it, Hampshire!” cried the
archers laughing. “By my soul! you may grin,” cried John. “But I learned how to make the
long shoot from old Hob Miller of Milford.” He took up a great black
bow, as he spoke, and sitting down upon the ground he placed his two
feet on either end of the stave. With an arrow fitted, he then pulled
the string towards him with both hands until the head of the shaft was
level with the wood. The great bow creaked and groaned and the cord
vibrated with the tension.
