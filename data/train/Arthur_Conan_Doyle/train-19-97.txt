I might have pitied this deformed woman--such a longing for love broke
suddenly through the menace of her eyes.  But then I thought of what I
had gone through, and my heart set like flint. "If ever you heard me speak of love," said I, "you know very well that
it was your voice which spoke, and not mine.  The only words of truth
which I have ever been able to say to you are those which you heard
when last we met."
