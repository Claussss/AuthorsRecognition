of this Professor Challenger?" "I never saw him till to-day." "Well, neither did I.  It's funny we should both sail under sealed

brothers of science don't seem too fond of him, either.  How came you
to take an interest in the affair?" I told him shortly my experiences of the morning, and he listened
intently.  Then he drew out a map of South America and laid it on the
table.
