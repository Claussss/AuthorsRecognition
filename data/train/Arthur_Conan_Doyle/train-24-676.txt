“I pray that my vase may join them,” said the prince. “But here is the
cavalier of Germany, and by my soul! he looks like a man of great valor
and hardiness. Let them run their full three courses, for the issue is
over-great to hang upon one.” As the prince spoke, amid a loud flourish of trumpets and the shouting
of the Gascon party, the last of the assailants rode gallantly into the
lists. He was a man of great size, clad in black armor without blazonry
or ornament of any kind, for all worldly display was forbidden by the
rules of the military brotherhood to which he belonged. No plume or
nobloy fluttered from his plain tilting salade, and even his lance was
devoid of the customary banderole. A white mantle fluttered behind him,
upon the left side of which was marked the broad black cross picked
out with silver which was the well-known badge of the Teutonic Order.
Mounted upon a horse as large, as black, and as forbidding as himself,
he cantered slowly forward, with none of those prancings and gambades
with which a cavalier was accustomed to show his command over his
charger. Gravely and sternly he inclined his head to the prince, and
took his place at the further end of the arena.
