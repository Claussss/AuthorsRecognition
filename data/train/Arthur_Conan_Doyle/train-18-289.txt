Happily there was no need of this extreme expedient, for I had not been
there half-an-hour before I heard the harsh sound of an opening lock,
and the general himself emerged from the main door. To my surprise he was dressed in a military uniform, and that not the
uniform in ordinary use in the British Army. The red coat was strangely
cut and stained with the weather. The trousers had originally been
white, but had now faded to a dirty yellow. With a red sash across his
chest and a straight sword hanging from his side, he stood the living
example of a bygone type--the John Company's officer of forty years ago.
