But if Napier's politics may seem strange, his soldiering was
splendid, and his prose among the very best that I know. There
are passages in that work--the one which describes the breach of
Badajos, that of the charge of the Fusiliers at Albuera, and that
of the French advance at Fuentes d'Onoro--which once read haunt the
mind for ever. The book is a worthy monument of a great national
epic. Alas! for the pregnant sentence with which it closes, "So
ended the great war, and with it all memory of the services of the
veterans." Was there ever a British war of which the same might not
have been written?
