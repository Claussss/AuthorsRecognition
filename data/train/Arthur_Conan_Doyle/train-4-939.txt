your advice, Colonel Buyse?’ ‘My advice is ever the same,’ the German answered. ‘We are here to
fight, and the sooner we get to work at it the better.’ ‘And yours, Colonel Saxon? Do you agree with the opinion of your

dispositions hath laid himself open to attack, and that we should take
advantage of it forthwith. Yet, considering that trained men and a
numerous horse have great advantage by daylight, I should be in favour
of a camisado or night onfall.’
