      Such were the singular circumstances in connection with the
      Resident Patient and the Brook Street Doctor. From that night
      nothing has been seen of the three murderers by the police, and
      it is surmised at Scotland Yard that they were among the
      passengers of the ill-fated steamer _Norah Creina_, which was
      lost some years ago with all hands upon the Portuguese coast,
      some leagues to the north of Oporto. The proceedings against the
      page broke down for want of evidence, and the Brook Street
      Mystery, as it was called, has never until now been fully dealt
      with in any public print.
