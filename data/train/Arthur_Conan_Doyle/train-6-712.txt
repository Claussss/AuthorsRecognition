He pointed to a live-oak by the roadside, and rode onward upon his way
in converse with his fellow-knights. But the old bowman had ridden after
him. “If it please you, Sir Robert, the bowmen would fain put these men to
death in their own fashion,” said he. “So that they die, I care not how,” Knolles answered carelessly, and
looked back no more. Human life was cheap in those stern days when the footmen of a stricken
army or the crew of a captured ship were slain without any question or
thought of mercy by the victors. War was a rude game with death for the
stake, and the forfeit was always claimed on the one side and paid on
the other without doubt or hesitation. Only the knight might be spared,
since his ransom made him worth more alive than dead. To men trained in
such a school, with death forever hanging over their own heads, it may
be well believed that the slaying of two peasant murderers was a small
matter.
