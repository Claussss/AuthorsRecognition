Crassus had interpreted this short dialogue. He now turned to the
Emperor. "If he is indeed to be always at your call, CÃ¦sar, it would be well to
give the poor Barbarian some name which your lips can frame. Theckla is
as uncouth and craggy a word as one of his native rocks." The Emperor pondered for a moment. "If I am to have the naming of him,"
said he, "then surely I shall call him Maximus, for there is not such a
giant upon earth."
