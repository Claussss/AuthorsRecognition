      “‘It was a long hour before we reached it, and at first we feared
      that we had come too late to save any one. A splintered boat and
      a number of crates and fragments of spars rising and falling on
      the waves showed us where the vessel had foundered; but there was
      no sign of life, and we had turned away in despair when we heard
      a cry for help, and saw at some distance a piece of wreckage with
      a man lying stretched across it. When we pulled him aboard the
      boat he proved to be a young seaman of the name of Hudson, who
      was so burned and exhausted that he could give us no account of
      what had happened until the following morning.
