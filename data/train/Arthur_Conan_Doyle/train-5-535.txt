"Walker was one of the best men in Europe on nervous disease.  You must
have read his little book on sclerosis of the posterior columns.  It's
as interesting as a novel, and epoch-making in its way.  He worked like
a horse, did Walker--huge consulting practice--hours a day in the
clinical wards--constant original investigations.  And then he enjoyed
himself also.  'De mortuis,' of course, but still it's an open secret
among all who knew him.  If he died at forty-five, he crammed eighty
years into it.  The marvel was that he could have held on so long at
the pace at which he was going.  But he took it beautifully when it
came.
