“It is a forgery!” gasped the Italian. “I pray you that you will let me see it, sire,” said Chandos. “De
Chargny was my prisoner, and so many letters passed ere his ransom was
paid that his script is well-known to me. Yes, yes, I will swear that
this is indeed his. If my salvation were at stake I could swear it.” “If it were indeed written by de Chargny it was to dishonor me,” cried
Sir Aymery. “Nay, nay!” said the young Prince. “We all know de Chargny and have
fought against him. Many faults he has, a boaster and a brawler, but a
braver man and one of greater heart and higher of enterprise does not
ride beneath the lilies of France. Such a man would never stoop to write
a letter for the sake of putting dishonor upon one of knightly rank. I,
for one, will never believe it.”
