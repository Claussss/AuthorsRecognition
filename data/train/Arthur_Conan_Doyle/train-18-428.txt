Our way lay for a couple of hundred yards along the high road, and then
passed through a gap in the hedge and on to the moor, across which we
were led in a bee-line to the northward. The sun had by this time risen above the horizon, and the whole
countryside looked so fresh and sweet, from the blue, sparkling sea to
the purple mountains, that it was difficult to realise how weird and
uncanny was the enterprise upon which we were engaged.
