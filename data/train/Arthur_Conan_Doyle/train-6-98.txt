         A sword!  A sword!  Ah, give me a sword!
           For the world is all to win.
         Though the way be hard and the door be barred,
           The strong man enters in.
         If Chance and Fate still hold the gate,
           Give me the iron key,
         And turret high my plume shall fly,
           Or you may weep for me!          A horse!  A horse!  Ah, give me a horse!
           To bear me out afar,
         Where blackest need and grimmest deed
           And sweetest perils are.
         Hold thou my ways from glutted days
           Where poisoned leisure lies,
         And point the path of tears and wrath
           Which mounts to high emprise!
