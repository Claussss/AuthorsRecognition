e sketch upon which he had been working, and
taking one of the lamps in his hand peered out into the darkness. The
long skeleton limbs of the bare trees tossed and quivered dimly amid the
whirling drift. His sister sat by the fire, her fancy-work in her lap,
and looked up at her brothers profile which showed against the brilliant
yellow light. It was a handsome face, young and fair and clear cut, with
wavy brown hair combed backwards and rippling down into that outward
curve at the ends which one associates with the artistic temperament.
There was refinement too in his slightly puckered eyes, his dainty
gold-rimmed _pince-nez_ glasses, and in the black velveteen coat which
caught the light so richly upon its shoulder. In his mouth only
there was something--a suspicion of coarseness, a possibility of
weakness--which in the eyes of some, and of his sister among them,
marred the grace and beauty of his features. Yet, as he was wont himself
to say, when one thinks that each poor mortal is heir to a legacy of
every evil trait or bodily taint of so vast a line of ancestors, lucky
indeed is the man who does not find that Nature has scored up some
long-owing family debt upon his features.
