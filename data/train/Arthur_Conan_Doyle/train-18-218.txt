I went up to my father's study to see if the old gentleman had any
instructions as to the estate, for he had become engrossed in a new work
upon Oriental literature, and the practical management of the property
had in consequence devolved entirely upon me. I found him seated at his square library table, which was so heaped with
books and papers that nothing of him was visible from the door except a
tuft of white hair.
