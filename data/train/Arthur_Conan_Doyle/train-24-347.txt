“It is for you also to bear the purse,” said the lady; “for my sweet
lord is of so free and gracious a temper that he would give it gayly to
the first who asked alms of him. All these things, with some knowledge
of venerie, and of the management of horse, hawk and hound, with the
grace and hardihood and courtesy which are proper to your age, will make
you a fit squire for Sir Nigel Loring.” “Alas! lady,” Alleyne answered, “I know well the great honor that you
have done me in deeming me worthy to wait upon so renowned a knight,
yet I am so conscious of my own weakness that I scarce dare incur duties
which I might be so ill-fitted to fulfil.”
