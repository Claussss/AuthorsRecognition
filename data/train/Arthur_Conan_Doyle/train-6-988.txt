A fearsome sight was Pommers that day, his red eyes rolling, his
nostrils gaping, his tawny mane tossing, and his savage teeth gnashing
in fury, as he tore and smashed and ground beneath his ramping hoofs
all that came before him. Fearsome too was the rider, ice-cool; alert,
concentrated of purpose, with, heart of fire and muscles of steel. A
very angel of battle he seemed as he drove his maddened horse through
the thickest of the press, but strive as he would: the tall figure of
his master upon his coal-black steed was ever half a length before him.
