      blue, all is well. If it turns red, it means a man’s life.” He
      dipped it into the test-tube and it flushed at once into a dull,
      dirty crimson. “Hum! I thought as much!” he cried. “I will be at
      your service in an instant, Watson. You will find tobacco in the
      Persian slipper.” He turned to his desk and scribbled off several
      telegrams, which were handed over to the page-boy. Then he threw
      himself down into the chair opposite, and drew up his knees until
      his fingers clasped round his long, thin shins.
