I wonder if by chance there was any other human eye but mine which
traced a connection between these paragraphs. I never showed them to
my wife or to Mordaunt, and they will only know of their existence when
they read these pages. I don't know that there is any other point which needs clearing up. The
intelligent reader will have already seen the reasons for the general's
fear of dark faces, of wandering men (not knowing how his pursuers might
come after him), and of visitors (from the same cause and because his
hateful bell was liable to sound at all times).
