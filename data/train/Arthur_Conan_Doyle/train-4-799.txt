which even the presence of the King could not keep in bounds; ‘how can

strange, nasal voice. ‘Did the Lard no breach the too’ers o’ Jericho
withoot the aid o’ gunpooder? Did the Lard no raise up the man Robert
Ferguson and presairve him through five-and-thairty indictments and
twa-and-twenty proclamations o’ the godless? What is there He canna do?
Hosannah! Hosannah!’
