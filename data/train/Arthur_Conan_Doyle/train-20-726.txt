      important than the treatise. Incidentally, I may tell you that we
      are doing the reverse of what you very justly blame, and that we

      private matters which must necessarily follow when once the case
      is fairly in the hands of the official police. You may look upon
      me simply as an irregular pioneer, who goes in front of the
      regular forces of the country. I have come to ask you about Mr.
      Godfrey Staunton.”
