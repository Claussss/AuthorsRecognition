In a solid line the English advanced, while the Bretons ran forward
as before to meet them. The swiftest of these was a certain Squire,
Geoffrey Poulart, who bore a helmet which was fashioned as a cock's
head, with high comb above, and long pointed beak in front pierced with
the breathing-holes. He thrust with his sword at Calverly, but Belford
who was the next in the line raised his giant club and struck him a
crushing blow from the side. He staggered, and then pushing forth from
the crowd, he ran round and round in circles as one whose brain is
stricken, the blood dripping from the holes of his brazen beak. So for
a long time he ran, the crowd laughing and cock-crowing at the sight,
until at last he stumbled and fell stone-dead upon his face. But the
fighters had seen nothing of his fate, for desperate and unceasing was
the rush of the Bretons and the steady advance of the English line.
