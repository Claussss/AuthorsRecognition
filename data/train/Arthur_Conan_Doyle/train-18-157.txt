As tae the young folks, I kenned weel that they didna bide in the
groonds, and that they were awa' whenever they got a chance wi' Maister
Fothergill West tae Branksome, but the general was too fu' o' his ain
troubles tae ken aboot it, and it didna seem tae me that it was pairt
o' my duties either as coachman or as gairdner tae mind the bairns.
He should have lairnt that if ye forbid a lassie and a laddie to dae
anything it's just the surest way o' bringin' it aboot. The Lord foond
that oot in the gairden o' Paradise, and there's no muckle change
between the folk in Eden and the folk in Wigtown.
