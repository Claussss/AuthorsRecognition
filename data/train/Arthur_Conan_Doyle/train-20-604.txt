      Holmes made no further allusion to the matter that day, though he
      sat lost in thought for a long time after our belated dinner. At
      eight in the morning, he came into my room just as I finished my
      toilet.       “Well, Watson,” said he, “it is time we went down to St. Luke’s.
      Can you do without breakfast?”       “Certainly.”       “Soames will be in a dreadful fidget until we are able to tell
      him something positive.”
