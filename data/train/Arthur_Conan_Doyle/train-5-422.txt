"Confound the chap!" cried Smith, as he shied his book on pathology
across the room.  "He has spoiled my night's reading, and that's reason
enough, if there were no other, why I should steer clear of him in the
future." For ten days the medical student confined himself so closely to his
studies that he neither saw nor heard anything of either of the men
beneath him.  At the hours when Bellingham had been accustomed to visit
him, he took care to sport his oak, and though he more than once heard
a knocking at his outer door, he resolutely refused to answer it.  One
afternoon, however, he was descending the stairs when, just as he was
passing it, Bellingham's door flew open, and young Monkhouse Lee came
out with his eyes sparkling and a dark flush of anger upon his olive
cheeks.  Close at his heels followed Bellingham, his fat, unhealthy
face all quivering with malignant passion.
