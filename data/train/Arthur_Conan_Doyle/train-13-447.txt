      like, for example, to see how far the windows of the bedrooms
      command the front. This, I understand is your son’s room”—he
      pushed open the door—“and that, I presume, is the dressing-room
      in which he sat smoking when the alarm was given. Where does the
      window of that look out to?” He stepped across the bedroom,
      pushed open the door, and glanced round the other chamber.
