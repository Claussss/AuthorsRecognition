“So will I also, Richard,” said Calverly. “And I too!” cried Belford. “But surely I hear music, and yonder are
their pennons amid the trees.” They all turned, leaning upon their short spears, and watched the
advance of the men of Josselin, as their troop wound its way out from
the woodlands. In front rode three heralds with tabards of the ermine of
Brittany, blowing loudly upon silver trumpets. Behind them a great man
upon a white horse bore the banner of Josselin which carries nine golden
torteaus upon a scarlet field. Then came the champions riding two
and two, fifteen knights and fifteen squires, each with his pennon
displayed. Behind them on a litter was borne an aged priest, the Bishop
of Rennes, carrying in his hands the viaticum and the holy oils that
he might give the last aid and comfort of the Church to those who were
dying. The procession was terminated by hundreds of men and women
from Josselin, Guegon, and Helleon, and by the entire garrison of the
fortress, who came, as the English had done, without their arms. The
head of this long column had reached the field before the rear were
clear of the wood, but as they arrived the champions picketed their
horses on the farther side, behind which their banner was planted and
the people lined up until they had inclosed the whole lists with a dense
wall of spectators.
