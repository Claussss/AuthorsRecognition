      “You must leave it as it is. I shall drop round early to-morrow
      morning and chat the matter over. It is possible that I may be in
      a position then to indicate some course of action. Meanwhile, you
      change nothing—nothing at all.”       “Very good, Mr. Holmes.”       “You can be perfectly easy in your mind. We shall certainly find
      some way out of your difficulties. I will take the black clay
      with me, also the pencil cuttings. Good-bye.”
