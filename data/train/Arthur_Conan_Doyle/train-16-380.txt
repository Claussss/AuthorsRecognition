"Oh, she's very much better," said Johnson, with enthusiasm. "Dear me, that's bad!" said the doctor. "Perhaps it will do if I look in
on my morning round?" "No, no," cried Johnson, clutching at his thick frieze overcoat. "We are
so glad that you have come. And, doctor, please come down soon and let
me know what you think about it." The doctor passed upstairs, his firm, heavy steps resounding through the
house. Johnson could hear his boots creaking as he walked about the
floor above him, and the sound was a consolation to him. It was crisp
and decided, the tread of a man who had plenty of self-confidence.
Presently, still straining his ears to catch what was going on, he heard
the scraping of a chair as it was drawn along the floor, and a moment
later he heard the door fly open, and some one came rushing downstairs.
Johnson sprang up with his hair bristling, thinking that some dreadful
thing had occurred, but it was only his mother-in-law, incoherent with
excitement and searching for scissors and some tape. She vanished again
and Jane passed up the stairs with a pile of newly-aired linen. Then,
after an interval of silence, Johnson heard the heavy, creaking tread
and the doctor came down into the parlour.
