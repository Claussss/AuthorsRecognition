"You're Norah Brewster, I s'pose," said Mrs. Simpson, eyeing her up and
down with no friendly gaze. "Yes, I've come to look after my Granduncle Gregory." "And a good job too," cried the housekeeper, with a toss of her head.
"It's about time that some of his own folk took a turn at it, for I've
had enough of it.  There you are, young woman!  In you go and make
yourself at home.  There's tea in the caddy and bacon on the dresser,
and the old man will be about you if you don't fetch him his breakfast.
I'll send for my things in the evenin'."  With a nod she strolled off
with her attendant gossips in the direction of the public house.
