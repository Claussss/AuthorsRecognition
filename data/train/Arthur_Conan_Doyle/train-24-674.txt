“They are to tilt singly not less than three courses, sire, and the
victory to rest with that party which shall have won the greater number
of courses, each pair continuing till one or other have the vantage. He
who carries himself best of the victors hath the prize, and he who is
judged best of the other party hath a jewelled clasp. Shall I order that
the nakirs sound, sire?” The prince nodded, and the trumpets rang out, while the champions rode
forth one after the other, each meeting his opponent in the centre of
the lists. Sir William Beauchamp went down before the practiced lance
of the Captal de Buch. Sir Thomas Percy won the vantage over the Lord
of Mucident, and the Lord Audley struck Sir Perducas d'Albret from
the saddle. The burly De Clisson, however, restored the hopes of the
attackers by beating to the ground Sir Thomas Wake of Yorkshire. So far,
there was little to choose betwixt challengers and challenged.
