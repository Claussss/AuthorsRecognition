“Faith, I'd be slow to do that,” said McMurdo. He held out his hand to
Baldwin. “I'm quick to quarrel and quick to forgive. It's my hot Irish
blood, they tell me. But it's over for me, and I bear no grudge.” Baldwin had to take the proffered hand; for the baleful eye of the
terrible Boss was upon him. But his sullen face showed how little the
words of the other had moved him. McGinty clapped them both on the shoulders. “Tut! These girls! These
girls!” he cried. “To think that the same petticoats should come between
two of my boys! It's the devil's own luck! Well, it's the colleen inside
of them that must settle the question; for it's outside the jurisdiction
of a Bodymaster--and the Lord be praised for that! We have enough on us,
without the women as well. You'll have to be affiliated to Lodge 341,
Brother McMurdo. We have our own ways and methods, different from
Chicago. Saturday night is our meeting, and if you come then, we'll make
you free forever of the Vermissa Valley.”
