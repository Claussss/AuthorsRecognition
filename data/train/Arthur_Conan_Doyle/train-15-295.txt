mother, with her grey hair down her back. I remember how she shrieked
when one of our fellows with his lance put Him out of his pain. And a
few others, women and men, poor and ragged, stood by Him. But, you see,
it has turned out as I thought. Even in Rome, as you have observed, His
followers have appeared."
