So this was what she meant by another turn of the screw!  She had made
a public imbecile of me.  Now she would brand me as a criminal.  This
time she has failed.  But how about the next?  I dare not think of
it--and of Agatha and my poor old mother!  I wish that I were dead! Yes, this is the other turn of the screw.  And this is also what she
meant, no doubt, when she said that I had not realized yet the power
she has over me.  I look back at my account of my conversation with
her, and I see how she declared that with a slight exertion of her will
her subject would be conscious, and with a stronger one unconscious.
Last night I was unconscious.  I could have sworn that I slept soundly
in my bed without so much as a dream.  And yet those stains tell me
that I dressed, made my way out, attempted to open the bank windows,
and returned.  Was I observed?  Is it possible that some one saw me do
it and followed me home?  Ah, what a hell my life has become!  I have
no peace, no rest.  But my patience is nearing its end.
