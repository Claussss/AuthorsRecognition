It was not, however, until we came abreast of the Terada Pass, a gloomy
defile bounded by gigantic cliffs, that the Afridis began to show in
force, though they had ambushed themselves so cleverly that, had we not

the trap. As it was, the convoy halted, upon which the Hillmen, seeing
that they were observed, opened a heavy but ill-directed fire upon us.
