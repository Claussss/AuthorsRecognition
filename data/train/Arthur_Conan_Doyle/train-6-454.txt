They had left Boxhill and Headley Heath upon the left, and the towers of
Reigate were rising amid the trees in front of them, when they overtook
a large, cheery, red-faced man, with a forked beard, riding upon a good
horse and exchanging a nod or a merry word with all who passed him. With
him they rode nearly as far as Bletchingley, and Nigel laughed much to
hear him talk; but always under the raillery there was much earnestness
and much wisdom in all his words. He rode at his ease about the country,
he said, having sufficient money to keep him from want and to furnish
him for the road. He could speak all the three languages of England, the
north, the middle and the south, so that he was at home with the people
of every shire and could hear their troubles and their joys. In all
parts in town and in country there was unrest, he said; for the poor
folk were weary of their masters both of the Church and State, and soon
there would be such doings in England as had never been seen before.
