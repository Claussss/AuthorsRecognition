The bird had indeed, with the cunning of its race, flapped its way
through brushwood and bushes to the thicker woods beyond, so that
neither the hawk amid the cover nor its partner above nor the clamorous
beaters could harm it. The King laughed at the mischance and rode on.
Continually birds of various sorts were flushed, and each was pursued
by the appropriate hawk, the snipe by the tercel, the partridge by the
goshawk, even the lark by the little merlin. But the King soon tired of
this petty sport and went slowly on his way, still with the magnificent
silent attendant flapping above his head.
