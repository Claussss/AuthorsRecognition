And who else? If it be not an impertinence to mention a
contemporary, I should certainly have a brace from Rudyard Kipling.
His power, his compression, his dramatic sense, his way of glowing
suddenly into a vivid flame, all mark him as a great master. But
which are we to choose from that long and varied collection, many of
which have claims to the highest? Speaking from memory, I should say
that the stories of his which have impressed me most are "The Drums
of the Fore and Aft," "The Man who Would be King," "The Man who
Was," and "The Brushwood Boy." Perhaps, on the whole, it is the
first two which I should choose to add to my list of masterpieces.
