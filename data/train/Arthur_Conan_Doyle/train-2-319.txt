“To whom, and where?” “To Miss Marie Devine. There is nothing to show where the check was
drawn. It was cashed at the Crédit Lyonnais at Montpellier less than
three weeks ago. The sum was fifty pounds.” “And who is Miss Marie Devine?” “That also I have been able to discover. Miss Marie Devine was the maid
of Lady Frances Carfax. Why she should have paid her this check we have
not yet determined. I have no doubt, however, that your researches will
soon clear the matter up.”
