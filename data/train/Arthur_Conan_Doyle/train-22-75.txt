precious time? Couldn't we start out and scout the country before the
fellow gets away?” The sergeant considered for a moment. “There are no trains before six in the morning; so he can't get away
by rail. If he goes by road with his legs all dripping, it's odds that
someone will notice him. Anyhow, I can't leave here myself until I am
relieved. But I think none of you should go until we see more clearly
how we all stand.”
