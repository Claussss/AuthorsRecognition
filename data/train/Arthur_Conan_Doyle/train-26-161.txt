Portsmouth, Plymouth, and Sheerness in flames, with London either
levelled to the ground or ransomed at his own figure--that was a
more feasible programme. Then, with the united fleets of conquered
Europe at his back, enormous armies and an inexhaustible treasury,
swollen with the ransom of Britain, he could turn to that conquest
of America which would win back the old colonies of France and leave
him master of the world. If the worst happened and he had met his
Waterloo upon the South Downs, he would have done again what he
did in Egypt and once more in Russia: hurried back to France in a
swift vessel, and still had force enough to hold his own upon the
Continent. It would, no doubt, have been a big stake to lay upon
the table--150,000 of his best--but he could play again if he lost;
while, if he won, he cleared the board. A fine game--if little
Nelson had not stopped it, and with one blow fixed the edge of salt
water as the limit of Napoleon's power.
