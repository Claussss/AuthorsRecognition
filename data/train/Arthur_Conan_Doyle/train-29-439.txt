Sherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. “In that case
we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind-swept
market-place,” said he. “But pray tell me, before we go farther, who it
is that I have the pleasure of assisting.” The man hesitated for an instant. “My name is John Robinson,” he
answered with a sidelong glance. “No, no; the real name,” said Holmes sweetly. “It is always awkward
doing business with an alias.”
