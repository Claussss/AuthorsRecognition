But the black soldier had been staring with a disconsolate face out over
the desert, and he turned upon his heel with an oath. “There!” said he, sullenly. “You see what comes of all your foolish
talking! You have ruined our chances as well as your own!” Half a dozen mounted camel-men had appeared suddenly over the lip of the
bowl-shaped hollow, standing out hard and clear against the evening
sky, where the copper basin met its great blue lid. They were travelling
fast, and waved their rifles as they came. An instant later the bugle
sounded an alarm, and the camp was up with a buzz like an overturned
bee-hive. The Colonel ran back to his companions, and the black soldier
to his camel. Stephens looked relieved, and Belmont sulky, while
Monsieur Fardet raved, with his one uninjured hand in the air.
