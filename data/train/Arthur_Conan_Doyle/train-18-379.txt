October 4.--The Hillmen really mean business this time, I think. We have
had two of our spies come in this morning with the same account about
the gathering in the Terada quarter. That old rascal Zemaun is at the
head of it, and I had recommended the Government to present him with
a telescope in return for his neutrality! There will be no Zemaun to
present it to if I can but lay hands upon him. We expect the convoy tomorrow morning, and need anticipate no attack
until it comes up, for these fellows fight for plunder, not for glory,
though, to do them justice, they have plenty of pluck when they get
started. I have devised an excellent plan, and it has Elliott's hearty
support. By Jove! if we can only manage it, it will be as pretty a ruse
as ever I heard of.
