      We had a pleasant little meal together, during which Holmes would
      talk about nothing but violins, narrating with great exultation
      how he had purchased his own Stradivarius, which was worth at
      least five hundred guineas, at a Jew brokerâ€™s in Tottenham Court
      Road for fifty-five shillings. This led him to Paganini, and we
      sat for an hour over a bottle of claret while he told me anecdote
      after anecdote of that extraordinary man. The afternoon was far
      advanced and the hot glare had softened into a mellow glow before
      we found ourselves at the police-station. Lestrade was waiting
      for us at the door.
