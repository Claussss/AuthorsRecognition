      â€œIt happens not unfrequently that I am sent for at strange hours
      by foreigners who get into difficulties, or by travelers who
      arrive late and wish my services. I was not surprised, therefore,
      on Monday night when a Mr. Latimer, a very fashionably dressed
      young man, came up to my rooms and asked me to accompany him in a
      cab which was waiting at the door. A Greek friend had come to see
      him upon business, he said, and as he could speak nothing but his
      own tongue, the services of an interpreter were indispensable. He
      gave me to understand that his house was some little distance
      off, in Kensington, and he seemed to be in a great hurry,
      bustling me rapidly into the cab when we had descended to the
      street.
