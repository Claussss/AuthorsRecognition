A line was measured down the valley, and Johnston, drawing an arrow to
the very head, sent it whistling over the row of wands. “Bravely drawn! A rare shoot!” shouted the bystanders. “It is well up to the fourth mark.” “By my hilt! it is over it,” cried Aylward. “I can see where they have
stooped to gather up the shaft.” “We shall hear anon,” said Johnston quietly, and presently a young
archer came running to say that the arrow had fallen twenty paces beyond
the fourth wand.
