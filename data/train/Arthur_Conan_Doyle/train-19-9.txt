So I was introduced to Miss Penclosa, and it did not escape me that as
my name was mentioned she glanced across at Agatha.  Wilson had
evidently been talking.  And presently, no doubt, thought I, she will
inform me by occult means that I am engaged to a young lady with
wheat-ears in her hair.  I wondered how much more Wilson had been
telling her about me. "Professor Gilroy is a terrible sceptic," said he; "I hope, Miss
Penclosa, that you will be able to convert him."
