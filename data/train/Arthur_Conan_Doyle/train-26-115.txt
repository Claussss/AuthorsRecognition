At the end of that time I returned through France. Having nothing to
read I happened to buy a volume of Maupassant's Tales which I had
never seen before. The first story was called "L'Auberge" (The
Inn)--and as I ran my eye down the printed page I was amazed to see
the two words, "Kandersteg" and "Gemmi Pass." I settled down and
read it with ever-growing amazement. The scene was laid in the inn I
had visited. The plot depended on the isolation of a group of people
through the snowfall. Everything that I imagined was there, save
that Maupassant had brought in a savage hound.
