      “Well, there’s no need for me to dwell on that part of it. You
      know now what James Barclay was capable of. Bhurtee was relieved
      by Neill next day, but the rebels took me away with them in their
      retreat, and it was many a long year before ever I saw a white
      face again. I was tortured and tried to get away, and was
      captured and tortured again. You can see for yourselves the state
      in which I was left. Some of them that fled into Nepaul took me
      with them, and then afterwards I was up past Darjeeling. The
      hill-folk up there murdered the rebels who had me, and I became
      their slave for a time until I escaped; but instead of going
      south I had to go north, until I found myself among the Afghans.
      There I wandered about for many a year, and at last came back to
      the Punjab, where I lived mostly among the natives and picked up
      a living by the conjuring tricks that I had learned. What use was
      it for me, a wretched cripple, to go back to England or to make
      myself known to my old comrades? Even my wish for revenge would
      not make me do that. I had rather that Nancy and my old pals
      should think of Harry Wood as having died with a straight back,
      than see him living and crawling with a stick like a chimpanzee.
      They never doubted that I was dead, and I meant that they never
      should. I heard that Barclay had married Nancy, and that he was
      rising rapidly in the regiment, but even that did not make me
      speak.
