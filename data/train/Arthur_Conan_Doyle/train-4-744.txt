My short delay and hesitation had sent a hot flush of anger into the
Dukeâ€™s face, so I drew the packet of papers from my inner pocket and
handed them to him with a respectful bow. As his eyes fell upon the
superscription, he gave a sudden start of surprise and agitation, making
a motion as though to hide them in his bosom. If this were his impulse
he overcame it, and sat lost in thought for a minute or more with the
papers in his hand. Then with a quick toss of the head, like a man who
hath formed his resolution, he broke the seals and cast his eyes over
the contents, which he then threw down upon the table with a bitter
laugh.
