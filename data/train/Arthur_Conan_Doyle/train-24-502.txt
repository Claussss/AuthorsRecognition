ensign,” Sir Nigel answered; “for, if I understand the matter aright, we
have but turned from one danger to the other.” “Good Master Hawtayne,” cried the boatswain, rushing aft, “the water
comes in upon us apace. The waves have driven in the sail wherewith we
strove to stop the hole.” As he spoke the seamen came swarming on to the
poop and the forecastle to avoid the torrent which poured through the
huge leak into the waist. High above the roar of the wind and the clash
of the sea rose the shrill half-human cries of the horses, as they found
the water rising rapidly around them.
