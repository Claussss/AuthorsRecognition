One morning--it was the second day of October--I was walking towards the
Hall, hoping that I might be fortunate enough to learn some news of my
darling, when I observed a man perched upon a stone at the side of the
road. As I came nearer to him I could see that he was a stranger, and from his
dusty clothes and dilapidated appearance he seemed to have come from a
distance. He had a great hunch of bread on his knee and a clasp-knife
in his hand, but he had apparently just finished his breakfast, for he
brushed the crumbs off his lap and rose to his feet when he perceived
me.
