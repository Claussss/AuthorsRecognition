To-night is the university ball, and I must go.  God knows I never felt
less in the humor for festivity, but I must not have it said that I am
unfit to appear in public.  If I am seen there, and have speech with
some of the elders of the university it will go a long way toward
showing them that it would be unjust to take my chair away from me. 10 P. M.  I have been to the ball.  Charles Sadler and I went together,
but I have come away before him.  I shall wait up for him, however,
for, indeed, I fear to go to sleep these nights.  He is a cheery,
practical fellow, and a chat with him will steady my nerves.  On the
whole, the evening was a great success.  I talked to every one who has
influence, and I think that I made them realize that my chair is not
vacant quite yet.  The creature was at the ball--unable to dance, of
course, but sitting with Mrs. Wilson.  Again and again her eyes rested
upon me.  They were almost the last things I saw before I left the
room.  Once, as I sat sideways to her, I watched her, and saw that her
gaze was following some one else.  It was Sadler, who was dancing at
the time with the second Miss Thurston.  To judge by her expression, it
is well for him that he is not in her grip as I am.  He does not know
the escape he has had.  I think I hear his step in the street now, and
I will go down and let him in.  If he will----
