Then I looked round for the means of getting off the roof and down into
the city. It was very evident that the simplest way by which I could get down was
that by which the sentinel had got up, and what this was soon became
evident. A voice along the roof called “Manuelo! Manuelo!” several
times, and, crouching in the shadow, I saw in the moonlight a bearded
head, which protruded from a trap-door. Receiving no answer to his summons, the man climbed through, followed
by three other fellows, all armed to the teeth. You will see here how
important it is not to neglect small precautions, for had I left the
man's gun where I found it, a search must have followed and I should
certainly have been discovered. As it was, the patrol saw no sign of
their sentry, and thought, no doubt, that he had moved along the line of
the roofs.
