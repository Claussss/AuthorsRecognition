      letter by the afternoon post yesterday. The envelope was
      destroyed by him.”       “Excellent!” cried Holmes, clapping the Inspector on the back.
      “You’ve seen the postman. It is a pleasure to work with you.
      Well, here is the lodge, and if you will come up, Colonel, I will
      show you the scene of the crime.”
