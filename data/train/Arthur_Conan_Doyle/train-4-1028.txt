he. ‘Your company!’ Saxon cried. ‘Why, man, you are mad! Your company is cut
off to the last man.’ ‘That’s what I mean,’ he answered, flicking some dirt from his cravat.
‘Don’t ye mind! Look out for yourselves. Goodbye, Clarke! Present my
compliments to--’ The dragoons charged down upon us again. We were all
borne backwards, fighting desperately, and when we could look round the
Baronet was gone for ever. We heard afterwards that the King’s troops
found upon the field a body which they mistook for that of Monmouth, on
account of the effeminate grace of the features and the richness of the
attire. No doubt it was that of our undaunted friend, Sir Gervas Jerome,
a name which shall ever be dear to my heart. When, ten years afterwards,
we heard much of the gallantry of the young courtiers of the household
of the French King, and of the sprightly courage with which they fought
against us in the Lowlands at Steinkirk and elsewhere, I have always
thought, from my recollection of Sir Gervas, that I knew what manner of
men they were.
