      “So that was the end of my adventure, Mr. Holmes. I do not know
      where I was, nor whom I spoke with, nor anything save what I have
      told you. But I know that there is foul play going on, and I want
      to help that unhappy man if I can. I told the whole story to Mr.
      Mycroft Holmes next morning, and subsequently to the police.”       We all sat in silence for some little time after listening to
      this extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock looked across at his
      brother.
