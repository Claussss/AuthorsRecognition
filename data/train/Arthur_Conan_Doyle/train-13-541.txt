      “What happened was this. Two days ago I received the letter which
      I now read to you. Neither address nor date is attached to it.       “‘A Russian nobleman who is now resident in England,’ it runs,
      ‘would be glad to avail himself of the professional assistance of
      Dr. Percy Trevelyan. He has been for some years a victim to
      cataleptic attacks, on which, as is well known, Dr. Trevelyan is
      an authority. He proposes to call at about quarter past six
      to-morrow evening, if Dr. Trevelyan will make it convenient to be
      at home.’
