      seen pictures and read descriptions of the famous old building,
      so I will confine my account of it to saying that it is built in
      the shape of an L, the long arm being the more modern portion,
      and the shorter the ancient nucleus, from which the other had
      developed. Over the low, heavily-lintelled door, in the centre of
      this old part, is chiseled the date, 1607, but experts are agreed

      enormously thick walls and tiny windows of this part had in the
      last century driven the family into building the new wing, and
      the old one was used now as a storehouse and a cellar, when it
      was used at all. A splendid park with fine old timber surrounds
      the house, and the lake, to which my client had referred, lay
      close to the avenue, about two hundred yards from the building.
