Sherlock Holmes and I read these notices over together at breakfast, and
they appeared to afford him considerable amusement. “I told you that, whatever happened, Lestrade and Gregson would be sure
to score.” “That depends on how it turns out.” “Oh, bless you, it doesn’t matter in the least. If the man is caught, it
will be _on account_ of their exertions; if he escapes, it will be _in
spite_ of their exertions. It’s heads I win and tails you lose. Whatever
they do, they will have followers. ‘Un sot trouve toujours un plus sot
qui l’admire.’”
