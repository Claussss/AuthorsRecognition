“Simon,” said Nigel, “before we go farther we will take this outer door
from its hinges. With it we will block this passage so that at the worst
we may hold our ground here until help comes. Do you back to the camp
as fast as your feet can bear you. The peasants will draw you upward
through the hole. Give my greetings to Sir Robert and tell him that the
castle is taken without fail if he comes this way with fifty men. Say
that we have made a lodgment within the walls. And tell him also, Simon,
that I would counsel him to make a stir before the gateway so that the
guard may be held there whilst we make good our footing behind them. Go,
good Simon, and lose not a moment!”
