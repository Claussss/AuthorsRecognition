“I will neither drink your wine nor sit at your table,” returned the
other. “I bear no love for you or for your race, and there is nought
that I wish at your hands until the day when I see the last sail which
bears you back to your island vanishing away against the western sky.” “These are bitter words, sir knight,” said Prince Edward, with an angry
frown. “And they come from a bitter heart,” answered the unknown knight. “How
long is it since there has been peace in my hapless country? Where are
the steadings, and orchards, and vineyards, which made France fair?
Where are the cities which made her great? From Providence to Burgundy
we are beset by every prowling hireling in Christendom, who rend and
tear the country which you have left too weak to guard her own marches.
Is it not a by-word that a man may ride all day in that unhappy land
without seeing thatch upon roof or hearing the crow of cock? Does not
one fair kingdom content you, that you should strive so for this other
one which has no love for you? Pardieu! a true Frenchman's words may
well be bitter, for bitter is his lot and bitter his thoughts as he
rides through his thrice unhappy country.”
