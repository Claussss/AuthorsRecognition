The Abbot had opened his mouth to reply, when the consultation was
interrupted by a most unwonted buzz of excitement from among the monks
in the cloister below. Questions and answers in excited voices sounded
from one side of the ambulatory to the other. Sacrist and Abbot were
gazing at each other in amazement at such a breach of the discipline and
decorum of their well-trained flock, when there came a swift step upon
the stair, and a white-faced brother flung open the door and rushed into
the room.
