that is fitting out against the Indians, who have ravaged the
plantations of our settlers. It will be good to get to some profitable
employment, for such a war, without either fighting or plunder, I have
never seen. I give you my word that I have scarce fingered silver since
the beginning of it. I would not for the sacking of London go through
with it again.’
