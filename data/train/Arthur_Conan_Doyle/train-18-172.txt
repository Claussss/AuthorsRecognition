The general tuk nae heed o't, but walked on and was soon oot o' sicht,
and I didna lose a minute in creepin' oot frae my hidin' place and
scamperin' awa' back tae my room, and if a' the bogies in the Red Sea
were trapesin' up and doon the hale nicht through, I wud never put my
heid oot again tae hae a glimpse o' them. I didna say a word tae anybody aboot what I'd seen, but I made up my
mind that I wudna stay muckle langer at Cloomber Ha'. Four pund a month
is a good wage, but it isna enough tae pay a man for the loss o' his
peace o' mind, and maybe the loss o' his soul as weel, for when the deil
is aboot ye canna tell what sort o' a trap he may lay for ye, and though
they say that Providence is stronger than him, it's maybe as weel no' to
risk it.
