Apart from this particular epoch, French literature, which is so
rich in all its branches, is richest of all in its memoirs. Whenever
there was anything of interest going forward there was always some
kindly gossip who knew all about it, and was ready to set it down
for the benefit of posterity. Our own history has not nearly enough
of these charming sidelights. Look at our sailors in the Napoleonic
wars, for example. They played an epoch-making part. For nearly
twenty years Freedom was a Refugee upon the seas. Had our navy been
swept away, then all Europe would have been one organized despotism.
At times everybody was against us, fighting against their own direct
interests under the pressure of that terrible hand. We fought on the
waters with the French, with the Spaniards, with the Danes, with the
Russians, with the Turks, even with our American kinsmen. Middies
grew into post-captains, and admirals into dotards during that
prolonged struggle. And what have we in literature to show for it
all? Marryat's novels, many of which are founded upon personal
experience, Nelson's and Collingwood's letters, Lord Cochrane's
biography--that is about all. I wish we had more of Collingwood,
for he wielded a fine pen. Do you remember the sonorous opening of
his Trafalgar message to his captains?--
