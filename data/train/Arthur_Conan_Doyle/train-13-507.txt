      “There was her statement, Watson, and to me, as you can imagine,
      it was like a light on a dark night. Everything which had been
      disconnected before began at once to assume its true place, and I
      had a shadowy presentiment of the whole sequence of events. My
      next step obviously was to find the man who had produced such a
      remarkable impression upon Mrs. Barclay. If he were still in
      Aldershot it should not be a very difficult matter. There are not
      such a very great number of civilians, and a deformed man was
      sure to have attracted attention. I spent a day in the search,
      and by evening—this very evening, Watson—I had run him down. The
      man’s name is Henry Wood, and he lives in lodgings in this same
      street in which the ladies met him. He has only been five days in
      the place. In the character of a registration-agent I had a most
      interesting gossip with his landlady. The man is by trade a
      conjurer and performer, going round the canteens after nightfall,
      and giving a little entertainment at each. He carries some
      creature about with him in that box; about which the landlady
      seemed to be in considerable trepidation, for she had never seen
      an animal like it. He uses it in some of his tricks according to
      her account. So much the woman was able to tell me, and also that
      it was a wonder the man lived, seeing how twisted he was, and
      that he spoke in a strange tongue sometimes, and that for the
      last two nights she had heard him groaning and weeping in his
      bedroom. He was all right, as far as money went, but in his
      deposit he had given her what looked like a bad florin. She
      showed it to me, Watson, and it was an Indian rupee.
