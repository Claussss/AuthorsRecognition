      “Precisely,” said Holmes.       “Then Blessington must have been Sutton.”       “Exactly,” said Holmes.       “Why, that makes it as clear as crystal,” said the inspector.       But Trevelyan and I looked at each other in bewilderment.       “You must surely remember the great Worthingdon bank business,”
      said Holmes. “Five men were in it—these four and a fifth called
      Cartwright. Tobin, the caretaker, was murdered, and the thieves
      got away with seven thousand pounds. This was in 1875. They were
      all five arrested, but the evidence against them was by no means
      conclusive. This Blessington or Sutton, who was the worst of the
      gang, turned informer. On his evidence Cartwright was hanged and
      the other three got fifteen years apiece. When they got out the
      other day, which was some years before their full term, they set
      themselves, as you perceive, to hunt down the traitor and to
      avenge the death of their comrade upon him. Twice they tried to
      get at him and failed; a third time, you see, it came off. Is
      there anything further which I can explain, Dr. Trevelyan?”
