“Who let you out?” “Mrs. Porter had gone to bed, so I let myself out. I shut the hall door
behind me. The window of the room in which they sat was closed, but the
blind was not drawn down. There was no change in door or window this
morning, or any reason to think that any stranger had been to the
house. Yet there they sat, driven clean mad with terror, and Brenda
lying dead of fright, with her head hanging over the arm of the chair.
I’ll never get the sight of that room out of my mind so long as I
live.”
