      “This is the street,” said he, as we turned into a short
      thoroughfare lined with plain two-storied brick houses. “Ah, here
      is Simpson to report.”       “He’s in all right, Mr. Holmes,” cried a small street Arab,
      running up to us.       “Good, Simpson!” said Holmes, patting him on the head. “Come
      along, Watson. This is the house.” He sent in his card with a
      message that he had come on important business, and a moment
      later we were face to face with the man whom we had come to see.
      In spite of the warm weather he was crouching over a fire, and
      the little room was like an oven. The man sat all twisted and
      huddled in his chair in a way which gave an indescribable
      impression of deformity; but the face which he turned towards us,
      though worn and swarthy, must at some time have been remarkable
      for its beauty. He looked suspiciously at us now out of
      yellow-shot, bilious eyes, and, without speaking or rising, he
      waved towards two chairs.
