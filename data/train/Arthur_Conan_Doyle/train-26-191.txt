The story of Father Jogue is but one of many, and yet it is worth
recounting, as showing the spirit of the men. He also was on the
Iroquois Mission, and was so tortured and mutilated by his sweet
parishioners that the very dogs used to howl at his distorted
figure. He made his way back to France, not for any reason of
personal rest or recuperation, but because he needed a special
dispensation to say Mass. The Catholic Church has a regulation
that a priest shall not be deformed, so that the savages with
their knives had wrought better than they knew. He received his
dispensation and was sent for by Louis XIV., who asked him what he
could do for him. No doubt the assembled courtiers expected to hear
him ask for the next vacant Bishopric. What he did actually ask for,
as the highest favour, was to be sent back to the Iroquois Mission,
where the savages signalized his arrival by burning him alive.
