‘Do so,’ said I, ‘and I shall take care that King Monmouth shall hear of
the help which ye have given his messenger.’ ‘Well, we shall be there in a brace of shakes,’ he remarked. ‘Let us go
below and load your ground tier, for there is nothing like starting well
trimmed with plenty of ballast in the hold.’ Following the sailor’s advice I went down with him and enjoyed a rude
but plentiful meal. By the time that we had finished, the lugger had
been run into a narrow creek, with shelving sandy banks on either side.
The district was wild and marshy, with few signs of any inhabitants.
With much coaxing and pushing Covenant was induced to take to the water,
and swam easily ashore, while I followed in the smuggler’s dinghy. A
few words of rough, kindly leave-taking were shouted after me; I saw the
dinghy return, and the beautiful craft glided out to sea and faded away
once more into the mists which still hung over the face of the waters.
