‘It is the verger, sirs,’ said one of the townsfolk. ‘He hath grown grey
in the Cathedral.’ ‘This way to the vestry door, my lords and gentlemen,’ cried the old
man, pushing a way strenuously through the crowd. ‘Now, lack-a-day, the
sainted Paul hath gone too!’ As he spoke a splintering crash from inside the Cathedral announced some
fresh outrage on the part of the zealots. Our guide hastened on with
renewed speed, until he came to a low oaken door heavily arched, which
he unlocked with much rasping of wards and creaking of hinges. Through
this we sidled as best we might, and hurried after the old man down a
stone-flagged corridor, which led through a wicket into the Cathedral
close by the high altar.
