 The inspector was annoyed. “You know my methods of work, Mr. Mac. But I will hold it back for the

which can very readily be done, and then I make my bow and return to
London, leaving my results entirely at your service. I owe you too much
to act otherwise; for in all my experience I cannot recall any more
singular and interesting study.”
