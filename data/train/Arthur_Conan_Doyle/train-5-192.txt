So interested was I that next morning I was on the look out for him.
Sure enough, at the same hour, I saw him coming up the hill; but very
slowly, with a bent back and a heavy head.  It was shocking to me to
see the change in him as he approached. "I am afraid that our air does not agree with you, sir," I ventured to
remark. But it was as though he had no heart for talk.  He tried, as I thought,
to make some fitting reply, but it slurred off into a mumble and
silence.  How bent and weak and old he seemed--ten years older at the
least than when first I had seen him!  It went to my heart to see this
fine old fellow wasting away before my eyes.  There was the eternal
letter which he unfolded with his shaking fingers.  Who was this woman
whose words moved him so?  Some daughter, perhaps, or granddaughter,
who should have been the light of his home instead of----  I smiled to
find how bitter I was growing, and how swiftly I was weaving a romance
round an unshaven old man and his correspondence.  Yet all day he
lingered in my mind, and I had fitful glimpses of those two trembling,
blue-veined, knuckly hands with the paper rustling between them.
