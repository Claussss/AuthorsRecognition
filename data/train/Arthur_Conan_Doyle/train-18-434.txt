As we approached the fringe of rushes which marked its border, a foul,
dank smell rose up from the stagnant wilderness, as from impure water
and decaying vegetation--an earthy, noisome smell which poisoned the
fresh upland air. So forbidding and gloomy was the aspect of the place that our stout
crofter hesitated, and it was all that we could do to persuade him
to proceed. Our lurcher, however, not being subject to the delicate
impressions of our higher organisation, still ran yelping along with its
nose on the ground and every fibre of its body quivering with excitement
and eagerness.
