Headingly nodded approvingly. “Each has its own mission. Germany is predominant in abstract thought;
France in literature, art, and grace. But we and you,--for the
English-speakers are all in the same boat, however much the _New York
Sun_ may scream over it,--we and you have among our best men a higher
conception of moral sense and public duty than is to be found in any
other people. Now, these are the two qualities which are needed for
directing a weaker race. You can't help them by abstract thought or by
graceful art, but only by that moral sense which will hold the scales of
Justice even, and keep itself free from every taint of corruption. That
is how we rule India. We came there by a kind of natural law, like air
rushing into a vacuum. All over the world, against our direct interests
and our deliberate intentions, we are drawn into the same thing. And
it will happen to you also. The pressure of destiny will force you to
administer the whole of America from Mexico to the Horn.”
