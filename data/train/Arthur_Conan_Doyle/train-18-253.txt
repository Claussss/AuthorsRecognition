The first pale light of dawn was just appearing in the east when we made
our way for the second time to the scene of the shipwreck. The gale had
blown itself out, but the sea was still very high, and all inside the
breakers was a seething, gleaming line of foam, as though the fierce old
ocean were gnashing its white fangs at the victims who had escaped from
its clutches. All along the beach fishermen and crofters were hard at work hauling up
spars and barrels as fast as they were tossed ashore. None of them had
seen any bodies, however, and they explained to us that only such things
as could float had any chance of coming ashore, for the undercurrent was
so strong that whatever was beneath the surface must infallibly be swept
out to sea.
