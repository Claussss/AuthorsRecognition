“The latest scientific data do not bear out the idea that the earth
is so hot,” answered Raffles Haw. “It is certain that the increased
temperature in coal mines depends upon the barometric pressure. There
are gases in the earth which may be ignited, and there are combustible
materials as we see in the volcanoes; but if we came across anything of
the sort in our borings, we could turn a river or two down the shaft,
and get the better of it in that fashion.”
