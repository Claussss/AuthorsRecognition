      Only one word of epilogue. The American, Abe Slaney, was
      condemned to death at the winter assizes at Norwich, but his
      penalty was changed to penal servitude in consideration of
      mitigating circumstances, and the certainty that Hilton Cubitt
      had fired the first shot. Of Mrs. Hilton Cubitt I only know that
      I have heard she recovered entirely, and that she still remains a
      widow, devoting her whole life to the care of the poor and to the
      administration of her husbandâ€™s estate.
