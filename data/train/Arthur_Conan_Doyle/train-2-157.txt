It was a nice equipment for a respectable citizen to carry through the
dim, fog-draped streets. I stowed them all discreetly away in my
overcoat and drove straight to the address given. There sat my friend
at a little round table near the door of the garish Italian restaurant. “Have you had something to eat? Then join me in a coffee and curaçao.
Try one of the proprietor’s cigars. They are less poisonous than one
would expect. Have you the tools?”
