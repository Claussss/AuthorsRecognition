"What the deuce can have frightened him so?" he asked. "It's the mummy." "The mummy?  How, then?" "I don't know.  It's beastly and morbid.  I wish he would drop it.
It's the second fright he has given me.  It was the same last winter.
I found him just like this, with that horrid thing in front of him." "What does he want with the mummy, then?" "Oh, he's a crank, you know.  It's his hobby.  He knows more about
these things than any man in England.  But I wish he wouldn't!  Ah,
he's beginning to come to."
