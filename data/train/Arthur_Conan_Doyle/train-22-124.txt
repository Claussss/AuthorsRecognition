“How long were you with Douglas in California?” asked Inspector
MacDonald. “Five years altogether.” “He was a bachelor, you say?” “A widower.” “Have you ever heard where his first wife came from?” “No, I remember his saying that she was of German extraction, and I have
seen her portrait. She was a very beautiful woman. She died of typhoid
the year before I met him.” “You don't associate his past with any particular part of America?”
