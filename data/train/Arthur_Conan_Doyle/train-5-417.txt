"What, then?  Have we come down to spooks?" Abercrombie Smith puffed his scientific contempt. "Well, no; I don't think that is quite the idea, either.  I am inclined
to think that if any showman has lost a great ape lately, and the brute
is in these parts, a jury would find a true bill against it.  Norton
passes that way every night, you know, about the same hour.  There's a
tree that hangs low over the path--the big elm from Rainy's garden.
Norton thinks the thing dropped on him out of the tree.  Anyhow, he was
nearly strangled by two arms, which, he says, were as strong and as
thin as steel bands.  He saw nothing; only those beastly arms that
tightened and tightened on him.  He yelled his head nearly off, and a
couple of chaps came running, and the thing went over the wall like a
cat.  He never got a fair sight of it the whole time.  It gave Norton a
shake up, I can tell you.  I tell him it has been as good as a change
at the sea-side for him."
