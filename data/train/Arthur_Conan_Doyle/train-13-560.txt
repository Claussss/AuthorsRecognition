      “And the catalepsy?”       “A fraudulent imitation, Watson, though I should hardly dare to
      hint as much to our specialist. It is a very easy complaint to
      imitate. I have done it myself.”       “And then?”       “By the purest chance Blessington was out on each occasion. Their
      reason for choosing so unusual an hour for a consultation was
      obviously to insure that there should be no other patient in the
      waiting-room. It just happened, however, that this hour coincided
      with Blessington’s constitutional, which seems to show that they
      were not very well acquainted with his daily routine. Of course,
      if they had been merely after plunder they would at least have
      made some attempt to search for it. Besides, I can read in a
      man’s eye when it is his own skin that he is frightened for. It
      is inconceivable that this fellow could have made two such
      vindictive enemies as these appear to be without knowing of it. I
      hold it, therefore, to be certain that he does know who these men
      are, and that for reasons of his own he suppresses it. It is just
      possible that to-morrow may find him in a more communicative
      mood.”
