Into the chamber they went in all peace and concord, where the Lady
Tiphaine sat like queen on throne for each in turn to be presented to
her. Sooth to say, the stout heart of Sir Nigel, which cared little for
the wrath of her lion-like spouse, was somewhat shaken by the calm, cold
face of this stately dame, for twenty years of camp-life had left him
more at ease in the lists than in a lady's boudoir. He bethought him,
too, as he looked at her set lips and deep-set questioning eyes, that he
had heard strange tales of this same Lady Tiphaine du Guesclin. Was
it not she who was said to lay hands upon the sick and raise them from
their couches when the leeches had spent their last nostrums? Had she
not forecast the future, and were there not times when in the loneliness
of her chamber she was heard to hold converse with some being upon whom
mortal eye never rested--some dark familiar who passed where doors were
barred and windows high? Sir Nigel sunk his eye and marked a cross on
the side of his leg as he greeted this dangerous dame, and yet ere
five minutes had passed he was hers, and not he only but his two young
squires as well. The mind had gone out of them, and they could but look
at this woman and listen to the words which fell from her lips--words
which thrilled through their nerves and stirred their souls like the
battle-call of a bugle.
