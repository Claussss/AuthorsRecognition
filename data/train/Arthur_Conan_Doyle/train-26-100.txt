One would like a little more from the gallant Captain. Poor
Broughton! He fought once too often. "Why, damn you, you're beat!"
cried the Royal Duke. "Not beat, your highness, but I can't see my
man!" cried the blinded old hero. Alas, there is the tragedy of the
ring as it is of life! The wave of youth surges ever upwards, and
the wave that went before is swept sobbing on to the shingle. "Youth
will be served," said the terse old pugs. But what so sad as the
downfall of the old champion! Wise Tom Spring--Tom of Bedford, as
Borrow calls him--had the wit to leave the ring unconquered in
the prime of his fame. Cribb also stood out as a champion. But
Broughton, Slack, Belcher, and the rest--their end was one common
tragedy.
