So much for the eighteenth-century novelists. They have a shelf of
their own in the case, and a corner of their own in my brain. For
years you may never think of them, and then suddenly some stray word
or train of thought leads straight to them, and you look at them
and love them, and rejoice that you know them. But let us pass to
something which may interest you more. If statistics could be taken in the various free libraries of the
kingdom to prove the comparative popularity of different novelists
with the public, I think that it is quite certain that Mr. George
Meredith would come out very low indeed. If, on the other hand,
a number of authors were convened to determine which of their
fellow-craftsmen they considered the greatest and the most
stimulating to their own minds, I am equally confident that Mr.
Meredith would have a vast preponderance of votes. Indeed, his only
conceivable rival would be Mr. Hardy. It becomes an interesting
study, therefore, why there should be such a divergence of opinion
as to his merits, and what the qualities are which have repelled
so many readers, and yet have attracted those whose opinion must
be allowed to have a special weight.
