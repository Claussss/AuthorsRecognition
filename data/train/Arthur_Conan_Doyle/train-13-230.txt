      “At last I saw a vacancy at Mawson & Williams’, the great
      stockbroking firm in Lombard Street. I daresay E.C. is not much
      in your line, but I can tell you that this is about the richest
      house in London. The advertisement was to be answered by letter
      only. I sent in my testimonial and application, but without the
      least hope of getting it. Back came an answer by return, saying
      that if I would appear next Monday I might take over my new
      duties at once, provided that my appearance was satisfactory. No
      one knows how these things are worked. Some people say that the
      manager just plunges his hand into the heap and takes the first
      that comes. Anyhow it was my innings that time, and I don’t ever
      wish to feel better pleased. The screw was a pound a week rise,
      and the duties just about the same as at Coxon’s.
