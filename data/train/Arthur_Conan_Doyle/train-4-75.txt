‘Indeed!’ quoth my father. ‘You are yourself one of the faithful?’ ‘I trust that I am one of those who are on the narrow and thorny track,’
said he, speaking through his nose, as was the habit of the extreme
sectaries. ‘A track upon which no prelate can guide us,’ said my father. ‘Where man is nought and the Lord is all,’ rejoined Saxon. ‘Good! good!’ cried my father. ‘Micah, you shall take this worthy man
to my room, and see that he hath dry linen, and my second-best suit of
Utrecht velvet. It may serve until his own are dried. My boots, too,
may perchance be useful--my riding ones of untanned leather. A hat with
silver braiding hangs above them in the cupboard. See that he lacks for
nothing which the house can furnish. Supper will be ready when he hath
changed his attire. I beg that you will go at once, good Master Saxon,
lest you take a chill.’
