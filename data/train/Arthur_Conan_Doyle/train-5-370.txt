"I had a case some little time ago which was out of the ordinary," says
the surgeon.  "There's a famous beauty in London society--I mention no
names--who used to be remarkable a few seasons ago for the very low
dresses which she would wear.  She had the whitest of skins and most
beautiful of shoulders, so it was no wonder.  Then gradually the
frilling at her neck lapped upwards and upwards, until last year she
astonished everyone by wearing quite a high collar at a time when it
was completely out of fashion.  Well, one day this very woman was shown
into my consulting-room.  When the footman was gone she suddenly tore
off the upper part of her dress.  'For Gods sake do something for me!'
she cried.  Then I saw what the trouble was.  A rodent ulcer was eating
its way upwards, coiling on in its serpiginous fashion until the end of
it was flush with her collar.  The red streak of its trail was lost
below the line of her bust.  Year by year it had ascended and she had
heightened her dress to hide it, until now it was about to invade her
face.  She had been too proud to confess her trouble, even to a medical
man."
