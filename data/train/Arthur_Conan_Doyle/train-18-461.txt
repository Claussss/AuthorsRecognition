For what is science? Science is the consensus of opinion of scientific
men, and history has shown that it is slow to accept a truth. Science
sneered at Newton for twenty years. Science proved mathematically that
an iron ship could not swim, and science declared that a steamship could
not cross the Atlantic. Like Goethe's Mephistopheles, our wise professor's forte is “stets
verneinen.” Thomas Didymus is, to use his own jargon, his prototype. Let
him learn that if he will but cease to believe in the infallibility
of his own methods, and will look to the East, from which all great
movements come, he will find there a school of philosophers and of
savants who, working on different lines from his own, are many thousand
years ahead of him in all the essentials of knowledge.
