Each new course, heralded by a flourish of silver trumpets, was borne
in by liveried servants walking two and two, with rubicund marshals
strutting in front and behind, bearing white wands in their hands, not
only as badges of their office, but also as weapons with which to repel
any impertinent inroad upon the dishes in the journey from the kitchen
to the hall. Boar's heads, enarmed and endored with gilt tusks and
flaming mouths, were followed by wondrous pasties molded to the shape of
ships, castles and other devices with sugar seamen or soldiers who lost
their own bodies in their fruitless defense against the hungry attack.
Finally came the great nef, a silver vessel upon wheels laden with fruit
and sweetmeats which rolled with its luscious cargo down the line of
guests. Flagons of Gascony, of Rhine wine, of Canary and of Rochelle
were held in readiness by the attendants; but the age, though luxurious,
was not drunken, and the sober habits of the Norman had happily
prevailed over the license of those Saxon banquets where no guest might
walk from the table without a slur upon his host. Honor and hardihood go
ill with a shaking hand or a blurred eye.
