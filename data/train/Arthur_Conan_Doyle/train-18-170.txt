For a moment it cam into my held that maybe he was walkin' in his sleep,
but as he cam towards me I could see the glint o' the licht in his e'en,
and his face was a' twistin', like a man that's in sair distress o'
mind. On my conscience, it gies me the shakes noo when I think o' his
tall figure and his yelley face comin' sae solemn and silent doon the
lang, lone passage. I haud my breath and lay close watchin' him, but just as he cam tae
where I was my vera hairt stood still in my breast, for “ting!”--loud
and clear, within a yaird o' me cam the ringin', clangin' soond that I
had a'ready hairkened tae.
