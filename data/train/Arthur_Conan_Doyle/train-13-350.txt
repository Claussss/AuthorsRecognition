      â€œReginald Musgrave had been in the same college as myself, and I
      had some slight acquaintance with him. He was not generally
      popular among the undergraduates, though it always seemed to me
      that what was set down as pride was really an attempt to cover
      extreme natural diffidence. In appearance he was a man of
      exceedingly aristocratic type, thin, high-nosed, and large-eyed,
      with languid and yet courtly manners. He was indeed a scion of
      one of the very oldest families in the kingdom, though his branch
      was a cadet one which had separated from the northern Musgraves
      some time in the sixteenth century, and had established itself in
      western Sussex, where the Manor House of Hurlstone is perhaps the
      oldest inhabited building in the county. Something of his
      birthplace seemed to cling to the man, and I never looked at his
      pale, keen face or the poise of his head without associating him
      with grey archways and mullioned windows and all the venerable
      wreckage of a feudal keep. Once or twice we drifted into talk,
      and I can remember that more than once he expressed a keen
      interest in my methods of observation and inference.
