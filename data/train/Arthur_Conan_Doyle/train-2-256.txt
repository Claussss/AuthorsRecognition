“Well, well, Mrs. Warren, let us hear about it, then. You don’t object
to tobacco, I take it? Thank you, Watson—the matches! You are uneasy,
as I understand, because your new lodger remains in his rooms and you
cannot see him. Why, bless you, Mrs. Warren, if I were your lodger you
often would not see me for weeks on end.” “No doubt, sir; but this is different. It frightens me, Mr. Holmes. I
can’t sleep for fright. To hear his quick step moving here and moving
there from early morning to late at night, and yet never to catch so
much as a glimpse of him—it’s more than I can stand. My husband is as
nervous over it as I am, but he is out at his work all day, while I get
no rest from it. What is he hiding for? What has he done? Except for
the girl, I am all alone in the house with him, and it’s more than my
nerves can stand.”
