      “He’s a fine fellow,” said Holmes, as we came out into Whitehall.
      “But he has a struggle to keep up his position. He is far from
      rich and has many calls. You noticed, of course, that his boots
      had been resoled. Now, Watson, I won’t detain you from your
      legitimate work any longer. I shall do nothing more to-day,
      unless I have an answer to my cab advertisement. But I should be
      extremely obliged to you if you would come down with me to Woking
      to-morrow, by the same train which we took yesterday.”
