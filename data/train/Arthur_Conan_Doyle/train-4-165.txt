‘Nor does that end all,’ I remarked. ‘No. There is Tophet behind and the flames of hell. So our good friends
the parsons tell us. Well, if a man is to make no money in this world,
be hanged at the end of it, and finally burn for ever, he hath assuredly
wandered on to a thorny track. If, on the other hand, one could always
lay one’s hands on a well-lined purse, as those rogues have done
to-night, one might be content to risk something in the world to come.’
