The Brandenburger showed his white teeth in a grin as he held out his
broad brown hand to me. The instant that mine was enclosed in it he
suddenly bent his whole strength upon it, and squeezed my fingers
together until the blood tingled in the nails, and the whole hand was
limp and powerless. ‘Donnerwetter!’ he cried, laughing heartily at my start of pain and
surprise. ‘It is a rough Prussian game, and the English lads have not
much stomach for it.’
