suit for which he had yearned so short a time before. Then and there he
tried it on in the booth, Wat and his boy walking round him with spanner
and wrench, fixing bolts and twisting rivets. “How is that, my fair sir?” cried the armorer as he drew the bassinet
over the head and fastened it to the camail which extended to the
shoulders. “I swear by Tubal Cain that it fits you as the shell fits the
crab! A finer suit never came from Italy or Spain.”
