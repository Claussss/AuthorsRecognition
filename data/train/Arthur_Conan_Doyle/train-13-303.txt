      â€œAll this occurred during the first month of the long vacation. I
      went up to my London rooms, where I spent seven weeks working out
      a few experiments in organic chemistry. One day, however, when
      the autumn was far advanced and the vacation drawing to a close,
      I received a telegram from my friend imploring me to return to
      Donnithorpe, and saying that he was in great need of my advice
      and assistance. Of course I dropped everything and set out for
      the North once more.
