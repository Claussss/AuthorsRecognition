No, if I had three votes, I should plump them all for "The Cloister
and the Hearth," as being our greatest historical novel, and,
indeed, as being our greatest novel of any sort. I think I may claim
to have read most of the more famous foreign novels of last century,
and (speaking only for myself and within the limits of my reading)
I have been more impressed by that book of Reade's and by Tolstoi's
"Peace and War" than by any others. They seem to me to stand at the
very top of the century's fiction. There is a certain resemblance
in the two--the sense of space, the number of figures, the way in
which characters drop in and drop out. The Englishman is the more
romantic. The Russian is the more real and earnest. But they are
both great.
