To continue the survey of the operations in the Cape, the first point
scored was by the invaders, for Malan's commando succeeded upon May 13th
in overwhelming a strong patrol of the Midland Mounted Rifles, the local
colonial corps, to the south of Maraisburg. Six killed, eleven wounded,
and forty-one prisoners were the fruits of his little victory, which
furnished him also with a fresh supply of rifles and ammunition. On May
21st Crabbe's column was in touch with Lotter and with Lategan, but no
very positive result came from the skirmish.
