“Too extraordinary to be a coincidence,” growled the mate. “I saw
them during the calm yesterday morning, pointing to the land over our
starboard quarter. They knew well enough that that was the port they
were making for.” “What do you make of it all, then, Hawkins?” asked the captain, with a
troubled face. “What is your own theory on the matter?” “Why, in my opinion,” the mate answered, “them three swabs have no more
difficulty in raising a gale o' wind than I should have in swallowing
this here grog. They had reasons o' their own for coming to this
God-forsaken--saving your presence, sirs--this God-forsaken bay, and
they took a short cut to it by arranging to be blown ashore there.
That's my idea o' the matter, though what three Buddhist priests could
find to do in the Bay of Kirkmaiden is clean past my comprehension.”
