‘Well struck!’ ‘A brave stroke!’ cried the spectators. ‘It is proof
steel thrice welded, and warranted to turn a sword-blade,’ one remarked,
raising up the helmet to examine it, and then replacing it upon the
stool. ‘I have seen my father cut through proof steel with this very sword,’
said I, drawing the fifty-year-old weapon. ‘He put rather more of his
weight into it than you have done. I have heard him say that a good
stroke should come from the back and loins rather than from the mere
muscles of the arm.’
