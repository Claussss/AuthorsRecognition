The rising power of the people, the growing wealth of the Church, the
increasing luxury in life and manners, and the gentler tone of the age
were all equally abhorrent to her, so that the dread of her fierce face,
and even of the heavy oak staff with which she supported her failing
limbs, was widespread through all the country round. Yet if she was feared she was also respected, for in days when books
were few and readers scarce, a long memory and a ready tongue were of
the more value; and where, save from Dame Ermyntrude, could the young
unlettered Squires of Surrey and Hampshire hear of their grandfathers
and their battles, or learn that lore of heraldry and chivalry which she
handed down from a ruder but a more martial age? Poor as she was, there
was no one in Surrey whose guidance would be more readily sought upon a
question of precedence or of conduct than the Dame Ermyntrude Loring.
