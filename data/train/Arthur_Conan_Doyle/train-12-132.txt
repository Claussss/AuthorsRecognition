“The poor burglars!” cried Laura. “It is no wonder that they look
bewildered, for I suppose, Mr. Haw, that they neither know where they
are, nor how they came there. I am so glad to know that you guard
yourself in this way, for I have often thought that you ran a danger.” “Have you so?” said he, smiling round at her. “I think that my house
is fairly burglar-proof. I have one window which may be used as an
entrance, the centre one of the three of my laboratory. I keep it so
because, to tell the truth, I am somewhat of a night prowler myself, and
when I treat myself to a ramble under the stars I like to slip in and
out without ceremony. It would, however, be a fortunate rogue who picked
the only safe entrance out of a hundred, and even then he might find
pitfalls. Here is the constable, but you must not go, for Miss McIntyre
has still something to see in my little place. If you will step into the
billiard-room I shall be with you in a very few moments.”
