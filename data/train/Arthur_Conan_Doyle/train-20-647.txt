      “Well, Wilson, any news?”       “No, sir—nothing.”       “No reports of any stranger seen?”       “No, sir. Down at the station they are certain that no stranger
      either came or went yesterday.”       “Have you had inquiries made at inns and lodgings?”       “Yes, sir: there is no one that we cannot account for.”       “Well, it’s only a reasonable walk to Chatham. Anyone might stay
      there or take a train without being observed. This is the garden
      path of which I spoke, Mr. Holmes. I’ll pledge my word there was
      no mark on it yesterday.”
