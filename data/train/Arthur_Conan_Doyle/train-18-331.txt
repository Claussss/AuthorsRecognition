“What is it?” I asked, in a subdued voice. “It's the sound of a man running towards us,” she answered, and then,
suddenly dropping the last semblance of self-command, she fell upon
her knees beside the table and began praying aloud with that frenzied
earnestness which intense, overpowering fear can produce, breaking off
now and again into half-hysterical whimperings. I could distinguish the sound clearly enough now to know that her quick,
feminine perception had not deceived her, and that it was indeed caused
by a running man.
