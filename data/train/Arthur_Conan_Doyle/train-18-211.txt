The sun blazed down with a degree of heat which was remarkable so late
in the season, and a shimmering haze lay upon the upland moors and
concealed the Irish mountains on the other side of the Channel. The sea itself rose and fell in a long, heavy, oily roll, sweeping
slowly landward, and breaking sullenly with a dull, monotonous booming
upon the rock-girt shore. To the inexperienced all seemed calm and
peaceful, but to those who are accustomed to read Nature's warnings
there was a dark menace in air and sky and sea.
