Through such country did the party ride for eight or it might be nine
miles, until the sun began to slope down in the west and their shadows
to stream down the road in front of them. Wary and careful they must
be, with watchful eyes to the right and the left, for this was no man's
land, and their only passports were those which hung from their belts.
Frenchmen and Englishmen, Gascon and Provencal, Brabanter, Tardvenu,
Scorcher, Flayer, and Free Companion, wandered and struggled over the
whole of this accursed district. So bare and cheerless was the outlook,
and so few and poor the dwellings, that Sir Nigel began to have fears as
to whether he might find food and quarters for his little troop. It was
a relief to him, therefore, when their narrow track opened out upon a
larger road, and they saw some little way down it a square white house
with a great bunch of holly hung out at the end of a stick from one of
the upper windows.
