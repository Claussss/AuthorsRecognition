I looked through the gate and saw that it was indeed the general, who,
having either seen us or been attracted by our voices, was hurrying down
towards us. As he advanced he would stop from time to time and peer at
us through the dark shadow thrown by the trees, as if he were irresolute
whether to come on or no. “He's reconnoitering!” whispered my companion with a hoarse chuckle.
“He's afraid--and I know what he's afraid of. He won't be caught in a
trap if he can help it, the old 'un. He's about as fly as they make 'em,
you bet!”
