     "It is not altogether a sombre journey he makes among the shadows,
     but apparently one of happy, as well as tender experiences, so that

     flippancy--Sir Arthur, the whole time, exhibited that attitude of
     reverence and humility demanded of one traversing a domain on the
     borderland of the tremendous. Nothing approaching a theatrical

     was for the most part a plain statement. First things had to be
     said, and the explanatory groundwork laid for future development.
     It was a lucid, illuminating introduction."
