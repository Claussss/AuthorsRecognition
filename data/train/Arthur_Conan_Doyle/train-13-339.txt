      “‘Such, in a few words, my dear boy, is the history of this
      terrible business in which I was involved. Next day we were
      picked up by the brig _Hotspur_, bound for Australia, whose
      captain found no difficulty in believing that we were the
      survivors of a passenger ship which had foundered. The transport
      ship _Gloria Scott_ was set down by the Admiralty as being lost
      at sea, and no word has ever leaked out as to her true fate.
      After an excellent voyage the _Hotspur_ landed us at Sydney,
      where Evans and I changed our names and made our way to the
      diggings, where, among the crowds who were gathered from all
      nations, we had no difficulty in losing our former identities.
