Note J.--Battle of Sedgemoor. A curious little sidelight upon the battle is afforded by the two
following letters exhibited to the Royal Archaeological Institute by the
Rev. C. W. Bingham. ‘To Mrs. Chaffin at Chettle House.’ ‘Monday, about ye forenoon, July 6, 1685.’ ‘My dearest creature,--This morning about one o’clock the rebbells fell
upon us whilest we were in our tents in King’s Sedgemoor, with their
whole army.... We have killed and taken at least 1000 of them. They are
fled into Bridgewater. It is said that we have taken all their cannon,
but sure it is that most are, if all be not. A coat with stars on ‘t is
taken. ‘’Tis run through the back. By some ‘tis thought that the Duke
rebbell had it on and is killed, but most doe think that a servant wore
it. I wish he were called, that the wars may be ended. It’s thought
he’ll never be able to make his men fight again. I thank God I am very
well without the least hurt, soe are our Dorsetshire friends. Prythee
let Biddy know this by the first opportunity. I am thyne onely deare,
TOSSEY.’
