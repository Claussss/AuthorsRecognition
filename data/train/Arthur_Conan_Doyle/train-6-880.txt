“It is his Squire, William of Montaubon,” Calverly answered. “And there
are the golden lion of Rochefort and the silver cross of Du Bois the
Strong. I would not wish to meet a better company than are before us
this day. See, there are the blue rings of young Tintiniac, who slew
my Squire Hubert last Lammastide. With the aid of Saint George I will
avenge him ere nightfall.” “By the three kings of Almain,” growled Croquart, “we will need to fight
hard this day, for never have I seen so many good soldiers gathered
together. Yonder is Yves Cheruel, whom they call the man of iron, Caro
de Bodegat also with whom I have had more than one bickering--that is
he with the three ermine circles on the scarlet shield. There too is
left-handed Alain de Karanais; bear in mind that his stroke comes on the
side where there is no shield.”
