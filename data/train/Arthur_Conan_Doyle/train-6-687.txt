ways of it. No man-servant ever slept beneath your roof, for you feared

shout, if it so please you. It chanced that I was passing on my way from
England in those ships which lie off La Brechou, and I thought I would
come in and have speech with you.” “Indeed, Simon, I am right glad to see you,” said the King, cringing
away from the fierce eyes of the soldier. “We were good friends in the
past, were we not, and I cannot call to mind that I have ever done you
injury. When you made your way to England by swimming to the Levantine
there was none more glad in heart than I!”
