The movement which is destined to bring vitality to the dead and cold
religions has been called "Modern Spiritualism."  The "modern" is good,
since the thing itself, in one form or another, is as old as history,
and has always, however obscured by forms, been the red central glow in
the depths of all religious ideas, permeating the Bible from end to
end.  But the word "Spiritualism" has been so befouled by wicked
charlatans, and so cheapened by many a sad incident, that one could
almost wish that some such term as "psychic religion" would clear the
subject of old prejudices, just as mesmerism, after many years of
obloquy, was rapidly accepted when its name was changed to hypnotism.
On the other hand, one remembers the sturdy pioneers who have fought
under this banner, and who were prepared to risk their careers, their
professional success, and even their reputation for sanity, by publicly
asserting what they knew to be the truth.
