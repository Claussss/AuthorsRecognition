our way over the ditch. Then we will beat in the gates and so win a
footing.” The young Frenchman had come with Nigel to the conference, and now, amid
the silence which followed the leader's proposal, he asked if he might
be heard. He was clad in the brazen armor which Nigel had taken from the
Red Ferret. “It may be that it is not for me to join in your counsel,” said he,
“seeing that I am a prisoner and a Frenchman. But this man is the enemy
of all, and we of France owe him a debt even as you do, since many a
good Frenchman has died in his cellars. For this reason I crave to be
heard.”
