“Oh, don't, Mr. Stephens!” cried the girl. “I won't, if it is very painful to you. As I said, it would make me die
happier, but I don't want to be selfish about it. If I thought it would
darken your life afterwards or be a sad recollection to you I would not
say another word.” “What did you wish to say?” “It was only to tell you how I loved you. I always loved you. From the
first I was a different man when I was with you. But of course it was
absurd, I knew that well enough. I never said anything, and I tried not
to make myself ridiculous. But I just want you to know about it now that
it can't matter one way or the other. You'll understand that I really
do love you when I tell you that, if it were not that I knew you were
frightened and unhappy, these last two days in which we have been always
together would have been infinitely the happiest of my life.”
