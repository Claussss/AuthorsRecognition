(1) The old rascal was well paid for his trouble, so he need not have
made such a favour of it.--J.F.W. CHAPTER IX. NARRATIVE OF JOHN EASTERLING, F.R.C.P.EDIN. 
Having given the statement of Israel Stakes _in extenso_, I shall append
a short memorandum from Dr. Easterling, now practising at Stranraer.
It is true that the doctor was only once within the walls of Cloomber
during its tenancy by General Heatherstone, but there were some
circumstances connected with this visit which made it valuable,
especially when considered as a supplement to the experiences which I
have just submitted to the reader.
