      “I claim your sympathy, then, in my investigation of Mr.
      Staunton’s fate. Do you know where he is?”       “Certainly not.”       “You have not seen him since yesterday?”       “No, I have not.”       “Was Mr. Staunton a healthy man?”       “Absolutely.”       “Did you ever know him ill?”       “Never.”       Holmes popped a sheet of paper before the doctor’s eyes. “Then
      perhaps you will explain this receipted bill for thirteen
      guineas, paid by Mr. Godfrey Staunton last month to Dr. Leslie
      Armstrong, of Cambridge. I picked it out from among the papers
      upon his desk.”
