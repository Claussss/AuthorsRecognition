      “Kindly let me have the facts, Mr. Munro,” said Holmes, with some
      impatience.       “I’ll tell you what I know about Effie’s history. She was a widow
      when I met her first, though quite young—only twenty-five. Her
      name then was Mrs. Hebron. She went out to America when she was
      young, and lived in the town of Atlanta, where she married this
      Hebron, who was a lawyer with a good practice. They had one
      child, but the yellow fever broke out badly in the place, and
      both husband and child died of it. I have seen his death
      certificate. This sickened her of America, and she came back to
      live with a maiden aunt at Pinner, in Middlesex. I may mention
      that her husband had left her comfortably off, and that she had a
      capital of about four thousand five hundred pounds, which had
      been so well invested by him that it returned an average of seven
      per cent. She had only been six months at Pinner when I met her;
      we fell in love with each other, and we married a few weeks
      afterwards.
