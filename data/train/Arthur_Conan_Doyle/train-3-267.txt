I should have thought that my answer was conclusive, and would have
elicited some sort of apology; but instead of this, _The Press_ called
loudly upon me in a leading article to apologise, though for what I know
not, save that they asserted I had said "some years," whereas I claim
that I actually said "some time." This drew the following rather more
severe letter from me:      "SIR,--_I am collecting New Zealand curiosities, so I will take
     your leading article home with me. To get the full humour of it one
     has to remember the sequence of events. In a leading article you
     remarked that Professor Hyslop is Professor of Logic. I answered
     with mild irony that he certainly is not, as he had been dead 'some
     years' or 'some time'--which of the two is perfectly immaterial,
     since I presume that in either case you would agree that he has
     ceased to be Professor of Logic. To this you were rash enough to
     reply with a challenging article with large head-lines, declaring
     that I had blundered, and that this was typical of the inaccuracy
     of Spiritualists. I wrote a gentle remonstrance to show that I had
     not blundered, and that my assertion was essentially true, since
     the man was dead. This you now tacitly admit, but instead of
     expressing regret you ask for an apology from me. I have engaged
     in much newspaper controversy, but I can truly say that I can
     recall no such instance of effrontery as this._"
