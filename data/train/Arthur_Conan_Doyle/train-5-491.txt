chair and shouted, but, indeed, were it not that he still remained in

had shredded off in an instant, and the room looked like a barber's
shop on a Saturday night.  There he sat, his eyes still shining, his
skin radiant with the glow of perfect health, but with a scalp as bald
as a Dutch cheese, and a chin without so much as a trace of down.  He
began to revolve one of his arms, slowly and doubtfully at first, but
with more confidence as he went on.
