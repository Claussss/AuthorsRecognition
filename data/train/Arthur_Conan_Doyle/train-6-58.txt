“Keep your bolts for your weasels!” said he. “Would you take life from a
creature whose only fault is that its spirit is so high that it has
met none yet who dare control it? You would slay such a horse as a king
might be proud to mount, and all because a country franklin, or a monk,
or a monk's varlet, has not the wit nor the hands to master him?” The sacrist turned swiftly on the Squire. “The Abbey owes you an
offering for this day's work, however rude your words may be,” said he.
“If you think so much of the horse, you may desire to own it. If I am to
pay for it, then with the holy Abbot's permission it is in my gift and I
bestow it freely upon you.”
