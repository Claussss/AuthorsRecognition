directing the attack from the poop when the shipman rushed wildly up to
him with fear on his face. “Sire!” he cried. “The ship may not stand against these blows. A few

and two brawny arms swept downward. A great slug, whizzing down, beat
a gaping hole in the deck, and fell rending and riving into the hold
below. The master-mariner tore his grizzled hair.
