“I ask only one thing, and I have come hither that I may get it. It is
that you pay me forfeit for that you have lost your wager.” “My wager, Simon! I call to mind no wager.” “But I will call it to your mind, and then I will take my payment. Often
have you sworn that you would break my courage. 'By my head!' you have
cried to me. 'You will crawl at my feet!' and again: 'I will wager my
head that I will tame you!' Yes, yes, a score of times you have said so.
In my heart, as I listened, I have taken up your gage. And now, dog, you
have lost and I am here to claim the forfeit.”
