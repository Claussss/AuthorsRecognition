March 26.  Wilson was, as I had anticipated, very exultant over my
conversion, and Miss Penclosa was also demurely pleased at the result
of her experiment.  Strange what a silent, colorless creature she is
save only when she exercises her power!  Even talking about it gives
her color and life.  She seems to take a singular interest in me.  I
cannot help observing how her eyes follow me about the room.
