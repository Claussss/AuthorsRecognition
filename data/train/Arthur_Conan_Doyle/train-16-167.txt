A small square metal receptacle was connected by numerous wires to a
broad steel girdle, furnished on either side with two powerful

short arms attached to them flashed round every few seconds, with a
pause between each rhythmic turn. The power which moved them came
evidently from the metal box. A subtle odour of ozone was in the air.
