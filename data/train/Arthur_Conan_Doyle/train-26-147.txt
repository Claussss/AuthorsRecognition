What a wonderful description and example of style! And how vivid
is the impression left by such expressions as "all the pages in a
breeze." As a comment on Carlyle, and as a sample of Meredith, the
passage is equally perfect. Well, "Richard Feverel" has come into its own at last. I confess to
having a strong belief in the critical discernment of the public. I
do not think good work is often overlooked. Literature, like water,
finds its true level. Opinion is slow to form, but it sets true at
last. I am sure that if the critics were to unite to praise a bad
book or to damn a good one they could (and continually do) have
a five-year influence, but it would in no wise affect the final
result. Sheridan said that if all the fleas in his bed had been
unanimous, they could have pushed him out of it. I do not think
that any unanimity of critics has ever pushed a good book out of
literature.
