      “I have a good mind to go to London with you,” said the baronet.
      “Why should I stay here alone?”       “Because it is your post of duty. Because you gave me your word
      that you would do as you were told, and I tell you to stay.”       “All right, then, I’ll stay.”       “One more direction! I wish you to drive to Merripit House. Send
      back your trap, however, and let them know that you intend to
      walk home.”
