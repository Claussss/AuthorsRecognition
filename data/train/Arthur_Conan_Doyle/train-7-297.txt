The Arabs had halted for an instant, as if uncertain whether they should
delay their journey to pursue them or not. There was nothing left to
pursue now, for amid the undulations of the sand-drift the vedettes
might have gone in any direction. The Emir galloped back along the line,
with exhortations and orders. Then the camels began to trot, and the
hopes of the prisoners were dulled by the agonies of the terrible jolt.
Mile after mile and mile after mile they sped onwards over that vast
expanse, the women clinging as best they might to the pommels, the
Colonel almost as spent as they, but still keenly on the lookout for any
sign of the pursuers.
