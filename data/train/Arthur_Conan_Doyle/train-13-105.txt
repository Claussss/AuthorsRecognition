      It was a small shed in the narrow garden which ran behind the
      house. Lestrade went in and brought out a yellow cardboard box,
      with a piece of brown paper and some string. There was a bench at
      the end of the path, and we all sat down while Holmes examined,
      one by one, the articles which Lestrade had handed to him.       “The string is exceedingly interesting,” he remarked, holding it
      up to the light and sniffing at it. “What do you make of this
      string, Lestrade?”
