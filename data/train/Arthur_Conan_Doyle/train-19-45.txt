March 27.  A blank day, as Miss Penclosa goes with Wilson and his wife
to the Suttons'.  Have begun Binet and Ferre's "Animal Magnetism."
What strange, deep waters these are!  Results, results, results--and
the cause an absolute mystery.  It is stimulating to the imagination,
but I must be on my guard against that.  Let us have no inferences nor
deductions, and nothing but solid facts.  I KNOW that the mesmeric
trance is true; I KNOW that mesmeric suggestion is true; I KNOW that I
am myself sensitive to this force.  That is my present position.  I
have a large new note-book which shall be devoted entirely to
scientific detail.
