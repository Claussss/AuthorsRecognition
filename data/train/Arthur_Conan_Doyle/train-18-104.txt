“My good fellow,” said the general, in a not unkindly tone, “you don't
know what you are asking for. There is a gulf between you and any one of
the blood of Heatherstone which can never be bridged over.” All trace of anger had vanished now from his manner, and given place to
an air of somewhat contemptuous amusement. My family pride took fire at his words. “The gulf may be less than you
imagine,” I said coldly. “We are not clodhoppers because we live in this
out-of-the-way place. I am of noble descent on one side, and my mother
was a Buchan of Buchan. I assure you that there is no such disparity
between us as you seem to imagine.”
