How often he had longed for this day! And now it had come with no shadow
cast behind it. Dame Ermyntrude was under the King's protection. The old
servants had their future assured. The strife with the monks of Waverley
had been assuaged. He had a noble horse under him, the best of weapons,
and a stout follower at his back. Above all he was bound on a gallant
errand with the bravest knight in England as his leader. All these
thoughts surged together in his mind, and he whistled and sang, as he
rode, out of the joy of his heart, while Pommers sidled and curveted in
sympathy with the mood of his master. Presently, glancing back, he
saw from Aylward's downcast eyes and Puckered brow that the archer was
clouded with trouble. He reined his horse to let him come abreast of
him.
