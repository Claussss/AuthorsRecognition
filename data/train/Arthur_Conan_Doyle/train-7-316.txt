“Any other Englishman with you?” “Archer is with the flanking party.
He'll have to come past, for I don't think there is any other way
down. We've got one of your chaps up there--a funny old bird with a
red topknot. See you later, I hope! Good day, ladies!” He touched his
helmet, tapped his camel, and trotted on after his men. “We can't do better than stay where we are until they are all past,”
 said the Colonel, for it was evident now that the men from above would
have to come round. In a broken single file they went past, black men
and brown, Soudanese and fellaheen, but all of the best, for the Camel
Corps is the _corps d'elite_ of the Egyptian army. Each had a brown
bandolier over his chest and his rifle held across his thigh. A large
man with a drooping black moustache and a pair of binoculars in his hand
was riding at the side of them.
