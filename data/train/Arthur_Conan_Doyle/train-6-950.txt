A buzz of joyful assent arose from the meeting, and even from the
attendant men-at-arms who guarded the door. When it had died away the
Duke of Orleans rose in his place beside the King. “Sire,” said he, “you speak as we would have you do, and I for one am of
opinion that the Cardinal of Perigord has been an ill friend of France,
for why should we bargain for a part when we have but to hold out our
hand in order to grasp the whole? What need is there for words? Let us
spring to horse forthwith and ride over this handful of marauders who
have dared to lay waste your fair dominions. If one of them go hence
save as our prisoner we are the more to blame.”
