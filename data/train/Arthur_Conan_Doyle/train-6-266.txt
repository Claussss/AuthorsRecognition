“Because I hope to show you better sport ere you come to Tilford.” “For the hawk? For the hound?” “A nobler sport than either.” “Is this a riddle, John? What mean you?” “Nay, to tell all would be to spoil all. I say again that there is rare
sport betwixt here and Tilford, and I beg you, dear lord, to mend your
pace that we make the most of the daylight.” Thus adjured, the King set spurs to his horse, and the whole cavalcade
cantered over the heath in the direction which Chandos showed. Presently
as they came over a slope they saw beneath them a winding river with
an old high-backed bridge across it. On the farther side was a village
green with a fringe of cottages and one dark manor house upon the side
of the hill.
