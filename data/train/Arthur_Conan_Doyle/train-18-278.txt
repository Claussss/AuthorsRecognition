The wagonette had just finished loading up when we arrived, and the
chief places, on either side of the driver, had been reserved for my two
companions, who speedily sprang into them. With a chorus of cheers the
good fellows whirled away down the road, while my father, Esther, and I
stood upon the lawn and waved our hands to them until they disappeared
behind the Cloomber woods, _en route_ for the Wigtown railway station.
Barque and crew had both vanished now from our little world, the only
relic of either being the heaps of _debris_ upon the beach, which were
to lie there until the arrival of an agent from Lloyd's.
