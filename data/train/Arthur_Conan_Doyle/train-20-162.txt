      So, indeed, it proved, and as I come to the dark conclusion of a
      story which had seemed to me to be only childish and bizarre, I
      experience once again the dismay and horror with which I was
      filled. Would that I had some brighter ending to communicate to
      my readers, but these are the chronicles of fact, and I must
      follow to their dark crisis the strange chain of events which for
      some days made Riding Thorpe Manor a household word through the
      length and breadth of England.
