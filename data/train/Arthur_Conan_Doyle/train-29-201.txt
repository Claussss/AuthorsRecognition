“And how did you verify them?” “Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew
the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed

the firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it answered

his business address asking him if he would come here. As I expected,

characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from
Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description
tallied in every respect with that of their employé, James Windibank.
