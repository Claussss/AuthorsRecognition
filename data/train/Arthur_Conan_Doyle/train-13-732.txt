      of manner, “you must stay where you are all day. Let nothing
      prevent you from staying where you are all day. It is of the
      utmost importance.”       “Certainly, if you wish it, Mr. Holmes,” said the girl in
      astonishment.       “When you go to bed lock the door of this room on the outside and
      keep the key. Promise to do this.”
