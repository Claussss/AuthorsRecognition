      “Ah, Mr. Holmes,” said he, heartily, as my friend entered, “I am
      delighted to see you.”       “Good-morning, Lanner,” answered Holmes; “you won’t think me an
      intruder, I am sure. Have you heard of the events which led up to
      this affair?”       “Yes, I heard something of them.”       “Have you formed any opinion?”       “As far as I can see, the man has been driven out of his senses
      by fright. The bed has been well slept in, you see. There’s his
      impression deep enough. It’s about five in the morning, you know,
      that suicides are most common. That would be about his time for
      hanging himself. It seems to have been a very deliberate affair.”
