However, all this has nothing to do with what I took up my stylus to
tell you. No doubt it is the common gossip of the forum and of the baths
how our army, excellently handled by the princely Titus, carried one
line of wall after the other until we had only the temple before us.
This, however, is--or was, for I see it burning even as I write--a very
strong fortress. Romans have no idea of the magnificence of this place.
The temple of which I speak is a far finer building than any we have in
Rome, and so is the Palace, built by Herod or Agrippa, I really forget
which. This temple is two hundred paces each way, with stones so fitted
that the blade of a knife will not go between, and the soldiers say
there is gold enough within to fill the pockets of the whole army. This
idea puts some fury into the attack, as you can believe, but with these
flames I fear a great deal of the plunder will be lost.
