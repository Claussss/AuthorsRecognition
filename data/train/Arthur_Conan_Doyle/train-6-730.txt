There was a comradeship among men of gentle blood and bearing which
banded them together against all ruffianly or unchivalrous attack. These
rude fellows were no soldiers. Their dress and arms, their uncouth cries
and wild assault, marked them as banditti--such men as had slain the
Englishman upon the road. Waiting in narrow gorges with a hidden rope
across the path, they watched for the lonely horseman as a fowler waits
by his bird-trap, trusting that they could overthrow the steed and then
slay the rider ere he had recovered from his fall.
