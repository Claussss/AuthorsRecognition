      “Naturally, the coachman’s first thought, on finding that he
      could do nothing for his master, was to open the door. But here
      an unexpected and singular difficulty presented itself. The key
      was not in the inner side of the door, nor could he find it
      anywhere in the room. He went out again, therefore, through the
      window, and having obtained the help of a policeman and of a
      medical man, he returned. The lady, against whom naturally the
      strongest suspicion rested, was removed to her room, still in a
      state of insensibility. The Colonel’s body was then placed upon
      the sofa, and a careful examination made of the scene of the
      tragedy.
