leaned with her hand upon his shoulder. Her pale face looked past
him, and it was some new light in her eyes, a flash of expectancy, of
triumph, of wicked joy, which gave him sudden warning of his danger. He shook her off and sprang to one side, but only just in time to avoid
a crashing blow from a great club in the hands of a man even taller
and stronger than himself. He had one quick vision of great white teeth
clenched in grim ferocity, a wild flying beard and blazing wild-beast
eyes. The next instant he had closed, ducking his head beneath another
swing of that murderous cudgel.
