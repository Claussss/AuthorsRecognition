"Stay here," said he. "I will be with you again." With a swift rustle of
his silken robes he swept from the chamber. A few minutes had elapsed when a curtain at the end of the room was
pushed aside, and the eunuch, reappearing, held it back, doubling his
unwieldy body into a profound obeisance as he did so. Through the gap
came a small alert woman, clad in golden tissue, with a loose outer
mantle and shoes of the Imperial purple. That colour alone showed that
she could be none other than the Empress; but the dignity of her
carriage, the fierce authority of her magnificent dark eyes, and the
perfect beauty of her haughty face, all proclaimed that it could only be
that of Theodora who, in spite of her lowly origin, was the most
majestic as well as the most maturely lovely of all the women in her
kingdom. Gone now were the buffoon tricks which the daughter of Acacius
the bearward had learned in the amphitheatre; gone too was the light
charm of the wanton, and what was left was the worthy mate of a great
king, the measured dignity of one who was every inch an empress.
