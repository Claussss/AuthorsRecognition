valley, “there appear to be some very worthy people among them. What is
this golden banner which waves upon the left?” “It is the ensign of the Knights of Calatrava,” answered Felton. “And the other upon the right?” “It marks the Knights of Santiago, and I see by his flag that their
grand-master rides at their head. There too is the banner of Castile
amid yonder sparkling squadron which heads the main battle. There are
six thousand men-at-arms with ten squadrons of slingers as far as I may
judge their numbers.”
