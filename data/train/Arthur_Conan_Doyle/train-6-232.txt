Meanwhile the Squire and the armorer sat with their heads touching and
the old suit of mail with its gorget of overlapping plates laid out
across their knees. Again and again old Wat shrugged his shoulders, as
one who has been asked to do more than can be demanded from mortal man.
At last, at a suggestion from the Squire, he leaned back in his
chair and laughed long and loudly in his bushy beard, while the Lady
Ermyntrude glared her black displeasure at such plebeian merriment.
Then taking his fine chisel and his hammer from his pouch of tools,
the armorer, still chuckling at his own thoughts, began to drive a hole
through the center of the steel tunic.
