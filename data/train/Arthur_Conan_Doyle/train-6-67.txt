as faster and still more fast the frantic horse bore himself and his
rider toward the wall. Would Nigel spring off? To do so would be to bend
his will to that of the beast beneath him. There was a better way than

bridle into the left hand which still held the mane. Then with the right
he slipped his short mantle from his shoulders and lying forward along
the creature's strenuous, rippling back he cast the flapping cloth over
the horse's eyes.
