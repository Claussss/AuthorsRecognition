Sir Walter Woodland, riding a high black horse, took station by the
Prince, with the royal banner resting in a socket by his saddle. From
all sides the knights and squires crowded in upon it, until they formed
a great squadron containing the survivors of the battalions of Warwick
and Salisbury as well as those of the Prince. Four hundred men-at-arms
who had been held in reserve were brought up and thickened the array,
but even so Chandos' face was grave as he scanned it and then turned his
eyes upon the masses of the Frenchmen.
