But the most interesting portion of old Froissart's work is that
which deals with the knights and the knight-errants of his time,
their deeds, their habits, their methods of talking. It is true that
he lived himself just a little after the true heyday of chivalry;
but he was quite early enough to have met many of the men who had
been looked upon as the flower of knighthood of the time. His book
was read too, and commented on by these very men (as many of them as
could read), and so we may take it that it was no fancy portrait,
but a correct picture of these soldiers which is to be found in it.
The accounts are always consistent. If you collate the remarks and
speeches of the knights (as I have had occasion to do) you will find
a remarkable uniformity running through them. We may believe then
that this really does represent the kind of men who fought at Crecy
and at Poictiers, in the age when both the French and the Scottish
kings were prisoners in London, and England reached a pitch of
military glory which has perhaps never been equalled in her history.
