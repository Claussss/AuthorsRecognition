honor in this country, for I have ever heard that the English are very
hardy men and excellent people to fight with. My mules and my baggage
are at Evran; but I rode forth to see what I could see, and I chanced
upon your army moving down the road, so I coasted it in the hopes of
some profit or adventure. Then you came after me and I would have given
all the gold goblets upon my father's table if I had my harness so that
I could have turned upon you. I have promised the Countess Beatrice that
I will send her an Englishman or two to kiss her hands.”
