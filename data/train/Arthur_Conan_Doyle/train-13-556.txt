      “Good-evening, Mr. Holmes,” said he. “I am sure I am very much
      obliged to you for coming round. No one ever needed your advice
      more than I do. I suppose that Dr. Trevelyan has told you of this
      most unwarrantable intrusion into my rooms.”       “Quite so,” said Holmes. “Who are these two men Mr. Blessington,
      and why do they wish to molest you?”       “Well, well,” said the resident patient, in a nervous fashion,
      “of course it is hard to say that. You can hardly expect me to
      answer that, Mr. Holmes.”
