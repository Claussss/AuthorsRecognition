"No hurry.  Light your pipe again." "Not I.  I'm supposed to be in training.  Here I've been sitting
gossiping when I ought to have been safely tucked up.  I'll borrow your
skull, if you can share it.  Williams has had mine for a month.  I'll
take the little bones of your ear, too, if you are sure you won't need
them.  Thanks very much.  Never mind a bag, I can carry them very well
under my arm.  Good-night, my son, and take my tip as to your
neighbour."
