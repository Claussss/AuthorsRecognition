â€œI was hanging on the side of the table when Barker came hurrying down.
I heard my wife coming, and I ran to the door and stopped her. It was no
sight for a woman. I promised I'd come to her soon. I said a word or two
to Barker--he took it all in at a glance--and we waited for the rest to
come along. But there was no sign of them. Then we understood that they
could hear nothing, and that all that had happened was known only to
ourselves.
