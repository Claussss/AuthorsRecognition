“Which of them?” asked Sir Nigel. “Ha, ha!” cried the pardoner, shaking a jewelled forefinger. “Thou
wouldst be deep in the secrets of mother Church? Know then that I have
both in my scrip. Those who hold with Urban shall have Urban's pardon,
while I have Clement's for the Clementist--or he who is in doubt may
have both, so that come what may he shall be secure. I pray you that you
will buy one, for war is bloody work, and the end is sudden with little
time for thought or shrift. Or you, sir, for you seem to me to be a man
who would do ill to trust to your own merits.” This to the alderman of
Norwich, who had listened to him with a frowning brow and a sneering
lip.
