Our visitor sniggered. “You do. You are, fortunately, the only man in London who does. Do you
know what is the matter with you?” “The same,” said Holmes. “Ah! You recognise the symptoms?” “Only too well.” “Well, I shouldn’t be surprised, Holmes. I shouldn’t be surprised if it
_were_ the same. A bad lookout for you if it is. Poor Victor was a dead
man on the fourth day—a strong, hearty young fellow. It was certainly,
as you said, very surprising that he should have contracted an
out-of-the-way Asiatic disease in the heart of London—a disease, too,
of which I had made such a very special study. Singular coincidence,
Holmes. Very smart of you to notice it, but rather uncharitable to
suggest that it was cause and effect.”
