Sir Tristram de Rochefort, Seneschal of Auvergne and Lord of
Villefranche, was a fierce and renowned soldier who had grown gray in
the English wars. As lord of the marches and guardian of an exposed
country-side, there was little rest for him even in times of so-called
peace, and his whole life was spent in raids and outfalls upon the
Brabanters, late-comers, flayers, free companions, and roving archers
who wandered over his province. At times he would come back in triumph,
and a dozen corpses swinging from the summit of his keep would warn
evil-doers that there was still a law in the land. At others his
ventures were not so happy, and he and his troop would spur it over
the drawbridge with clatter of hoofs hard at their heels and whistle of
arrows about their ears. Hard he was of hand and harder of heart, hated
by his foes, and yet not loved by those whom he protected, for twice he
had been taken prisoner, and twice his ransom had been wrung by dint
of blows and tortures out of the starving peasants and ruined farmers.
Wolves or watch-dogs, it was hard to say from which the sheep had most
to fear.
