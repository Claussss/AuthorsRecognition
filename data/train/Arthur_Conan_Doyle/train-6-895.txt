But the opening of this second phase of the combat brought one great
misfortune and discouragement to the English. Bambro' like the others,
had undone his visor, but with his mind full of many cares he had
neglected to make it fast again. There was an opening an inch broad
betwixt it and the beaver. As the two lines met the left-handed Breton
squire, Alain de Karanais, caught sight of Bambro's face, and in an
instant thrust his short spear through the opening. The English leader
gave a cry of pain and fell on his knees, but staggered to his feet
again, too weak to raise his shield. As he stood exposed the Breton
knight, Geoffrey Dubois the Strong, struck him such a blow with his
ax that he beat in the whole breast-plate with the breast behind it.
Bambro' fell dead upon the ground and for a few minutes a fierce fight
raged round his body.
