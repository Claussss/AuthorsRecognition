Warner had been wanted by the law, and by nobody else, for many years.
Desperado, murderer, train robber and road agent, he was a man beyond
the pale of human pity.  He had deserved a dozen deaths, and the Los
Amigos folk grudged him so gaudy a one as that.  He seemed to feel
himself to be unworthy of it, for he made two frenzied attempts at
escape.  He was a powerful, muscular man, with a lion head, tangled
black locks, and a sweeping beard which covered his broad chest.  When
he was tried, there was no finer head in all the crowded court.  It's
no new thing to find the best face looking from the dock.  But his good
looks could not balance his bad deeds.  His advocate did all he knew,
but the cards lay against him, and Duncan Warner was handed over to the
mercy of the big Los Amigos dynamos.
