      ELSIE-PREPARE-TO-MEET-THY-GOD       Holmes bent over this grotesque frieze for some minutes, and then
      suddenly sprang to his feet with an exclamation of surprise and
      dismay. His face was haggard with anxiety.       “We have let this affair go far enough,” said he. “Is there a
      train to North Walsham to-night?”       I turned up the time-table. The last had just gone.       “Then we shall breakfast early and take the very first in the
      morning,” said Holmes. “Our presence is most urgently needed. Ah!
      here is our expected cablegram. One moment, Mrs. Hudson, there
      may be an answer. No, that is quite as I expected. This message
      makes it even more essential that we should not lose an hour in
      letting Hilton Cubitt know how matters stand, for it is a
      singular and a dangerous web in which our simple Norfolk squire
      is entangled.”
