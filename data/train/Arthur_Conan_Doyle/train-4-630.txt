          “Our money shall never indite us
           Or drag us to Goldsmith Hall,
           No pirates or wrecks can affright us.
           We that have no estates
           Fear no plunder or rates,
           Nor care to lock gates.
           He that lies on the ground cannot fall!” That last would make a good motto for an almshouse.’ ‘You will have Sir Stephen up,’ said I warningly, for he was carolling
away at the pitch of his lungs.
