The answer was the Gipsy song from "Il Trovatore," very accurately
whistled, and then a quick-step.  After the latter, the voice said:
"That is a test for father." This reproduction of conversation is not quite verbatim, but gives the
condensed essence.  Mr. Oaten at once visited Mr. Mill, who was not a
Spiritualist, and found that every detail was correct.  Young Mill had
lost his life as narrated.  Mr. Mill, senior, explained that while
sitting in his study at midnight on the date named he had heard the
Gipsy song from "Il Trovatore," which had been a favourite of his
boy's, and being unable to trace the origin of the music, had finally
thought that it was a freak of his imagination.  The test connected
with the quick-step had reference to a tune which the young man used to
play upon the piccolo, but which was so rapid that he never could get
it right, for which he was chaffed by the family.
