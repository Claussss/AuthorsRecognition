“I will not deny that there was an emeute, but it was local, you
understand, and now long forgotten. Since then there has been profound
peace in the Soudan.” “But I have heard of raids, Monsieur Fardet, and I've read of battles,
too, when the Arabs tried to invade Egypt. It was only two days ago that
we passed Toski, where the dragoman said there had been a fight. Is that
all bluff also?” “Pah, my friend, you do not know the English. You look at them as you
see them with their pipes and their contented faces, and you say, 'Now,
these are good, simple folk who will never hurt any one.' But all the
time they are thinking and watching and planning. 'Here is Egypt weak,'
they cry. '_Allons!_' and down they swoop like a gull upon a crust. 'You
have no right there,' says the world. 'Come out of it!' But England has
already begun to tidy everything, just like the good Miss Adams when she
forces her way into the house of an Arab. 'Come out,' says the world.
'Certainly,' says England; 'just wait one little minute until I have
made everything nice and proper.' So the world waits for a year or so,
and then it says once again, 'Come out.' 'Just wait a little,' says
England; 'there is trouble at Khartoum, and when I have set that all
right I shall be very glad to come out.' So they wait until it is all
over, and then again they say, 'Come out.' 'How can I come out,' says
England, 'when there are still raids and battles going on? If we were
to leave, Egypt would be run over.' 'But there are no raids,' says the
world. 'Oh, are there not?' says England, and then within a week sure
enough the papers are full of some new raid of Dervishes. We are not all
blind, Mister Headingly. We understand very well how such things can be
done. A few Bedouins, a little backsheesh, some blank cartridges, and,
behold--a raid!”
