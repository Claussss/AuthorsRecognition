“We have suffered sorely in this last bout, Wat. There are forty of our
men upon their backs, and the Dean Foresters on the right are in worse
case still.” “Talking will not mend it, Tom, and if all but one were on their backs
he must still hold his ground.” Whilst the archers were chatting, the leaders of the army were in
solemn conclave just behind them. Two divisions of the French had been
repulsed, and yet there was many an anxious face as the older knights
looked across the plain at the unbroken array of the French King
moving slowly toward them. The line of the archers was much thinned and
shredded. Many knights and squires had been disabled in the long and
fierce combat at the hedge. Others, exhausted by want of food, had no
strength left and were stretched panting upon the ground. Some were
engaged in carrying the wounded to the rear and laying them under the
shelter of the trees, whilst others were replacing their broken swords
or lances from the weapons of the slain. The Captal de Buch, brave and
experienced as he was, frowned darkly and whispered his misgivings to
Chandos.
