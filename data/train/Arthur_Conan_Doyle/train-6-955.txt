“I will advise you, sire, to the best of my power. Upon their right is a
river with marshes around it, and upon their left a great wood, so that
we can advance only upon the center. Along their front is a thick hedge,
and behind it I saw the green jerkins of their archers, as thick as the
sedges by the river. It is broken by one road where only four horsemen
could ride abreast, which leads through the position. It is clear then
that if we are to drive them back we must cross the great hedge, and
I am very sure that the horses will not face it with such a storm of
arrows beating from behind it. Therefore, it is my council that we fight
upon foot, as the English did at Crecy, for indeed we may find that our
horses will be more hindrance than help to us this day.”
