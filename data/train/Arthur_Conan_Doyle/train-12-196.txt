â€œWhen I approached the table I found, sure enough, that the bar of metal
had vanished, and that the clamp was empty. Having noted the fact, I was
about to turn away to something else, when my attention was attracted to
the fact that the table upon which the clamp stood was starred over with
little patches of some liquid silvery matter, which lay in single drops
or coalesced into little pools. I had a very distinct recollection of
having thoroughly cleared the table before beginning my experiment,
so that this substance had been deposited there since I had left for
London. Much interested, I very carefully collected it all into one
vessel, and examined it minutely. There could be no question as to what
it was. It was the purest mercury, and gave no response to any test for
bismuth.
