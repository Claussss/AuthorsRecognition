We had all listened intently to this remarkable statement.  It was
Holmes who broke the silence. "Our difficulties are not over," he remarked, shaking his head. "Our
police work ends, but our legal work begins." "Exactly," said I.  "A plausible lawyer could make it out as an act of
self-defence.  There may be a hundred crimes in the background, but it
is only on this one that they can be tried." "Come, come," said Baynes cheerily, "I think better of the law than
that.  Self-defence is one thing.  To entice a man in cold blood with
the object of murdering him is another, whatever danger you may fear
from him.  No, no, we shall all be justified when we see the tenants of
High Gable at the next Guildford Assizes."
