      “Silver Blaze,” said he, “is from the Isonomy stock, and holds as
      brilliant a record as his famous ancestor. He is now in his fifth
      year, and has brought in turn each of the prizes of the turf to
      Colonel Ross, his fortunate owner. Up to the time of the
      catastrophe he was the first favourite for the Wessex Cup, the
      betting being three to one on him. He has always, however, been a
      prime favourite with the racing public, and has never yet
      disappointed them, so that even at those odds enormous sums of
      money have been laid upon him. It is obvious, therefore, that
      there were many people who had the strongest interest in
      preventing Silver Blaze from being there at the fall of the flag
      next Tuesday.
