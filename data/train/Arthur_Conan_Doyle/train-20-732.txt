      “Dr. Leslie Armstrong is certainly a man of energy and
      character,” said he. “I have not seen a man who, if he turns his
      talents that way, was more calculated to fill the gap left by the
      illustrious Moriarty. And now, my poor Watson, here we are,
      stranded and friendless in this inhospitable town, which we
      cannot leave without abandoning our case. This little inn just
      opposite Armstrong’s house is singularly adapted to our needs. If
      you would engage a front room and purchase the necessaries for
      the night, I may have time to make a few inquiries.”
