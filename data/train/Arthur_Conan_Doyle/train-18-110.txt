He plunged into the wood and was quickly out of sight among the dense
plantation. Thus ended this extraordinary interview, in which this strange man
had begun by pointing a loaded pistol at my breast and had ended,
by partially acknowledging the possibility of my becoming his future
son-in-law. I hardly knew whether to be cast down or elated over it. On the one hand he was likely, by keeping a closer watch over his
daughter, to prevent us from communicating as freely as we had done
hitherto. Against this there was the advantage of having obtained an
implied consent to the renewal of my suit at some future date. On the
whole, I came to the conclusion as I walked thoughtfully home that I had
improved my position by the incident.
