      “There are one or two small points which I should desire to clear
      up before I go,” said he. “Your absence, Mr. Phelps, will in some
      ways rather assist me. Watson, when you reach London you would
      oblige me by driving at once to Baker Street with our friend
      here, and remaining with him until I see you again. It is
      fortunate that you are old schoolfellows, as you must have much
      to talk over. Mr. Phelps can have the spare bedroom to-night, and
      I will be with you in time for breakfast, for there is a train
      which will take me into Waterloo at eight.”
