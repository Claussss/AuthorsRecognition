round the circle, and hands were laid upon their weapons. “Not a sound, for your lives!” McMurdo whispered, as he went from the
room, closing the door carefully behind him. With strained ears the murderers waited. They counted the steps of their
comrade down the passage. Then they heard him open the outer door. There
were a few words as of greeting. Then they were aware of a strange step
inside and of an unfamiliar voice. An instant later came the slam of the
door and the turning of the key in the lock. Their prey was safe within
the trap. Tiger Cormac laughed horribly, and Boss McGinty clapped his
great hand across his mouth.
