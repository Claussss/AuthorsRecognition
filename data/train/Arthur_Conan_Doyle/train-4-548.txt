In the meanwhile the city elders, headed by our friend the Mayor,
advanced from the gate in all the dignity of silk and fur to pay homage
to the King. Sinking upon one knee by Monmouth’s stirrup, he kissed the
hand which was graciously extended to him. ‘Nay, good Master Mayor,’ said the King, in a clear, strong voice, ‘it
is for my enemies to sink before me, and not for my friends. Prythee,
what is this scroll which you do unroll?’
