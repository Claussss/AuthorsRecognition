“It is your camp,” said the Frenchman. “Nay,” said Nigel; “we have pipes with us and a naker or two, but I have
heard no trumpet-call from our ranks. It behooves us to take heed, for
we know not what may be before us. Ride this way, I pray you, that we
may look over and yet be ourselves unseen.” Some scattered boulders crowned the height, and from behind them the two
young Squires could see the long rocky valley beyond. Upon a knoll was a
small square building with a battlement round it. Some distance from it
towered a great dark castle, as massive as the rocks on which it stood,
with one strong keep at the corner, and four long lines of machicolated
walls. Above, a great banner flew proudly in the wind, with some device
which glowed red in the setting sun. Nigel shaded his eyes and stared
with wrinkled brow.
