Holmes shook his clenched hands in the air. “Incredible imbecility!” he
cried. “They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the
house with me.” “Has he come with you to-night?” “No. His orders were to stay in the house.” Again Holmes raved in the air. “Why did you come to me?” he said, “and, above all, why did you not
come at once?” “I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast
about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you.”
