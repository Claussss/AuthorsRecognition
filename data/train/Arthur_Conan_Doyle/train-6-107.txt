“What then is your errand in this house at this hour of the night?” The summoner cleared his throat pompously, and turning his parchment to
the light of the cressets he read out a long document in Norman-French,
couched in such a style and such a language that the most involved and
foolish of our forms were simplicity itself compared to those by which
the men of the long gown made a mystery of that which of all things on
earth should be the plainest and the most simple. Despair fell cold upon
Nigel's heart and blanched the face of the old dame as they listened to
the dread catalogue of claims and suits and issues, questions of peccary
and turbary, of house-bote and fire-bote, which ended by a demand for
all the lands, hereditaments, tenements, messuages and curtilages, which
made up their worldly all.
