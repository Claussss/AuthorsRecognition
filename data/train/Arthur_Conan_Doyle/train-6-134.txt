Only the sacrist stood clear. He had taken shelter behind the half-dozen
archers, who looked with some approval and a good deal of indecision at
this bold fugitive from justice. “On him!” cried the sacrist. “Shall he defy the authority of the court,
or shall one man hold six of you at bay? Close in upon him and seize
him. You, Baddlesmere, why do you hold back?” The man in question, a tall bushy-bearded fellow, clad like the others
in green jerkin and breeches with high brown boots, advanced slowly,
sword in hand, against Nigel. His heart was not in the business, for
these clerical courts were not popular, and everyone had a tender heart
for the fallen fortunes of the house of Loring and wished well to its
young heir.
