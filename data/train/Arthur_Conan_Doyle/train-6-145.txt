His dress was as noteworthy as his person. A rich purple doublet and
cloak was marked on the lapels with a strange scarlet device shaped like
a wedge. Costly lace hung round his shoulders, and amid its soft folds
there smoldered the dull red of a heavy golden chain. A knight's belt
at his waist and a knight's golden spurs twinkling from his doeskin
riding-boots proclaimed his rank, and on the wrist of his left gauntlet
there sat a demure little hooded falcon of a breed which in itself was a
mark of the dignity of the owner. Of weapons he had none, but a mandolin
was slung by a black silken band over his back, and the high brown
end projected above his shoulder. Such was the man, quaint, critical,
masterful, with a touch of what is formidable behind it, who now
surveyed the opposing groups of armed men and angry monks with an eye
which commanded their attention.
