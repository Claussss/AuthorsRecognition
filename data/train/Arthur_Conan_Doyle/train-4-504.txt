‘And how has he done so?’ I asked. ‘Why, between friends,’ quoth the Mayor, ‘it was but last Lady-day that
he asked the hand of my granddaughter Ruth in marriage. His time is
nearly served, and his father, Sam Derrick, is an honourable craftsman,
so that the match would have been no unfitting one. The maiden turned
against him, however--young girls will have their fancies--and the
matter came to an end. Yet here he dwells under the same roof-tree, at
her elbow from morn to night, with never a sign of that passion which
can scarce have died out so soon. Twice my wool warehouse hath been
nigh burned to the ground since then, and twice he hath headed those who
fought the flames. There are not many whose suit hath been rejected who
would bear themselves in so resigned and patient a fashion.’
