When his sister was gone Robert went up to his studio, and having
ground some colours upon his palette he stood for some time, brush and
mahlstick in hand, in front of his big bare canvas. But how profitless
all his work seemed to him now! What object had he in doing it? Was it
to earn money? Money could be had for the asking, or, for that matter,
without the asking. Or was it to produce a thing of beauty? But he had
artistic faults. Raffles Haw had said so, and he knew that he was right.
After all his pains the thing might not please; and with money he could
at all times buy pictures which would please, and which would be things
of beauty. What, then, was the object of his working? He could see none.
He threw down his brush, and, lighting his pipe, he strolled downstairs
once more.
