Aylward, having unstrung his bow, had remounted his horse during this
conversation, and the two rode swiftly past the little squat Chapel of
the Martyr and over the brow of the hill. From the summit they looked
back. The injured archer lay upon the ground, with several of his
comrades gathered in a knot around him. Others ran aimlessly up the
hill, but were already far behind. The leader sat motionless upon his
horse, and as he saw them look back he raised his hand and shrieked his
curses at them. An instant later the curve of the ground had hid them
from view. So, amid love and hate, Nigel bade adieu to the home of his
youth.
