cane. "Good morning!" I answered, "how beautiful the bay is looking." "Yes, Sir, but you should have seen it just before the sun rose." "What, have you been here since then?" "I was here when there was scarce light to see the path." "You are a very early riser." "On occasion, sir; on occasion!"  He cocked his eye at me as if to
gauge whether I were worthy of his confidence.  "The fact is, sir, that
my wife is coming back to me to day."
