      “‘And now I come to the most surprising part of my story, my dear
      son. The seamen had hauled the foreyard aback during the rising,
      but now as we left them they brought it square again, and as
      there was a light wind from the north and east the barque began
      to draw slowly away from us. Our boat lay, rising and falling,
      upon the long, smooth rollers, and Evans and I, who were the most
      educated of the party, were sitting in the sheets working out our
      position and planning what coast we should make for. It was a
      nice question, for the Cape de Verds were about five hundred
      miles to the north of us, and the African coast about seven
      hundred to the east. On the whole, as the wind was coming round
      to the north, we thought that Sierra Leone might be best, and
      turned our head in that direction, the barque being at that time
      nearly hull down on our starboard quarter. Suddenly as we looked
      at her we saw a dense black cloud of smoke shoot up from her,
      which hung like a monstrous tree upon the sky line. A few seconds
      later a roar like thunder burst upon our ears, and as the smoke
      thinned away there was no sign left of the _Gloria Scott_. In an
      instant we swept the boat’s head round again and pulled with all
      our strength for the place where the haze still trailing over the
      water marked the scene of this catastrophe.
