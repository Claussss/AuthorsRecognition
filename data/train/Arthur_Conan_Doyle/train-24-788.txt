CHAPTER XXVIII. HOW THE COMRADES CAME OVER THE MARCHES OF FRANCE 
After passing Cahors, the party branched away from the main road, and
leaving the river to the north of them, followed a smaller track which
wound over a vast and desolate plain. This path led them amid marshes
and woods, until it brought them out into a glade with a broad stream
swirling swiftly down the centre of it. Through this the horses splashed
their way, and on the farther shore Sir Nigel announced to them that
they were now within the borders of the land of France. For some miles
they still followed the same lonely track, which led them through
a dense wood, and then widening out, curved down to an open rolling
country, such as they had traversed between Aiguillon and Cahors.
