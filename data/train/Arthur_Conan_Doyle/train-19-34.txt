And why should I not investigate it?  I see that under yesterday's date
I said:  "If I could see something positive and objective, I might be
tempted to approach it from the physiological aspect."  Well, I have
got my test.  I shall be as good as my word.  The investigation would,
I am sure, be of immense interest.  Some of my colleagues might look
askance at it, for science is full of unreasoning prejudices, but if
Wilson has the courage of his convictions, I can afford to have it
also.  I shall go to him to-morrow morning--to him and to Miss
Penclosa.  If she can show us so much, it is probable that she can show
us more.
