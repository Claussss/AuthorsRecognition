Chandos smiled. “Things are not done in that fashion,” said he. “But my Lord Chandos,” cried the Cardinal, “I have made it clear to the
Prince that indeed it is a scandal to all Christendom and a cause of
mocking to the heathen, that two great sons of the Church should turn
their swords thus upon each other.” “Then bid the King of France keep clear of us,” said the Prince. “Fair son, you are aware that you are in the heart of his country and
that it standeth not aright that he should suffer you to go forth as you
came. You have but a small army, three thousand bowmen and five thousand
men-at-arms at the most, who seem in evil case for want of food and
rest. The King has thirty thousand men at his back, of which twenty
thousand are expert men-at-arms. It is fitting therefore that you make
such terms as you may, lest worse befall.”
