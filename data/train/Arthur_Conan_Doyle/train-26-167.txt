  "I had satisfied my curiosity at Hougoumont, and was retracing
  my steps up the hill when my attention was called to a group
  of wounded Frenchmen by the calm, dignified, and soldier-like
  oration addressed by one of them to the rest. I cannot, like
  Livy, compose a fine harangue for my hero, and, of course, I
  could not retain the precise words, but the import of them was
  to exhort them to bear their sufferings with fortitude; not
  to repine, like women or children, at what every soldier
  should have made up his mind to suffer as the fortune of
  war, but above all, to remember that they were surrounded by
  Englishmen, before whom they ought to be doubly careful not
  to disgrace themselves by displaying such an unsoldier-like
  want of fortitude.
