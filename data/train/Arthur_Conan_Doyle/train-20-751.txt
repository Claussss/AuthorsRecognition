      A woman, young and beautiful, was lying dead upon the bed. Her
      calm pale face, with dim, wide-opened blue eyes, looked upward
      from amid a great tangle of golden hair. At the foot of the bed,
      half sitting, half kneeling, his face buried in the clothes, was
      a young man, whose frame was racked by his sobs. So absorbed was
      he by his bitter grief, that he never looked up until Holmesâ€™s
      hand was on his shoulder.
