      “And so did I,” said Baskerville. “Every inch of it.”       “There was certainly no boot in it then.”       “In that case the waiter must have placed it there while we were

      matter, nor could any inquiry clear it up. Another item had been
      added to that constant and apparently purposeless series of small
      mysteries which had succeeded each other so rapidly. Setting
      aside the whole grim story of Sir Charles’s death, we had a line
      of inexplicable incidents all within the limits of two days,
      which included the receipt of the printed letter, the

      the loss of the old black boot, and now the return of the new
      brown boot. Holmes sat in silence in the cab as we drove back to
      Baker Street, and I knew from his drawn brows and keen face that

      episodes could be fitted. All afternoon and late into the evening
      he sat lost in tobacco and thought.
