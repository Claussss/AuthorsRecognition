But come into the cottage.  It's a little den of a place, but it is
pleasant to work in during the summer months." It was a small, square, white building, with green doors and shutters,
and a rustic trellis-work porch, standing back some fifty yards from
the river's bank.  Inside, the main room was roughly fitted up as a
study--deal table, unpainted shelves with books, and a few cheap
oleographs upon the wall.  A kettle sang upon a spirit-stove, and there
were tea things upon a tray on the table.
