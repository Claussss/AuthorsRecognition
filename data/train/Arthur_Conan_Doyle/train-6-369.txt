Sir John Buttesthorn was of that middle class who fared in the old
fashion, and his great oak supper-table groaned beneath the generous
pastries, the mighty joints and the great flagons. Below were the
household, above on a raised dais the family table, with places ever
ready for those frequent guests who dropped in from the high road
outside. Such a one had just come, an old priest, journeying from the
Abbey of Chertsey to the Priory of Saint John at Midhurst. He passed
often that way, and never without breaking his journey at the hospitable
board of Cosford.
