‘Poor Holloway is gone,’ said I, placing my hand over his heart. ‘Who
ever saw such a shambles? I feel sick and ill.’ ‘Here is eau-de-vie, if I mistake not,’ cried the stranger, clambering
up on a chair and reaching a bottle from the shelf. ‘Good, too, by the
smell. Take a sup, for you are as white as a new-bleached sheet.’ ‘Honest warfare I can abide, but scenes like this make my blood run
cold,’ I answered, taking a gulp from the flask. I was a very young
soldier then, my dears, but I confess that to the end of my campaigns
any form of cruelty had the same effect upon me. I give you my word that
when I went to London last fall the sight of an overworked, raw-backed
cart-horse straining with its load, and flogged for not doing that which
it could not do, gave me greater qualms than did the field of Sedgemoor,
or that greater day when ten thousand of the flower of France lay
stretched before the earthworks of Landen.
