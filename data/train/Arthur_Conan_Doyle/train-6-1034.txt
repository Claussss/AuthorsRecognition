“Did you say that you must go on your way to-morrow, father?” he asked
the priest. “Indeed, fair son, the matter presses.” “But you may bide the morning?” “It will suffice if I start at noon.” “Much may be done in a morning.” He looked at Mary, who blushed and
smiled. “By Saint Paul! I have waited long enough.” “Good, good!” chuckled the old knight, with wheezy laughter. “Even so I
wooed your mother, Mary. Wooers were brisk in the olden time. To-morrow
is Tuesday, and Tuesday is ever a lucky day. Alas! that the good Dame
Ermyntrude is no longer with us to see it done! The old hound must run
us down, Nigel, and I hear its bay upon my own heels; but my heart will
rejoice that before the end I may call you son. Give me your hand, Mary,
and yours, Nigel. Now, take an old man's blessing, and may God keep and
guard you both, and give you your desert, for I believe on my soul that
in all this broad land there dwells no nobler man nor any woman more
fitted to be his mate!”
