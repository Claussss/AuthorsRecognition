      Sherlock Holmes was a past-master in the art of putting a humble
      witness at his ease, and very soon, in the privacy of Godfrey
      Staunton’s abandoned room, he had extracted all that the porter
      had to tell. The visitor of the night before was not a gentleman,
      neither was he a workingman. He was simply what the porter
      described as a “medium-looking chap,” a man of fifty, beard
      grizzled, pale face, quietly dressed. He seemed himself to be
      agitated. The porter had observed his hand trembling when he had
      held out the note. Godfrey Staunton had crammed the note into his
      pocket. Staunton had not shaken hands with the man in the hall.
      They had exchanged a few sentences, of which the porter had only
      distinguished the one word “time.” Then they had hurried off in
      the manner described. It was just half-past ten by the hall
      clock.
