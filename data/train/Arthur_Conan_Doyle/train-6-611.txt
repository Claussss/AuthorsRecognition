The youth with an effort did so, but he was too slow in disengaging his
fingers, and the string sliding down with a snap from the upper nock
caught and pinched them sorely against the stave. A roar of laughter,
like the clap of a wave, swept down the deck as the luckless bowman
danced and wrung his hand. “Serve thee well right, thou redeless fool!” growled the old bowyer.
“So fine a bow is wasted in such hands. How now, Samkin? I can teach you
little of your trade, I trow. Here is a bow dressed as it should be; but
it would, as you say, be the better for a white band to mark the true
nocking point in the center of this red wrapping of silk. Leave it and I
will tend to it anon. And you, Wat? A fresh head on yonder stele?
Lord, that a man should carry four trades under one hat, and be bowyer,
fletcher, stringer and headmaker! Four men's work for old Bartholomew
and one man's pay!”
