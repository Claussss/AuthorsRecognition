      “Well, I don’t know now whether it was pure devilry on the part
      of this woman, or whether she thought that she could turn me
      against my wife by encouraging her to misbehave. Anyway, she took
      a house just two streets off and let lodgings to sailors.
      Fairbairn used to stay there, and Mary would go round to have tea
      with her sister and him. How often she went I don’t know, but I
      followed her one day, and as I broke in at the door Fairbairn got
      away over the back garden wall, like the cowardly skunk that he
      was. I swore to my wife that I would kill her if I found her in
      his company again, and I led her back with me, sobbing and
      trembling, and as white as a piece of paper. There was no trace
      of love between us any longer. I could see that she hated me and
      feared me, and when the thought of it drove me to drink, then she
      despised me as well.
