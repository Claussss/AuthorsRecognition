It was the more to his credit that he should keep up to date in his
knowledge, since he had no competition to force him to exertion.  In
the seven years during which he had practised in Hoyland three rivals
had pitted themselves against him, two in the village itself and one in
the neighbouring hamlet of Lower Hoyland.  Of these one had sickened
and wasted, being, as it was said, himself the only patient whom he had
treated during his eighteen months of ruralising.  A second had bought
a fourth share of a Basingstoke practice, and had departed honourably,
while a third had vanished one September night, leaving a gutted house
and an unpaid drug bill behind him.  Since then the district had become
a monopoly, and no one had dared to measure himself against the
established fame of the Hoyland doctor.
