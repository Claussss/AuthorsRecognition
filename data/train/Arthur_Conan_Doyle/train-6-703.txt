Sir Robert Knolles had served in Brittany before, and he marshaled his
men on the march with the skill and caution of the veteran soldier, the
man who leaves as little as possible to chance, having too steadfast a
mind to heed the fool who may think him overcautious. He had recruited a
number of bowmen and men-at-arms at Dinan; so that his following was
now close upon five hundred men. In front under his own leadership were
fifty mounted lancers, fully armed and ready for any sudden attack.
Behind them on foot came the archers, and a second body of mounted men
closed up the rear. Out upon either flank moved small bodies of cavalry,
and a dozen scouts, spread fanwise, probed every gorge and dingle in
front of the column. So for three days he moved slowly down the Southern
Road.
