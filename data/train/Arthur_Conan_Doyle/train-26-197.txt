Froissart is always splendid. If you desire to avoid the mediaeval
French, which only a specialist can read with pleasure, you can get
Lord Berners' almost equally mediaeval, but very charming English,
or you can turn to a modern translation, such as this one of Johnes.
A single page of Lord Berners is delightful; but it is a strain,
I think, to read bulky volumes in an archaic style. Personally, I
prefer the modern, and even with that you have shown some patience
before you have reached the end of that big second tome.
