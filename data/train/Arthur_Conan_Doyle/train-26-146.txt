"His favourite author," says he, "was one writing on heroes in a
style resembling either early architecture or utter dilapidation, so
loose and rough it seemed. A wind-in-the-orchard style that tumbled
down here and there an appreciable fruit with uncouth bluster,
sentences without commencements running to abrupt endings and smoke,
like waves against a sea-wall, learned dictionary words giving a
hand to street slang, and accents falling on them haphazard, like
slant rays from driving clouds; all the pages in a breeze, the whole
book producing a kind of electrical agitation in the mind and joints."
