How they cheered and laughed, these gallant Englishmen, and how they
clapped me on the back! “Even money on the Frenchman,” cried Lord Sadler. “He fights foul,” cried my enemy, rubbing his crimson ears. “He savaged
me on the ground.” “You must take your chance of that,” said Lord Rufton, coldly. “Time!” cried Lord Sadler, and once again we advanced to the assault. He was flushed, and his small eyes were as vicious as those of a
bull-dog. There was hatred on his face. For my part I carried myself
lightly and gaily. A French gentleman fights but he does not hate. I
drew myself up before him, and I bowed as I have done in the duello.
