      “I cannot think how I came to overlook it,” said the Inspector,
      with an expression of annoyance.       “It was invisible, buried in the mud. I only saw it because I was
      looking for it.”       “What! You expected to find it?”       “I thought it not unlikely.”       He took the boots from the bag, and compared the impressions of
      each of them with marks upon the ground. Then he clambered up to
      the rim of the hollow, and crawled about among the ferns and
      bushes.
