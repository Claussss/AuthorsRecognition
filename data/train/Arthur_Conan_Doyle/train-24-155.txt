The forester shook his head. “I have wife and child at Emery Down,”
 quoth he; “I would not leave them for such a venture.” “You, then, young sir?” asked the archer. “Nay, I am a man of peace,” said Alleyne Edricson. “Besides, I have
other work to do.” “Peste!” growled the soldier, striking his flagon on the board until the
dishes danced again. “What, in the name of the devil, hath come over
the folk? Why sit ye all moping by the fireside, like crows round a dead
horse, when there is man's work to be done within a few short leagues of
ye? Out upon you all, as a set of laggards and hang-backs! By my hilt I
believe that the men of England are all in France already, and that what
is left behind are in sooth the women dressed up in their paltocks and
hosen.”
