That night a train of crestfallen archers, bearing many a prostrate
figure, marched sadly into Ploermel Castle. Behind them rode ten men,
all weary, all wounded, and all with burning hearts against William of
Montaubon for the foul trick that he had served them. But over at Josselin, yellow gorse-blossoms in their helmets, the
victors were borne in on the shoulders of a shouting mob, amid the
fanfare of trumpets and the beating of drums. Such was the combat of
the Midway Oak, where brave men met brave men, and such honor was gained
that from that day he who had fought in the Battle of the Thirty was
ever given the highest place and the post of honor, nor was it easy
for any man to pretend to have been there, for it has been said by that
great chronicler who knew them all, that not one on either side failed
to carry to his grave the marks of that stern encounter.
