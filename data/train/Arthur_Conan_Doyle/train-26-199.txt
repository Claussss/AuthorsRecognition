But without looking too curiously into his motives, it must be
admitted that the work could not have been done more thoroughly.
There is something of Herodotus in the Canon's cheery, chatty,
garrulous, take-it-or-leave-it manner. But he has the advantage
of the old Greek in accuracy. Considering that he belonged to the
same age which gravely accepted the travellers' tales of Sir John
Maundeville, it is, I think, remarkable how careful and accurate
the chronicler is. Take, for example, his description of Scotland
and the Scotch. Some would give the credit to Jean-le-Bel, but that
is another matter. Scotch descriptions are a subject over which a
fourteenth-century Hainaulter might fairly be allowed a little scope
for his imagination. Yet we can see that the account must on the
whole have been very correct. The Galloway nags, the girdle-cakes,
the bagpipes--every little detail rings true. Jean-le-Bel was
actually present in a Border campaign, and from him Froissart got
his material; but he has never attempted to embroider it, and its
accuracy, where we can to some extent test it, must predispose us
to accept his accounts where they are beyond our confirmation.
