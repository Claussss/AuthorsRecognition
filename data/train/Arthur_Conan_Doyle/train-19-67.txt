I know very well that about eight o'clock to-night that craving for her
society, that irresistible restlessness, will come upon me.  How shall
I overcome it?  What shall I do?  I must make it impossible for me to
leave the room.  I shall lock the door and throw the key out of the
window.  But, then, what am I to do in the morning?  Never mind about
the morning.  I must at all costs break this chain which holds me.
