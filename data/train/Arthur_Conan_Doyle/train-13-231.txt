      “And now I come to the queer part of the business. I was in
      diggings out Hampstead way—17, Potter’s Terrace. Well, I was
      sitting doing a smoke that very evening after I had been promised
      the appointment, when up came my landlady with a card which had
      ‘Arthur Pinner, Financial Agent,’ printed upon it. I had never
      heard the name before and could not imagine what he wanted with
      me; but, of course, I asked her to show him up. In he walked, a
      middle-sized, dark-haired, dark-eyed, black-bearded man, with a
      touch of the Sheeny about his nose. He had a brisk kind of way
      with him and spoke sharply, like a man who knew the value of
      time.”
