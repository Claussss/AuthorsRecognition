“Don't be down-hearted, Miss Adams,” said he. “This is a most
indefensible outrage, but there can be no question that steps will be
taken in the proper quarter to set the matter right. I am convinced that

If it had not been for that villain Mansoor, you need not have appeared
at all.” It was shocking to see the change in the little Bostonian lady, for she
had shrunk to an old woman in an hour. Her swarthy cheeks had fallen in,
and her eyes shone wildly from sunken, darkened sockets. Her frightened
glances were continually turned upon Sadie. There is surely some wrecker
angel which can only gather her best treasures in moments of disaster.
For here were all these worldlings going to their doom, and already
frivolity and selfishness had passed away from them, and each was
thinking and grieving only for the other. Sadie thought of her aunt, her
aunt thought of Sadie, the men thought of the women, Belmont thought of
his wife,--and then he thought of something else also, and he kicked his
camel's shoulder with his heel until he found himself upon the near side
of Miss Adams.
