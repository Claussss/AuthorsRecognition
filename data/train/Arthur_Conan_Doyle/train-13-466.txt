      “Precisely so,” said Mr. Acton. “There can be no possible doubt
      as to their intentions. I have the clearest claim upon half of
      their present estate, and if they could have found a single
      paper—which, fortunately, was in the strong-box of my
      solicitors—they would undoubtedly have crippled our case.”       “There you are,” said Holmes, smiling. “It was a dangerous,
      reckless attempt, in which I seem to trace the influence of young
      Alec. Having found nothing they tried to divert suspicion by
      making it appear to be an ordinary burglary, to which end they
      carried off whatever they could lay their hands upon. That is all
      clear enough, but there was much that was still obscure. What I
      wanted above all was to get the missing part of that note. I was
      certain that Alec had torn it out of the dead man’s hand, and
      almost certain that he must have thrust it into the pocket of his
      dressing-gown. Where else could he have put it? The only question
      was whether it was still there. It was worth an effort to find
      out, and for that object we all went up to the house.
