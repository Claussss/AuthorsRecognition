“They should be Germans, fair sir, by the fashion of their harness.” The two bodies of horsemen had moved slowly over the plain, with a
space of nearly a quarter of a mile between them. Now, having come two
bowshots from the hostile line, they halted. All that they could see
of the English was the long hedge, with an occasional twinkle of steel
through its leafy branches, and behind that the spear-heads of the
men-at-arms rising from amidst the brushwood and the vines. A lovely
autumn countryside with changing many-tinted foliage lay stretched
before them, all bathed in peaceful sunshine, and nothing save those
flickering fitful gleams to tell of the silent and lurking enemy who
barred their way. But the bold spirit of the French cavaliers rose the
higher to the danger. The clamor of their war-cries filled the air,
and they tossed their pennoned spears over their heads in menace and
defiance. From the English line it was a noble sight, the gallant,
pawing, curveting horses, the many-colored twinkling riders, the swoop
and wave and toss of plume and banner.
