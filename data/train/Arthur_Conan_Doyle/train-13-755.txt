      “The blind was not down in your room, and I could see Miss
      Harrison sitting there reading by the table. It was quarter-past
      ten when she closed her book, fastened the shutters, and retired.       “I heard her shut the door, and felt quite sure that she had
      turned the key in the lock.”       “The key!” ejaculated Phelps.       “Yes; I had given Miss Harrison instructions to lock the door on
      the outside and take the key with her when she went to bed. She
      carried out every one of my injunctions to the letter, and
      certainly without her co-operation you would not have that paper
      in your coat-pocket. She departed then and the lights went out,
      and I was left squatting in the rhododendron-bush.
