Of course I asked him why. "I am so placed that I cannot enter into particulars as freely as I
could wish," said he.  "Miss Penclosa is the friend of my friend, and
my position is a delicate one.  I can only say this: that I have myself
been the subject of some of the woman's experiments, and that they have
left a most unpleasant impression upon my mind." He could hardly expect me to be satisfied with that, and I tried hard
to get something more definite out of him, but without success.  Is it
conceivable that he could be jealous at my having superseded him?  Or
is he one of those men of science who feel personally injured when
facts run counter to their preconceived opinions?  He cannot seriously
suppose that because he has some vague grievance I am, therefore, to
abandon a series of experiments which promise to be so fruitful of
results.  He appeared to be annoyed at the light way in which I treated
his shadowy warnings, and we parted with some little coldness on both
sides.
