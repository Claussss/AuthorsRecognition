“It is the Seneschal of Toulouse, with his following,” said Johnston,
shading his eyes with his hand. “Had he been on this side of the water
he might have attempted something upon us.” “I think that it would be well that we should cross,” said Sir Nigel.
“It were pity to balk this worthy seneschal, should he desire to try
some small feat of arms.” “Nay, there is no ford nearer than Tourville,” answered the old archer.
“He is on his way to Villefranche, and short will be the shrift of any
Jacks who come into his hands, for he is a man of short speech. It
was he and the Seneschal of Beaucaire who hung Peter Wilkins, of the
Company, last Lammastide; for which, by the black rood of Waltham! they
shall hang themselves, if ever they come into our power. But here are
our comrades, Sir Nigel, and here is our camp.”
