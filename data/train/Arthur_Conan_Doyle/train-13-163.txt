      An instant later our door opened, and a tall young man entered
      the room. He was well but quietly dressed in a dark-grey suit,
      and carried a brown wide-awake in his hand. I should have put him
      at about thirty, though he was really some years older.       “I beg your pardon,” said he, with some embarrassment; “I suppose
      I should have knocked. Yes, of course I should have knocked. The
      fact is that I am a little upset, and you must put it all down to
      that.” He passed his hand over his forehead like a man who is
      half dazed, and then fell rather than sat down upon a chair.
