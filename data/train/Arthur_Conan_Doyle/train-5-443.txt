Monkhouse Lee had raised himself on his hands, and looked wildly about
him. "What's up?" he asked.  "I've been in the water.  Ah, yes; I remember." A look of fear came into his eyes, and he sank his face into his hands. "How did you fall in?" "I didn't fall in." "How, then?" "I was thrown in.  I was standing by the bank, and something from
behind picked me up like a feather and hurled me in.  I heard nothing,
and I saw nothing.  But I know what it was, for all that."
