censorious." "Ah! you evidently don't know the man, or you wouldn't ask.  There's
something damnable about him--something reptilian.  My gorge always
rises at him.  I should put him down as a man with secret vices--an
evil liver.  He's no fool, though.  They say that he is one  of the
best men in his line that they have ever had in the college."
