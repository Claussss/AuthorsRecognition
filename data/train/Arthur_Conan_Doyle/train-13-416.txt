      “If it’s a local villain there should not be much difficulty in
      running him down,” said Holmes with a yawn. “All right, Watson, I
      don’t intend to meddle.”       “Inspector Forrester, sir,” said the butler, throwing open the
      door.       The official, a smart, keen-faced young fellow, stepped into the
      room. “Good-morning, Colonel,” said he; “I hope I don’t intrude,
      but we hear that Mr. Holmes of Baker Street is here.”
