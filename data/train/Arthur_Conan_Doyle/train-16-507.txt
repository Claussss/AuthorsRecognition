As to the pecuniary success of our little experiment I can only judge
from the following letter from Tom Crabbe, which I transcribe exactly as
I received it:      "WHAT HO! MY RESUSCITATED CORPSE,      "You want to know how all goes in Brisport, I suppose. Well,
     I'll tell you. I'm cutting Markham and Davidson out completely,
     my boy. The day after our little joke I got a bruised leg (that
     baby), a cut head (the woman the baby fell upon), an
     erysipelas, and a bronchitis. Next day a fine rich cancer of
     Markham's threw him up and came over to me. Also a pneumonia
     and a man who swallowed a sixpence. I've never had a day since
     without half a dozen new names on the list, and I'm going to
     start a trap this week. Just let me know when you are going to
     set up, and I'll manage to run down, old man, and give you a
     start in business, if I have to stand on my head in the
     water-butt. Good-bye. Love from the Missus.
