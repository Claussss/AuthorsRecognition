Black Simon found Aylward seated under the poop with his back, against
Bartholomew the bowyer. He was whistling merrily as he carved a girl's
face upon the horn of his bow. “My friend,” said Simon, “will you come ashore to-night--for I have need
of your help?” Aylward crowed lustily. “Will I come, Simon? By my hilt, I shall be
right glad to put my foot on the good brown earth once more. All my life
I have trod it, and yet I would never have learned its worth had I not
journeyed in these cursed ships. We will go on shore together, Simon,
and we will seek out the women, if there be any there, for it seems a
long year since I heard their gentle voices, and my eyes are weary of
such faces as Bartholomew's or thine.”
