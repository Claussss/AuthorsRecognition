As we approached we saw that the light did indeed come from a small
cottage, which was built in a hollow, so as to be invisible from any
quarter save that from which we approached it. In front of this humble
dwelling a small patch of ground had been cleared of shrub, and in the
centre of this little piece of sward our missing steed stood grazing at
her leisure upon the scanty herbage. The same light which had attracted
us had doubtless caught her eye, and drawn her towards it by hopes of
oats and of water. With a grunt of satisfaction Saxon resumed possession
of his lost property, and leading her by the bridle, approached the door
of the solitary cottage.
