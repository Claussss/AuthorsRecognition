      â€œWell, last Monday evening I was taking a stroll down that way,
      when I met an empty van coming up the lane, and saw a pile of
      carpets and things lying about on the grass-plot beside the
      porch. It was clear that the cottage had at last been let. I
      walked past it, and wondered what sort of folk they were who had
      come to live so near us. And as I looked I suddenly became aware
      that a face was watching me out of one of the upper windows.
