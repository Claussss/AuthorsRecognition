      But it was destined that I should after all have a last word of
      greeting from my friend and comrade. I have said that his
      Alpine-stock had been left leaning against a rock which jutted on
      to the path. From the top of this boulder the gleam of something
      bright caught my eye, and, raising my hand, I found that it came
      from the silver cigarette-case which he used to carry. As I took
      it up a small square of paper upon which it had lain fluttered
      down on to the ground. Unfolding it, I found that it consisted of
      three pages torn from his note-book and addressed to me. It was
      characteristic of the man that the direction was a precise, and
      the writing as firm and clear, as though it had been written in
      his study.
