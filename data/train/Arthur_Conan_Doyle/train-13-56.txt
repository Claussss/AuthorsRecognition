      As Sherlock Holmes replaced the half-crown which he had drawn
      from his pocket, a fierce-looking elderly man strode out from the
      gate with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand.       “What’s this, Dawson!” he cried. “No gossiping! Go about your
      business! And you, what the devil do you want here?”       “Ten minutes’ talk with you, my good sir,” said Holmes in the
      sweetest of voices.
