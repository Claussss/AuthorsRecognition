In the middle district General Charles Knox, with the columns of
Pine-Coffin, Thorneycroft, Pilcher, and Henry, were engaged in the same
sort of work with the same sort of results. The most vigorous operations fell to the lot of General Elliot, who
worked over the northern and north-eastern district, which still
contained a large number of fighting burghers. In May and June Elliot
moved across to Vrede and afterwards down the eastern frontier of the
Colony, joining hands at last with Rundle at Harrismith. He then worked
his way back to Kroonstad through Reitz and Lindley. It was on this
journey that Sladen's Mounted Infantry had the sharp experience which
has been already narrated. Western's column, working independently,
co-operated with Elliot in this clearing of the north-east. In August
there were very large captures by Broadwood's force, which had attained
considerable mobility, ninety miles being covered by it on one occasion
in two days.
