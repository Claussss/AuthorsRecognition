During all this time I was in sore distress of mind, for I had never
seen anything either of Gabriel or of her brother since the interview
in which the general had discovered the communication which was kept up
between us. I had no doubt that some sort of restraint had been placed
upon them; and the thought that we had brought trouble on their heads
was a bitter one both to my sister and myself. Our anxiety, however, was considerably mitigated by the receipt, a
couple of days after my last talk with the general, of a note from
Mordaunt Heatherstone. This was brought us by a little, ragged urchin,
the son of one of the fishermen, who informed us that it had been handed
to him at the avenue gate by an old woman--who, I expect, must have been
the Cloomber cook.
