Then a bugle rang forth. With a sudden yell every spur struck deep,
every lance was laid in rest, and the whole gallant squadron flew like a
glittering thunderbolt for the center of the English line. A hundred yards they had crossed, and yet another hundred, but there
was no movement in front of them, and no sound save their own hoarse
battle-cries and the thunder of their horses. Ever swifter and swifter
they flew. From behind the hedge it was a vision of horses, white,
bay and black, their necks stretched, their nostrils distended, their
bellies to the ground, whilst of the rider one could but see a shield
with a plume-tufted visor above it, and a spear-head twinkling in front.
