CHAPTER VII There was nothing to show them as they journeyed onwards that they were
not on the very spot that they had passed at sunset upon the evening
before. The region of fantastic black hills and orange sand which
bordered the river had long been left behind, and everywhere now was the
same brown, rolling, gravelly plain, the ground-swell with the shining
rounded pebbles upon its surface, and the occasional little sprouts of
sage-green camel-grass. Behind and before it extended, to where far away
in front of them it sloped upwards towards a line of violet hills. The
sun was not high enough yet to cause the tropical shimmer, and the wide
landscape, brown with its violet edging, stood out with a hard clearness
in that dry, pure air. The long caravan straggled along at the slow
swing of the baggage-camels. Far out on the flanks rode the vedettes,
halting at every rise, and peering backwards with their hands shading
their eyes. In the distance their spears and rifles seemed to stick out
of them, straight and thin, like needles in knitting.
