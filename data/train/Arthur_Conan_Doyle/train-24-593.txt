“Hold, sirs, hold!” cried Norbury, ere a blow had been struck. “This
gentleman hath a two-handed sword, a good foot longer than that of our
friend.” “Take mine, Alleyne,” said Ford. “Nay, friends,” he answered, “I understand the weight and balance of
mine own. To work, sir, for our lord may need us at the abbey!” Tranter's great sword was indeed a mighty vantage in his favor. He stood
with his feet close together, his knees bent outwards, ready for a dash
inwards or a spring out. The weapon he held straight up in front of him
with blade erect, so that he might either bring it down with a swinging
blow, or by a turn of the heavy blade he might guard his own head and
body. A further protection lay in the broad and powerful guard which
crossed the hilt, and which was furnished with a deep and narrow notch,
in which an expert swordsman might catch his foeman's blade, and by
a quick turn of his wrist might snap it across. Alleyne, on the other
hand, must trust for his defence to his quick eye and active foot--for
his sword, though keen as a whetstone could make it, was of a light and
graceful build with a narrow, sloping pommel and a tapering steel.
