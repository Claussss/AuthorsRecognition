      I saw by the baronet’s clouded brow that he was deeply hurt by
      what he regarded as our desertion.       “When do you desire to go?” he asked coldly.       “Immediately after breakfast. We will drive in to Coombe Tracey,
      but Watson will leave his things as a pledge that he will come
      back to you. Watson, you will send a note to Stapleton to tell
      him that you regret that you cannot come.”
