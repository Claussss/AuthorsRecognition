      But it was only for a moment that we were at fault. At one
      corner, the corner nearest the room which we had left, there was
      a second door. Holmes sprang to it and pulled it open. A coat and
      waistcoat were lying on the floor, and from a hook behind the
      door, with his own braces round his neck, was hanging the
      managing director of the Franco-Midland Hardware Company. His
      knees were drawn up, his head hung at a dreadful angle to his
      body, and the clatter of his heels against the door made the
      noise which had broken in upon our conversation. In an instant I
      had caught him round the waist, and held him up while Holmes and
      Pycroft untied the elastic bands which had disappeared between
      the livid creases of skin. Then we carried him into the other
      room, where he lay with a clay-coloured face, puffing his purple
      lips in and out with every breathâ€”a dreadful wreck of all that he
      had been but five minutes before.
