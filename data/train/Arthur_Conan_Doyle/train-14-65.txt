      “I have not heard of any.”       “Thank you. Good-morning.”       Holmes returned to his seat with that quiet look of inward
      satisfaction which meant that he had a congenial task before him.       “Going out, Watson?”       “Unless I can help you.”       “No, my dear fellow, it is at the hour of action that I turn to
      you for aid. But this is splendid, really unique from some points
      of view. When you pass Bradley’s, would you ask him to send up a
      pound of the strongest shag tobacco? Thank you. It would be as
      well if you could make it convenient not to return before
      evening. Then I should be very glad to compare impressions as to
      this most interesting problem which has been submitted to us this
      morning.”
