‘There is no reason to advance, your Majesty, now that the surprise has
failed,’ said Saxon. ‘I had sent for carts to bridge over the trench,
according to the plan which is commended in the treatise, “De vallis et
fossis,” but they are useless now. We can but fight it out as we are.’ ‘To throw troops across would be to sacrifice them,’ said Wade. ‘We have
lost heavily, Colonel Saxon, but I think from the look of yonder bank
that ye have given a good account of the red-coats.’
