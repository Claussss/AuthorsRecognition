      “What then?”       “We shall get out at Canterbury.”       “And then?”       “Well, then we must make a cross-country journey to Newhaven, and
      so over to Dieppe. Moriarty will again do what I should do. He
      will get on to Paris, mark down our luggage, and wait for two
      days at the depôt. In the meantime we shall treat ourselves to a
      couple of carpet-bags, encourage the manufactures of the
      countries through which we travel, and make our way at our
      leisure into Switzerland, via Luxembourg and Basle.”
