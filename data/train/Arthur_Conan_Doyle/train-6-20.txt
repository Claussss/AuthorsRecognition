The Abbot's full and florid face shone with a quiet content as he
looked out at his huge but well-ordered household. Like every head of
a prosperous Abbey, Abbot John, the fourth of the name, was a man of
various accomplishments. Through his own chosen instruments he had to
minister a great estate and to keep order and decorum among a large body
of men living a celibate life. He was a rigid disciplinarian toward all
beneath him, a supple diplomatist to all above. He held high debate with
neighboring abbots and lords, with bishops, with papal legates, and even
on occasion with the King's majesty himself. Many were the subjects
with which he must be conversant. Questions of doctrine, questions of
building, points of forestry, of agriculture, of drainage, of feudal
law, all came to the Abbot for settlement. He held the scales of justice
in all the Abbey banlieue which stretched over many a mile of Hampshire
and of Surrey. To the monks his displeasure might mean fasting, exile to
some sterner community, or even imprisonment in chains. Over the layman
also he could hold any punishment save only corporeal death, instead
of which he had in hand the far more dreadful weapon of spiritual
excommunication.
