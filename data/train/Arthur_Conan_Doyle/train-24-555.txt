“Aye, by St. Paul!” observed Sir Nigel, “they both bear the print of
their armor upon their cotes-hardies. Methinks they are men who breathe
freer in a camp than a court.” “There are many of us who do that, Nigel,” said Chandos, “and the head
of the court is, I dare warrant, among them. But of these two men the
one is Sir Hugh Calverley, and the other is Sir Robert Knolles.” Sir Nigel and Sir Oliver craned their necks to have the clearer view of
these famous warriors, the one a chosen leader of free companies, the
other a man who by his fierce valor and energy had raised himself from
the lowest ranks until he was second only to Chandos himself in the
esteem of the army.
