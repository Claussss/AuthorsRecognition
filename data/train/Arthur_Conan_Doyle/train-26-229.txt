There's a fine bit of breezy polemics for the dreary fifties--a fine
bit of moral courage too for the University professor who ventured
to say it. I put him above Lamb as an essayist, because there is a flavour of
actual knowledge and of practical acquaintance with the problems and
affairs of life, which is lacking in the elfin Londoner. I do not
say that the latter is not the rarer quality. There are my "Essays
of Elia," and they are well-thumbed as you see, so it is not because
I love Lamb less that I love this other more. Both are exquisite,
but Wendell Holmes is for ever touching some note which awakens an
answering vibration within my own mind.
