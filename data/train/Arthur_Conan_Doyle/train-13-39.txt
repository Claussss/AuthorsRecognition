      “The tip was guarded by a disk of cork which we found beside his
      body,” said the Inspector. “His wife tells us that the knife had
      lain upon the dressing-table, and that he had picked it up as he
      left the room. It was a poor weapon, but perhaps the best that he
      could lay his hands on at the moment.”       “Very possible. How about these papers?”       “Three of them are receipted hay-dealers’ accounts. One of them
      is a letter of instructions from Colonel Ross. This other is a
      milliner’s account for thirty-seven pounds fifteen made out by
      Madame Lesurier, of Bond Street, to William Derbyshire. Mrs.
      Straker tells us that Derbyshire was a friend of her husband’s
      and that occasionally his letters were addressed here.”
