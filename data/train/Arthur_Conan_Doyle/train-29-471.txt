“‘Tell me, Helen,’ said she, ‘have you ever heard anyone whistle in the
dead of the night?’ “‘Never,’ said I. “‘I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your
sleep?’ “‘Certainly not. But why?’ “‘Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in the
morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it has
awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from—perhaps from the next
room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask you
whether you had heard it.’
