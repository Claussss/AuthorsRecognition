Scattered round in a respectful circle, six of the Abbey lay servants
and foresters, each holding a halter, were creeping toward him. Every
now and then, with a beautiful toss and swerve and plunge, the
great creature would turn upon one of his would-be captors, and with
outstretched head, flying mane and flashing teeth, would chase him
screaming to the safety of the wall, while the others would close
swiftly in behind and cast their ropes in the hope of catching neck or
leg, but only in their turn to be chased to the nearest refuge.
