It is possible to write down the names of fifty professors in great
seats of learning who have examined and endorsed these facts, and the
list would include many of the greatest intellects which the world has
produced in our time--Flammarion and Lombroso, Charles Richet and
Russel Wallace, Willie Reichel, Myers, Zollner, James, Lodge, and
Crookes.  Therefore the facts HAVE been endorsed by the only science
that has the right to express an opinion.  I have never, in my thirty
years of experience, known one single scientific man who went
thoroughly into this matter and did not end by accepting the Spiritual
solution.  Such may exist, but I repeat that I have never heard of him.
Let us, then, with confidence examine this matter of the "spiritual
body," to use the term made classical by Saint Paul.  There are many
signs in his writings that Paul was deeply versed in psychic matters,
and one of these is his exact definition of the natural and spiritual
bodies in the service which is the final farewell to life of every
Christian.  Paul picked his words, and if he had meant that man
consisted of a natural body and a spirit he would have said so.  When
he said "a spiritual body" he meant a body which contained the spirit
and yet was distinct from the ordinary natural body.  That is exactly
what psychic science has now shown to be true.
