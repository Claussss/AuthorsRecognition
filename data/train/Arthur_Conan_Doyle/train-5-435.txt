The lamp was turned half down, but Smith could see the details of the
room plainly enough.  It was all much as he had seen it before--the
frieze, the animal-headed gods, the banging crocodile, and the table
littered over with papers and dried leaves.  The mummy case stood
upright against the wall, but the mummy itself was missing.  There was
no sign of any second occupant of the room, and he felt as he withdrew
that he had probably done Bellingham an injustice.  Had he a guilty
secret to preserve, he would hardly leave his door open so that all the
world might enter.
