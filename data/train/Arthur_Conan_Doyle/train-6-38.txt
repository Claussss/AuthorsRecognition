Thus adjured, the frightened monk grew calmer in his bearing, though his
white lips and his startled eyes, with the gasping of his breath, told
of his inward tremors. â€œIf it please you, holy father, and you, reverend sacrist, it came about
in this way. James the subprior, and Brother John and I had spent our
day from sext onward on Hankley, cutting bracken for the cow-houses. We
were coming back over the five-virgate field, and the holy subprior was
telling us a saintly tale from the life of Saint Gregory, when there
came a sudden sound like a rushing torrent, and the foul fiend sprang
over the high wall which skirts the water-meadow and rushed upon us
with the speed of the wind. The lay brother he struck to the ground and
trampled into the mire. Then, seizing the good subprior in his teeth, he
rushed round the field, swinging him as though he were a fardel of old
clothes.
