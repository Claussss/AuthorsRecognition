      Holmes’s brow was dark with anxiety.       “We are going to Riding Thorpe Manor,” said he, “but we have
      heard nothing of what has passed there.”       “It’s a terrible business,” said the stationmaster. “They are

      herself—so the servants say. He’s dead and her life is despaired
      of. Dear, dear, one of the oldest families in the county of
      Norfolk, and one of the most honoured.”
