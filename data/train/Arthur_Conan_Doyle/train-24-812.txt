“Good master Pelligny,” said the landlord, “these gentlemen have not
gone very fast, and I have a horse in the stable at your disposal, for
I would rather have such bloody doings as you threaten outside the four
walls of mine auberge.” “I hurt my leg and cannot ride,” quoth the bishop's champion. “I
strained a sinew on the day that I slew the three men at Castelnau.” “God save you, master Pelligny!” cried the landlord. “It must be an
awesome thing to have so much blood upon one's soul. And yet I do not
wish to see so valiant a man mishandled, and so I will, for friendship's
sake, ride after this Englishman and bring him back to you.”
