But of all the wayfarers those which interested Nigel most were
the soldiers. Several times they passed little knots of archers or
men-at-arms, veterans from France, who had received their discharge and
were now making their way to their southland homes. They were half drunk
all of them, for the wayfarers treated them to beer at the frequent
inns and ale-stakes which lined the road, so that they cheered and sang
lustily as they passed. They roared rude pleasantries at Aylward, who
turned in his saddle and shouted his opinion of them until they were out
of hearing.
