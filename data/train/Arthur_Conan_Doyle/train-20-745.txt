      When we descended I followed Holmes into the stable yard, where
      he opened the door of a loose-box and led out a squat, lop-eared,
      white-and-tan dog, something between a beagle and a foxhound.       “Let me introduce you to Pompey,” said he. “Pompey is the pride
      of the local draghounds—no very great flier, as his build will
      show, but a staunch hound on a scent. Well, Pompey, you may not
      be fast, but I expect you will be too fast for a couple of
      middle-aged London gentlemen, so I will take the liberty of
      fastening this leather leash to your collar. Now, boy, come
      along, and show what you can do.” He led him across to the
      doctor’s door. The dog sniffed round for an instant, and then
      with a shrill whine of excitement started off down the street,
      tugging at his leash in his efforts to go faster. In half an
      hour, we were clear of the town and hastening down a country
      road.
