      “I am usually an extremely sound sleeper. It has been a standing
      jest in the family that nothing could ever wake me during the
      night. And yet somehow on that particular night, whether it may
      have been the slight excitement produced by my little adventure
      or not I know not, but I slept much more lightly than usual. Half
      in my dreams I was dimly conscious that something was going on in
      the room, and gradually became aware that my wife had dressed
      herself and was slipping on her mantle and her bonnet. My lips
      were parted to murmur out some sleepy words of surprise or
      remonstrance at this untimely preparation, when suddenly my
      half-opened eyes fell upon her face, illuminated by the
      candle-light, and astonishment held me dumb. She wore an
      expression such as I had never seen before—such as I should have
      thought her incapable of assuming. She was deadly pale and
      breathing fast, glancing furtively towards the bed as she
      fastened her mantle, to see if she had disturbed me. Then,
      thinking that I was still asleep, she slipped noiselessly from
      the room, and an instant later I heard a sharp creaking which
      could only come from the hinges of the front door. I sat up in
      bed and rapped my knuckles against the rail to make certain that
      I was truly awake. Then I took my watch from under the pillow. It
      was three in the morning. What on this earth could my wife be
      doing out on the country road at three in the morning?
