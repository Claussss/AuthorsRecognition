“Nay, there can be no difficulty there,” said Chandos. “Pardieu! a
roistering, swaggering dare-devil archer is worth his price on the
French border. There are two hundred such who march behind my own
person, and I would ask nothing better than to see you among them.” “I thank you, noble sir, for your offer,” said Aylward, “and I had
rather follow your banner than many another one, for it is well known
that it goes ever forward, and I have heard enough of the wars to know
that there are small pickings for the man who lags behind. Yet, if the
Squire will have me, I would choose to fight under the five roses of
Loring, for though I was born in the hundred of Easebourne and the rape
of Chichester, yet I have grown up and learned to use the longbow in
these parts, and as the free son of a free franklin I had rather serve
my own neighbor than a stranger.”
