Evening.  When I came to Wilson's, I was shown up, and found that he
was sitting with Miss Penclosa.  For half an hour I had to endure his
fussy talk about his recent research into the exact nature of the
spiritualistic rap, while the creature and I sat in silence looking
across the room at each other.  I read a sinister amusement in her
eyes, and she must have seen hatred and menace in mine.  I had almost
despaired of having speech with her when he was called from the room,
and we were left for a few moments together.
