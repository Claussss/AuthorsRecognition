My father raised his eyebrows to indicate the doubt which his
hospitality forbade him from putting into words. “I think, gentlemen,” he said, “that you are both sorely in need of rest
after your perilous adventures. If you will follow me I shall lead you
to your rooms.” He conducted them with old-fashioned ceremony to the laird's best spare
bedroom, and then, returning to me in the parlour, proposed that we
should go down together to the beach and learn whether anything fresh
had occurred.
