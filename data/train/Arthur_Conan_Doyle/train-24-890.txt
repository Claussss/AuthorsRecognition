The narrow pass was blocked by huge stones littered in wild confusion
over each other, with the blue choking smoke reeking up through the
crevices. The explosion had blown in the wall and cut off the only path
by which they could descend. Pent in, a hundred feet from earth, with
a furnace raging under them and a ravening multitude all round who
thirsted for their blood, it seemed indeed as though no men had ever
come through such peril with their lives. Slowly they made their way
back to the summit, but as they came out upon it the Lady Tiphaine
darted forward and caught her husband by the wrist.
