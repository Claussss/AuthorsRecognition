As to spirit photography, the most successful results are obtained by
the Crewe circle in England, under the mediumship of Mr. Hope and Mrs.
Buxton.[2]  I have seen scores of these photographs, which in several
cases reproduce exact images of the dead which do not correspond with
any pictures of them taken during life.  I have seen father, mother,
and dead soldier son, all taken together with the dead son looking far
the happier and not the least substantial of the three.  It is in these
varied forms of proof that the impregnable strength of the evidence
lies, for how absurd do explanations of telepathy, unconscious
cerebration or cosmic memory become when faced by such phenomena as
spirit photography, materialisation, or the direct voice.  Only one
hypothesis can cover every branch of these manifestations, and that is
the system of extraneous life and action which has always, for seventy
years, held the field for any reasonable mind which had impartially
considered the facts.
