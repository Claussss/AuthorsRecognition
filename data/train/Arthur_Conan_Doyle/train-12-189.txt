“I would not intrude upon your secrets, Mr. Haw,” said Robert, “but
of course I cannot deny that I should be very proud and pleased if you
cared to confide them to me.” “And I will. Not all. I do not think that I shall ever, while I live,
tell all. But I shall leave directions behind me so that when I die you
may be able to carry on my unfinished work. I shall tell you where those
directions are to be found. In the meantime, you must be content to
learn the effects which I produce without knowing every detail as to the
means.”
