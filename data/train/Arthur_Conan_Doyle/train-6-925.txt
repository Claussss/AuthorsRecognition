Nigel and his little troop of men-at-arms were riding past the archers
when Black Simon with a sudden exclamation touched his leader upon the
arm. “See yonder, fair sir,” he cried, with gleaming eyes, “there where the
wastrel walks with the great fardel upon his back! Who is he who marches
behind him?” Nigel looked, and was aware of a stunted peasant who bore upon his
rounded back an enormous bundle very much larger than himself. Behind
him walked a burly broad-shouldered archer, whose stained jerkin and
battered headpiece gave token of long and hard service. His bow was
slung over his shoulder, and his arms were round the waists of two buxom
Frenchwomen, who tripped along beside him with much laughter and many
saucy answers flung back over their shoulders to a score of admirers
behind them.
