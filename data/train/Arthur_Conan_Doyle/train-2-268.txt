“Well, apart from this cigarette-end, was it not suggestive that the
only time the lodger went out was immediately after his taking the
rooms? He came back—or someone came back—when all witnesses were out of
the way. We have no proof that the person who came back was the person
who went out. Then, again, the man who took the rooms spoke English
well. This other, however, prints ‘match’ when it should have been
‘matches.’ I can imagine that the word was taken out of a dictionary,
which would give the noun but not the plural. The laconic style may be
to conceal the absence of knowledge of English. Yes, Watson, there are
good reasons to suspect that there has been a substitution of lodgers.”
