I slipped my clinical thermometer into his armpit and counted his pulse
rate. It amounted to 120 per minute, and his temperature proved to be
104 degrees. Clearly it was a case of remittent fever, such as occurs in
men who have spent a great part of their lives in the tropics. “There is no danger,” I remarked. “With a little quinine and arsenic we
shall very soon overcome the attack and restore his health.”
