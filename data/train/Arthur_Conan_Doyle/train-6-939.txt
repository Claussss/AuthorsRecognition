rises as a squire errant. I stood no higher, nor so high, at your age.” Nigel flushed with pride and pleasure. “Indeed, my dear lord, it is very
little that I have done. But now that I am back at your side I hope that
in truth I shall learn to bear myself in worthy fashion, for where else
should I win honor if it be not under your banner.”
