“Bring water!” said the Prince. “Let the royal leech see to him; for I
had rather lose many men than the good Sir James. Ha, Chandos, what have
we here?” A knight lay across the path with his helmet beaten down upon his
shoulders. On his surcoat and shield were the arms of a red griffin. “It is Robert de Duras the spy,” said Chandos. “Well for him that he has met his end,” said the angry Prince. “Put him
on his shield, Hubert, and let four archers bear him to the monastery.
Lay him at the feet of the Cardinal and say that by this sign I greet
him. Place my flag on yonder high bush, Walter, and let my tent be
raised there, that my friends may know where to seek me.”
