“In truth, yes!” cried Nigel, and in a flash the dark eyes of Mary
Buttesthorn rose before him, and he heard her low, sweet, earnest voice
as he had heard it that night when they brought her frailer sister back
from Shalford Manor, a voice which made all that was best and noblest
in a man thrill within his soul. “Yet, bethink you, archer, that what
a woman loves in man is not his gross body, but rather his soul, his
honor, his fame, the deeds with which he has made his life beautiful.
Therefore you are winning love as well as glory when you turn to the
wars.”
