“Ha!” cried Du Guesclin, with his eyes flashing in triumph, “you hear
her, Sir Nigel?--and she never yet said word which was not sooth.” The English knight shook his head moodily. “What of my own poor
country?” said he. “I fear, lady, that what you have said bodes but
small good for her.” The lady sat with parted lips, and her breath came quick and fast. “My
God!” she cried, “what is this that is shown me? Whence come they, these
peoples, these lordly nations, these mighty countries which rise up
before me? I look beyond, and others rise, and yet others, far and
farther to the shores of the uttermost waters. They crowd! They swarm!
The world is given to them, and it resounds with the clang of their
hammers and the ringing of their church bells. They call them many
names, and they rule them this way or that but they are all English,
for I can hear the voices of the people. On I go, and onwards over seas
where man hath never yet sailed, and I see a great land under new
stars and a stranger sky, and still the land is England. Where have her
children not gone? What have they not done? Her banner is planted on
ice. Her banner is scorched in the sun. She lies athwart the lands, and
her shadow is over the seas. Bertrand, Bertrand! we are undone for the
buds of her bud are even as our choicest flower!” Her voice rose into
a wild cry, and throwing up her arms she sank back white and nerveless
into the deep oaken chair.
