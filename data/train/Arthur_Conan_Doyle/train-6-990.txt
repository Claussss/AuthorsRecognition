But a great good fortune had come to them--so great that as they looked
down the valley they could scarce credit their own senses. Behind the
division of the Dauphin, which had pressed them so hard, stood a second
division hardly less numerous, led by the Duke of Orleans. The fugitives
from in front, blood-smeared and bedraggled, blinded with sweat and with
fear, rushed amidst its ranks in their flight, and in a moment, without
a blow being struck, had carried them off in their wild rout. This vast
array, so solid and so martial, thawed suddenly away like a snow-wreath
in the sun. It was gone, and in its place thousands of shining dots
scattered over the whole plain as each man made his own way to the spot
where he could find his horse and bear himself from the field. For a
moment it seemed that the battle was won, and a thundershout of joy
pealed up from the English line.
