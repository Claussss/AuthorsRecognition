As in some strange dream he was aware of that deed of arms within the
courtyard below. Dimly it came back to his memory afterwards the sudden
startled shout, the crash of metal, the slamming of great gates, the
roar of many voices, the clang, clang, clang, as of fifty lusty smiths
upon their anvils, and then at last the dwindling of the hubbub, the
low groans and sudden shrill cries to the saints, the measured murmur of
many voices, the heavy clanking of armored feet.
