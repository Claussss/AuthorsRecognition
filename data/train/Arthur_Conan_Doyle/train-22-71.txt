“Mrs. Douglas had visitors to tea,” said Ames. “I couldn't raise it
until they went. Then I wound it up myself.” “Then it comes to this,” said the sergeant: “If anyone came from
outside--IF they did--they must have got in across the bridge before
six and been in hiding ever since, until Mr. Douglas came into the room
after eleven.” “That is so! Mr. Douglas went round the house every night the last thing
before he turned in to see that the lights were right. That brought him
in here. The man was waiting and shot him. Then he got away through the
window and left his gun behind him. That's how I read it; for nothing
else will fit the facts.”
