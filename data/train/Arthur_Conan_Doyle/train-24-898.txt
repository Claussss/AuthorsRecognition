“Had we a rope,” said Alleyne, “there is one side which is not yet on
fire, down which we might slip.” “But how to get a rope?” “It is an old trick,” quoth Aylward. “Hola! Johnston, cast me up a rope,
even as you did at Maupertuis in the war time.” The grizzled archer thus addressed took several lengths of rope from his
comrades, and knotting them firmly together, he stretched them out in
the long shadow which the rising sun threw from the frowning keep. Then
he fixed the yew-stave of his bow upon end and measured the long, thin,
black line which it threw upon the turf.
