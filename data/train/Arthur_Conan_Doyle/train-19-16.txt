I was watching Agatha narrowly.  During three passes she seemed to be
simply amused.  At the fourth I observed a slight glazing of her eyes,
accompanied by some dilation of her pupils.  At the sixth there was a
momentary rigor.  At the seventh her lids began to droop.  At the tenth
her eyes were closed, and her breathing was slower and fuller than
usual.  I tried as I watched to preserve my scientific calm, but a
foolish, causeless agitation convulsed me.  I trust that I hid it, but
I felt as a child feels in the dark.  I could not have believed that I
was still open to such weakness.
