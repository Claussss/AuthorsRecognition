It was indeed the formidable figure of the Lady Ermyntrude, gaunt,
bowed and leaning on her staff, which had emerged from the door of the
manor-house and advanced to greet them. She croaked with laughter, and
shook her stick at the great building as she heard of the discomfiture
of the Abbey court. Then she led the way into the hall where the best
which she could provide had been laid out for their illustrious guest.
There was Chandos blood in her own veins, traceable back through the de
Greys, de Multons, de Valences, de Montagues and other high and noble
strains, so that the meal had been eaten and cleared before she had done
tracing the network of intermarriages and connections, with quarterings,
impalements, lozenges and augmentations by which the blazonry of the two
families might be made to show a common origin. Back to the Conquest and
before it there was not a noble family-tree every twig and bud of which
was not familiar to the Dame Ermyntrude.
