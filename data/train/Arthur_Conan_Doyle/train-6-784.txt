Burned and bruised, but unconscious of either pain or fatigue for the
turmoil of his spirit within him, Nigel knelt by the Frenchman and
loosened his helmet. The girlish face of the young Squire was white as
chalk, and the haze of death was gathering over his violet eyes, but
a faint smile played round his lips as he looked up at his English
comrade. “I shall never see Beatrice again,” he whispered. “I pray you, Nigel,
that when there is a truce you will journey as far as my father's
chateau and tell him how his son died. Young Gaston will rejoice, for
to him come the land and the coat, the war-cry and the profit. See them,
Nigel, and tell them that I was as forward as the others.”
