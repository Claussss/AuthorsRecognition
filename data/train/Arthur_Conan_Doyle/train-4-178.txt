to bar the man’s passage. ‘What news from the West?’ ‘I must not tarry,’ the messenger gasped, slackening his speed for an
instant. ‘I bear papers of import from Gregory Alford, Mayor of Lyme, to
Ins Majesty’s Council. The rebels make great head, and gather together
like bees in the swarming time. There are some thousands in arms
already, and all Devonshire is on the move. The rebel horse under Lord
Grey hath been beaten back from Bridport by the red militia of Dorset,
but every prickeared Whig from the Channel to the Severn is making his
way to Monmouth.’ With this brief summary of the news he pushed his way
past us and clattered on in a cloud of dust upon his mission.
