      â€œWhen I first came up to London I had rooms in Montague Street,
      just round the corner from the British Museum, and there I
      waited, filling in my too abundant leisure time by studying all
      those branches of science which might make me more efficient. Now
      and again cases came in my way, principally through the
      introduction of old fellow-students, for during my last years at
      the University there was a good deal of talk there about myself
      and my methods. The third of these cases was that of the Musgrave
      Ritual, and it is to the interest which was aroused by that
      singular chain of events, and the large issues which proved to be
      at stake, that I trace my first stride towards the position which
      I now hold.
