      “The moment I looked at my table, I was aware that someone had
      rummaged among my papers. The proof was in three long slips. I
      had left them all together. Now, I found that one of them was
      lying on the floor, one was on the side table near the window,
      and the third was where I had left it.”       Holmes stirred for the first time.       “The first page on the floor, the second in the window, the third
      where you left it,” said he.
