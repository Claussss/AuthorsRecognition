And straightway the old Knight began a long and weary lecture upon the
times of grace and when each beast and bird was seasonable, with many
anecdotes, illustrations, warnings and exceptions, drawn from his own
great experience. He spoke also of the several ranks and grades of the
chase: how the hare, hart and boar must ever take precedence over
the buck, the doe, the fox, the marten and the roe, even as a knight
banneret does over a knight, while these in turn are of a higher class
to the badger, the wildcat or the otter, who are but the common populace
of the world of beasts. Of blood-stains also he spoke--how the skilled
hunter may see at a glance if blood be dark and frothy, which means a
mortal hurt, or thin and clear, which means that the arrow has struck a
bone.
