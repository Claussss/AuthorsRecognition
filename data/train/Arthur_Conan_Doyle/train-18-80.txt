I have alluded in this brief way to the double tie which sprang up
between the two families, because I have no wish that this narrative
should degenerate into anything approaching to romance, or that I should
lose the thread of the facts which I have set myself to chronicle. These
are connected with General Heatherstone, and only indirectly with my own
personal history. It is enough if I say that after our engagement the visits to Branksome
became more frequent, and that our friends were able sometimes to spend
a whole day with us when business had called the general to Wigtown, or
when his gout confined him to his room.
