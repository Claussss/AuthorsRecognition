Had there been bad weather I do not know what we should have done, but
we still went gaily upon our way with a wind which was strong enough to
drive us swiftly south, but not strong enough to cause us alarm. On the

from the platform in the front of the vessel. “Look, Gerard, look!” he
cried, and pointed over the pole which stuck out in front.
