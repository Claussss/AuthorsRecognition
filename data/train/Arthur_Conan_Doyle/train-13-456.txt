      “On the contrary,” answered the Colonel, warmly, “I consider it
      the greatest privilege to have been permitted to study your
      methods of working. I confess that they quite surpass my
      expectations, and that I am utterly unable to account for your
      result. I have not yet seen the vestige of a clue.”       “I am afraid that my explanation may disillusionize you but it
      has always been my habit to hide none of my methods, either from
      my friend Watson or from any one who might take an intelligent
      interest in them. But, first, as I am rather shaken by the
      knocking about which I had in the dressing-room, I think that I
      shall help myself to a dash of your brandy, Colonel. My strength
      has been rather tried of late.”
