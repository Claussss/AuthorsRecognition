The practical engineers looked a little pale, and fidgeted nervously
with the wires.  Even the hardened Marshal was ill at ease, for a mere
hanging was one thing, and this blasting of flesh and blood a very

sheets which lay before them.  The only man who appeared to feel none
of the influence of these preparations was the little German crank, who
strolled from one to the other with a smile on his lips and mischief in
his eyes.  More than once he even went so far as to burst into a shout
of laughter, until the chaplain sternly rebuked him for his ill-timed
levity.
