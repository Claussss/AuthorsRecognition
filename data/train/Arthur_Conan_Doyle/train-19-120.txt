"Do you mean----" I cried. "I mean that as I opened the door last night you rushed out upon me,
struck me with both your fists in the face, knocked me down, kicked me
furiously in the side, and left me lying almost unconscious in the
street.  Look at your own hand bearing witness against you." Yes, there it was, puffed up, with sponge-like knuckles, as after some
terrific blow.  What could I do?  Though he put me down as a madman, I
must tell him all.  I sat by his bed and went over all my troubles from
the beginning.  I poured them out with quivering hands and burning
words which might have carried conviction to the most sceptical.  "She
hates you and she hates me!" I cried.  "She revenged herself last night
on both of us at once.  She saw me leave the ball, and she must have
seen you also.  She knew how long it would take you to reach home.
Then she had but to use her wicked will.  Ah, your bruised face is a
small thing beside my bruised soul!"
