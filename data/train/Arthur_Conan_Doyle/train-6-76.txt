The young Squire was the first to recover, and kneeling by the panting,
overwrought horse he passed his hand gently over the tangled mane and
down the foam-flecked face. The red eye rolled up at him; but it was
wonder not hatred, a prayer and not a threat, which he could read in it.
As he stroked the reeking muzzle, the horse whinnied gently and thrust
his nose into the hollow of his hand. It was enough. It was the end of
the contest, the acceptance of new conditions by a chivalrous foe from a
chivalrous victor.
