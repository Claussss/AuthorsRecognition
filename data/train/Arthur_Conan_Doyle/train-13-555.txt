      We were conscious of a long scrutiny out of the darkness.       “Yes, yes, it’s all right,” said the voice at last. “You can come
      up, and I am sorry if my precautions have annoyed you.”       He relit the stair gas as he spoke, and we saw before us a
      singular-looking man, whose appearance, as well as his voice,
      testified to his jangled nerves. He was very fat, but had
      apparently at some time been much fatter, so that the skin hung
      about his face in loose pouches, like the cheeks of a
      blood-hound. He was of a sickly colour, and his thin, sandy hair
      seemed to bristle up with the intensity of his emotion. In his
      hand he held a pistol, but he thrust it into his pocket as we
      advanced.
