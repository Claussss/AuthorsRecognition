That is Mr. Soames’ tea time.”       “How long did you stay?”       “When I saw that he was absent, I withdrew at once.”       “Did you look at these papers on the table?”       “No, sir—certainly not.”       “How came you to leave the key in the door?”       “I had the tea-tray in my hand. I thought I would come back for
      the key. Then I forgot.”
