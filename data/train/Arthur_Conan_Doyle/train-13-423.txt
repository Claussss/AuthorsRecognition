      “This writing is of extraordinary interest,” said Holmes, who had
      been examining it with intense concentration. “These are much
      deeper waters than I had thought.” He sank his head upon his
      hands, while the Inspector smiled at the effect which his case

      his hands again and remained for some minutes in the deepest

      before his illness. He sprang to his feet with all his old
      energy.
