Behind the King, clad in his best, but looking drab and sorry amid the
brilliant costumes round him, Nigel himself, regardless of an aching
body and a twisted knee, waited upon his royal guests, who threw many
a merry jest at him over their shoulders as they still chuckled at the
adventure of the bridge. “By the rood!” said King Edward, leaning back, with a chicken bone held
daintily between the courtesy fingers of his left hand, “the play is
too good for this country stage. You must to Windsor with me, Nigel, and
bring with you this great suit of harness in which you lurk. There you
shall hold the lists with your eyes in your midriff, and unless some
one cleave you to the waist I see not how any harm can befall you. Never
have I seen so small a nut in so great a shell.”
