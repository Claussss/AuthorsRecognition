      “You never heard me talk of Victor Trevor?” he asked. “He was the
      only friend I made during the two years I was at college. I was
      never a very sociable fellow, Watson, always rather fond of
      moping in my rooms and working out my own little methods of
      thought, so that I never mixed much with the men of my year. Bar
      fencing and boxing I had few athletic tastes, and then my line of
      study was quite distinct from that of the other fellows, so that
      we had no points of contact at all. Trevor was the only man I
      knew, and that only through the accident of his bull terrier
      freezing on to my ankle one morning as I went down to chapel.
