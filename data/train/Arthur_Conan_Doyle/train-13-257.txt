      At seven o’clock that evening we were walking, the three of us,
      down Corporation Street to the company’s offices.       “It is no use our being at all before our time,” said our client.
      “He only comes there to see me, apparently, for the place is
      deserted up to the very hour he names.”       “That is suggestive,” remarked Holmes.       “By Jove, I told you so!” cried the clerk. “That’s he walking
      ahead of us there.”
