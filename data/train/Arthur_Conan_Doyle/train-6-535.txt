Again he raised his mace and was advancing on the helpless crowd where
the brave were encumbered and hampered by the weaklings, when Nigel
shook himself clear and bounded forward into the open, his sword in his
hand and a smile of welcome upon his lips. The sun had set, and one long mauve gash across the western Channel was
closing swiftly into the dull grays of early night. Above, a few stars
began to faintly twinkle; yet the twilight was still bright enough for
an observer to see every detail of the scene: the Marie Rose, dipping
and rising on the long rollers astern; the broad French boat with its
white deck blotched with blood and littered with bodies; the group of
men in the stern, some trying to advance and some seeking to escape--all
a confused, disorderly, struggling rabble.
