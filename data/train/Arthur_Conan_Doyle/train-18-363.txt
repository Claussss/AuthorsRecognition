I do not wish to whine or to whimper, but I cannot help feeling that I
have had hard measure dealt me in this world. I would not, God knows,
take the life of any man, far less an aged one, in cold blood. My temper
and nature, however, were always fiery and headstrong, and in action
when my blood is up, I have no knowledge of what I am about. Neither
the corporal nor I would have laid a finger upon Ghoolab Shah had we not
seen that the tribesmen were rallying behind him. Well, well, it is an
old story now, and there is no profit in discussing it. May no other
poor fellow ever have the same evil fortune!
