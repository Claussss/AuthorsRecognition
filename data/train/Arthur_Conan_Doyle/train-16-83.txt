     "I need say no more, sir. You will understand the terrible task
     which has fallen upon my poor sister and me in endeavoring to
     save my father from the asylum which in his sane moments filled
     him with horror. I can only regret that your peace has been
     disturbed by our misfortunes, and I offer you in my sister's
     name and my own our apologies.      "Yours truly,      "J. CAMERON."
