are painted red. I know not what these may be.” “But I could hazard a guess!” cried Chandos. “Surely they are the three
ships with my own men on their way to Brittany.” “You have hit it, John,” said the King. “But look, I pray you! What in
the name of the Virgin is that?” Four brilliant stars of flashing light had shone out from different
points of the cloud-bank. The next instant as many tall ships had
swooped forth into the sunshine. A fierce shout rang from the King's
ship, and was taken up all down the line, until the whole coast from
Dungeness to Winchelsea echoed the warlike greeting. The King sprang up
with a joyous face.
