The broad flood of steel, after oozing slowly forward, had stopped about
a mile from the English front. The greater part of the army had then
descended from their horses, while a crowd of varlets and hostlers led
them to the rear. The French formed themselves now into three great
divisions, which shimmered in the sun like silvery pools, reed-capped
with many a thousand of banners and pennons. A space of several hundred
yards divided each. At the same time two bodies of horsemen formed
themselves in front. The first consisted of three hundred men in one
thick column, the second of a thousand, riding in a more extended line.
