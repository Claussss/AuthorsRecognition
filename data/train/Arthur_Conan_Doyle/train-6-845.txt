On the other hand, the surrounding castles, and especially that of
Josselin, were held by strong forces of enthusiastic Bretons, inflamed
by a common patriotism, and full of warlike ardor. Robert of Beaumanoir,
the fierce seneschal of the house of Rohan, pushed constant forays and
excursions against Ploermel so that town and castle were both in daily
dread of being surrounded and besieged. Several small parties of the
English faction had been cut off and slain to a man, and so straitened
were the others that it was difficult for them to gather provisions from
the country round.
