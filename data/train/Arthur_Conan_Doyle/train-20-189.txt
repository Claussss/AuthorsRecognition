      “I think that I can help you to pass an hour in an interesting
      and profitable manner,” said Holmes, drawing his chair up to the

      natural curiosity to remain so long unsatisfied. To you,
      Inspector, the whole incident may appeal as a remarkable
      professional study. I must tell you, first of all, the
      interesting circumstances connected with the previous
      consultations which Mr. Hilton Cubitt has had with me in Baker

      productions, at which one might smile, had they not proved

      random sketches of children.
