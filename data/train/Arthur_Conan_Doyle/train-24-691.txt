“He would contend with these five knights, each to choose such weapons
as suit him best.” “I perceive,” said the prince, “that your master is a man of great heart
and high of enterprise. But the sun already is low in the west, and
there will scarce be light for these courses. I pray you, gentlemen, to
take your places, that we may see whether this stranger's deeds are as
bold as his words.” The unknown knight had sat like a statue of steel, looking neither to
the right nor to the left during these preliminaries. He had changed
from the horse upon which he had ridden, and bestrode the black charger
which his squire had led beside him. His immense breadth, his stern
composed appearance, and the mode in which he handled his shield and his
lance, were enough in themselves to convince the thousands of critical
spectators that he was a dangerous opponent. Aylward, who stood in
the front row of the archers with Simon, big John, and others of the
Company, had been criticising the proceedings from the commencement with
the ease and freedom of a man who had spent his life under arms and had
learned in a hard school to know at a glance the points of a horse and
his rider. He stared now at the stranger with a wrinkled brow and the
air of a man who is striving to stir his memory.
