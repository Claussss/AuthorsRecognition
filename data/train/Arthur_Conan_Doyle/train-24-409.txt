“It is a shrine of Our Lady,” said Terlake, “and a blind beggar who
lives by the alms of those who worship there.” “A shrine!” cried the knight. “Then let us put up an orison.” Pulling
off his cap, and clasping his hands, he chanted in a shrill voice:
“Benedictus dominus Deus meus, qui docet manus meas ad proelium,
et digitos meos ad bellum.” A strange figure he seemed to his three
squires, perched on his huge horse, with his eyes upturned and the
wintry sun shimmering upon his bald head. “It is a noble prayer,” he
remarked, putting on his hat again, “and it was taught to me by the
noble Chandos himself. But how fares it with you, father? Methinks that
I should have ruth upon you, seeing that I am myself like one who looks
through a horn window while his neighbors have the clear crystal. Yet,
by St. Paul! there is a long stride between the man who hath a horn
casement and him who is walled in on every hand.”
