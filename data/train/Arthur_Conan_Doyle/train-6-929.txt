So Aylward, having given instructions to the bearer of his feather-bed,
rode away in spite of shrill protests from his French companions, who
speedily consoled themselves with those of his comrades who seemed to
have most to give. Nigel's party was soon clear of the column of archers
and riding hard in the direction of the Prince's army. They passed by a
narrow and winding track, through the great wood of Nouaille, and found
before them a marshy valley down which ran a sluggish stream. Along its
farther bank hundreds of horses were being watered, and beyond was
a dense block of wagons. Through these the comrades passed, and then
topped a small mound from which the whole strange scene lay spread
before them.
