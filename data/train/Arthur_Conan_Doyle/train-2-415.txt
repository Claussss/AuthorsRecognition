Holmes groaned. “Do what you can for me. Let bygones be bygones,” he whispered. “I’ll
put the words out of my head—I swear I will. Only cure me, and I’ll
forget it.” “Forget what?” “Well, about Victor Savage’s death. You as good as admitted just now
that you had done it. I’ll forget it.” “You can forget it or remember it, just as you like. I don’t see you in
the witnessbox. Quite another shaped box, my good Holmes, I assure you.
It matters nothing to me that you should know how my nephew died. It’s
not him we are talking about. It’s you.”
