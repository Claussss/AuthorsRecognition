      It was twenty past three when we reached our terminus, and after
      a hasty luncheon at the buffet we pushed on at once to Scotland
      Yard. Holmes had already wired to Forbes, and we found him
      waiting to receive usâ€”a small, foxy man with a sharp but by no
      means amiable expression. He was decidedly frigid in his manner
      to us, especially when he heard the errand upon which we had
      come.
