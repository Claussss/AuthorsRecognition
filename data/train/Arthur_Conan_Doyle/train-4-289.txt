‘The bearing of the weight of your harness, young man,’ Saxon answered
gravely, ‘is one of the exercises of war, and as such only attainable by
such practice as you are now undergoing. You have many things to learn,
and one of them is not to present petronels too readily at folk’s heads
when you are on horseback. The jerk of your charger’s movement even now
might have drawn your trigger, and so deprived Monmouth of an old and
tried soldier.’
