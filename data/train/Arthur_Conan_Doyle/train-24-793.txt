A very cheerful wood-fire was sputtering and cracking in an open grate
at the further end of the apartment. At one side of this fire, in a
high-backed oak chair, sat a lady, her face turned towards the door.
The firelight played over her features, and Alleyne thought that he had
never seen such queenly power, such dignity and strength, upon a woman's
face. She might have been five-and-thirty years of age, with aquiline
nose, firm yet sensitive mouth, dark curving brows, and deep-set eyes
which shone and sparkled with a shifting brilliancy. Beautiful as she
was, it was not her beauty which impressed itself upon the beholder;
it was her strength, her power, the sense of wisdom which hung over
the broad white brow, the decision which lay in the square jaw and
delicately moulded chin. A chaplet of pearls sparkled amid her black
hair, with a gauze of silver network flowing back from it over her
shoulders; a black mantle was swathed round her, and she leaned back in
her chair as one who is fresh from a journey.
