"It was like this. Walker had a fad about the portio dura--the motor to
the face, you know--and he thought paralysis of it came from a
disturbance of the blood supply. Something else which counterbalanced
that disturbance might, he thought, set it right again. We had a very
obstinate case of Bell's paralysis in the wards, and had tried it with
every conceivable thing, blistering, tonics, nerve-stretching,
galvanism, needles, but all without result. Walker got it into his head
that removal of the ear would increase the blood supply to the part, and
he very soon gained the consent of the patient to the operation.
