      â€œNever have I felt such a cold chill of disappointment, Watson.
      For a moment it seemed to me that there must be some radical
      mistake in my calculations. The setting sun shone full upon the
      passage floor, and I could see that the old, foot-worn grey
      stones with which it was paved were firmly cemented together, and
      had certainly not been moved for many a long year. Brunton had
      not been at work here. I tapped upon the floor, but it sounded
      the same all over, and there was no sign of any crack or crevice.
      But, fortunately, Musgrave, who had begun to appreciate the
      meaning of my proceedings, and who was now as excited as myself,
      took out his manuscript to check my calculation.
