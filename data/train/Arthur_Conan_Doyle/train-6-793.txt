“By Saint Paul! I had not thought of it.” “I was with you, hammering at the inner gate,” said Simon, “and yet
once when I thought that it was giving way I said in my heart: 'Good-by,
Samkin! I shall never see you more.' This Baron has gall in his
soul, even as I have myself, and do you think that I would give up my
prisoners alive, if I were constrained so to do? No, no; had we won our
way this day it would have been the death-stroke for them all.”
