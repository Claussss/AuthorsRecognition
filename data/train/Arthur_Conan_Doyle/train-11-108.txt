It thrilled me with horror, that terrible voice, but it thrilled me also
with hope, for it was the voice of a Frenchman. “Who is there?” I asked. There was a groaning, but no reply. “Is that you, Monsieur Hubert?” “Yes, yes,” sighed the voice, so low that I could hardly hear it.
“Water, water, for Heaven's sake, water!” I advanced in the direction of the sound, but only to come in contact
with the wall. Again I heard a groan, but this time there could be no
doubt that it was above my head. I put up my hands, but they felt only
empty air.
