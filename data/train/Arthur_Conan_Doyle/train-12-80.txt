“Not to-day,” said Robert, passing his hand over his forehead. “I feel
rather confused by all these wonders, and indeed I think that they have
affected my nerves a little. Besides, it is time that I returned to my
prosaic Elmdene, if I can find my way out of this wilderness to which
you have transplanted me. But would you ease my mind, Mr. Haw, by
showing me how this thing is done?” “It is the merest toy--a complex plaything, nothing more. Allow me to
explain. I have a line of very large greenhouses which extends from
one end of my smoking-room. These different houses are kept at varying
degrees of heat and humidity so as to reproduce the exact climates of
Egypt, China, and the rest. You see, our crystal chamber is a tramway
running with a minimum of friction along a steel rod. By pulling this or
that handle I regulate how far it shall go, and it travels, as you have
seen, with amazing speed. The effect of my hot-houses is heightened by
the roofs being invariably concealed by skies, which are really very
admirably painted, and by the introduction of birds and other creatures,
which seem to flourish quite as well in artificial as in natural heat.
This explains the South American effect.”
