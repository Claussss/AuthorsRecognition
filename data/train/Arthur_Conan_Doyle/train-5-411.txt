"It's all right," he said, throwing himself down in a chair.  "It was
that fool of a dog.  He had pushed the door open.  I don't know how I
came to forget to lock it." "I didn't know you kept a dog," said Smith, looking very thoughtfully
at the disturbed face of his companion. "Yes, I haven't had him long.  I must get rid of him.  He's a great
nuisance." "He must be, if you find it so hard to shut him up.  I should have
thought that shutting the door would have been enough, without locking
it."
