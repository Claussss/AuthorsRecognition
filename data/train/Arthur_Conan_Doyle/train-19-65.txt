Yes, perhaps there was, and very near me, too.  Charles Sadler must
know something of this!  His vague words of warning take a meaning now.
Oh, if I had only listened to him then, before I helped by these
repeated sittings to forge the links of the chain which binds me!  But
I will see him to-day.  I will apologize to him for having treated his
warning so lightly.  I will see if he can advise me. 4 P. M.  No, he cannot.  I have talked with him, and he showed such
surprise at the first words in which I tried to express my unspeakable
secret that I went no further.  As far as I can gather (by hints and
inferences rather than by any statement), his own experience was
limited to some words or looks such as I have myself endured.  His
abandonment of Miss Penclosa is in itself a sign that he was never
really in her toils.  Oh, if he only knew his escape!  He has to thank
his phlegmatic Saxon temperament for it.  I am black and Celtic, and
this hag's clutch is deep in my nerves.  Shall I ever get it out?
Shall I ever be the same man that I was just one short fortnight ago?
