Let me try to reason it out!  This woman, by her own explanation, can
dominate my nervous organism.  She can project herself into my body and
take command of it.  She has a parasite soul; yes, she is a parasite, a
monstrous parasite.  She creeps into my frame as the hermit crab does
into the whelk's shell.  I am powerless What can I do?  I am dealing
with forces of which I know nothing.  And I can tell no one of my
trouble.  They would set me down as a madman.  Certainly, if it got
noised abroad, the university would say that they had no need of a
devil-ridden professor.  And Agatha!  No, no, I must face it alone.
