April 12.  Yesterday was a blessed day of quiet, and I enjoyed an
uneventful night.  Wilson's presence is a great consolation.  What can
the woman do now?  Surely, when she has heard me say what I have said,
she will conceive the same disgust for me which I have for her.  She
could not, no, she COULD not, desire to have a lover who had insulted
her so.  No, I believe I am free from her love--but how about her hate?
Might she not use these powers of hers for revenge?  Tut! why should I
frighten myself over shadows?  She will forget about me, and I shall
forget about her, and all will be well.
