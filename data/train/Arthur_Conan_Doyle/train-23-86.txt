Enough has been said, perhaps, to show the reader that it is possible
to put forward a view of Christ's life which would be in strict accord
with the most modern psychic knowledge, and which, far from supplanting
Christianity, would show the surprising accuracy of some of the details
handed down to us, and would support the novel conclusion that those
very miracles, which have been the stumbling block to so many truthful,
earnest minds, may finally offer some very cogent arguments for the
truth of the whole narrative.  Is this then a line of thought which
merits the wholesale condemnations and anathemas hurled at it by those
who profess to speak in the name of religion?  At the same time, though
we bring support to the New Testament, it would, indeed, be a
misconception if these, or any such remarks, were quoted as sustaining
its literal accuracy--an idea from which so much harm has come in the
past.  It would, indeed, be a good, though an unattainable thing, that
a really honest and open-minded attempt should be made to weed out from
that record the obvious forgeries and interpolations which disfigure
it, and lessen the value of those parts which are really above
suspicion.
