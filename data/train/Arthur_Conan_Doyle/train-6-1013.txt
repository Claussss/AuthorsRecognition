of my own household, and I settle upon you five hundred marks of yearly
income from my own estates in England.” “Sir,” the knight answered, “God make me worthy of the good fortune you
bestow upon me. Your knight I will ever be, and the money I will divide
with your leave amongst these four squires who have brought me whatever
glory I have won this day.” So saying his head fell back, and he lay
white and silent upon the grass.
