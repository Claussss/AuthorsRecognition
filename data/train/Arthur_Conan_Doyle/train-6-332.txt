Nigel stood in front of a burnished shield which served as a mirror,
and he turned this way and that, preening himself like a little shining
bird. His smooth breastplate, his wondrous joints with their deft
protection by the disks at knee and elbow and shoulder, the
beautifully flexible gauntlets and sollerets, the shirt of mail and the
close-fitting greave-plates were all things of joy and of beauty in his
eyes. He sprang about the shop to show his lightness, and then running
out he placed his hand on the pommel and vaulted into Pommers' saddle,
while Wat and his boy applauded in the doorway.
