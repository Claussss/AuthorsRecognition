poison or what the cure.  But all that is known I know, for my father
was in this trade before me, and we have had much to do with these
poisoned weapons." "What are the symptoms?" "Deep sleep, and death in thirty hours." "And you say there is no cure.  Why then should you pay me this
considerable fee?"
