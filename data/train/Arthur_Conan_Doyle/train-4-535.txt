‘My orders are,’ said Saxon, riding up to us as we sat our horses reside
our companions, ‘that I and my captains should fall in with the King’s
escort as he passes, and so accompany him to the market-place. Your men
shall present arms, and shall then stand their ground until we return.’ We all three drew our swords and saluted. ‘If ye will come with me, gentlemen, and take position to the right of
the gate here,’ said he, ‘I may be able to tell ye something of these
folk as they pass. Thirty years of war in many climes should give me the
master craftsman’s right to expound to his apprentices.’
