The flight and pursuit had thundered far away, and the field was
deserted save for the numerous groups of weary horsemen who were making
their way back, driving their prisoners before them. The archers were
scattered over the whole plain, rifling the saddle-bags and gathering
the armor of those who had fallen, or searching for their own scattered
arrows. Suddenly, however, as the Prince was turning toward the bush which he
had chosen for his headquarters, there broke out from behind him an
extraordinary uproar and a group of knights and squires came pouring
toward him, all arguing, swearing and abusing each other in French and
English at the tops of their voices. In the midst of them limped a stout
little man in gold-spangled armor, who appeared to be the object of the
contention, for one would drag him one way and one another, as though
they would pull him limb from limb. “Nay, fair sirs, gently, gently, I
pray you!” he pleaded. “There is enough for all, and no need to treat me
so rudely.” But ever the hubbub broke out again, and swords gleamed as
the angry disputants glared furiously at each other. The Prince's eyes
fell upon the small prisoner, and he staggered back with a gasp of
astonishment.
