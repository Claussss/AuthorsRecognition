But must these sides of life be absolutely excluded? By no means.
Our decency need not weaken into prudery. It all lies in the spirit
in which it is done. No one who wished to lecture on these various
spirits could preach on a better text than these three great rivals,
Richardson, Fielding, and Smollett. It is possible to draw vice with
some freedom for the purpose of condemning it. Such a writer is a
moralist, and there is no better example than Richardson. Again, it
is possible to draw vice with neither sympathy nor disapprobation,
but simply as a fact which is there. Such a writer is a realist, and
such was Fielding. Once more, it is possible to draw vice in order
to extract amusement from it. Such a man is a coarse humorist, and
such was Smollett. Lastly, it is possible to draw vice in order to
show sympathy with it. Such a man is a wicked man, and there were
many among the writers of the Restoration. But of all reasons that
exist for treating this side of life, Richardson's were the best,
and nowhere do we find it more deftly done.
