      “You do yourself an injustice. The features are given to man as
      the means by which he shall express his emotions, and yours are
      faithful servants.”       “Do you mean to say that you read my train of thoughts from my
      features?”       “Your features and especially your eyes. Perhaps you cannot
      yourself recall how your reverie commenced?”       “No, I cannot.”       “Then I will tell you. After throwing down your paper, which was
      the action which drew my attention to you, you sat for half a
      minute with a vacant expression. Then your eyes fixed themselves
      upon your newly framed picture of General Gordon, and I saw by
      the alteration in your face that a train of thought had been
      started. But it did not lead very far. Your eyes flashed across
      to the unframed portrait of Henry Ward Beecher which stands upon
      the top of your books. Then you glanced up at the wall, and of
      course your meaning was obvious. You were thinking that if the
      portrait were framed it would just cover that bare space and
      correspond with Gordon’s picture over there.”
