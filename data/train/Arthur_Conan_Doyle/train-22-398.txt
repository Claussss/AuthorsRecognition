“I thought you'd be getting into trouble, Mr. Crooked McMurdo of
Chicago,” said he. “Can't keep out of it, can you? Take your hat and
come along with us.” “I guess you'll pay for this, Captain Marvin,” said McGinty. “Who are
you, I'd like to know, to break into a house in this fashion and molest
honest, law-abiding men?” “You're standing out in this deal, Councillor McGinty,” said the police
captain. “We are not out after you, but after this man McMurdo. It is
for you to help, not to hinder us in our duty.”
