“See, John,” she cried, “there is a light in Cloomber Tower!” I turned my head and stared back at the tall, white turret which peeped
out above the belt of trees. As I gazed I distinctly saw at one of the
windows the glint of a light, which suddenly vanished, and then shone
out once more from another higher up. There it flickered for some time,
and finally flashed past two successive windows underneath before the
trees obscured our view of it. It was clear that some one bearing a lamp
or a candle had climbed up the tower stairs and had then returned into
the body of the house.
