“With solid bars of gold, Robert. But come into the plantation and we
shall see what becomes of it.” They passed through the lodge gates, behind the waggon, and then
wandered off among the fir-trees until they gained a spot where they
could command a view. The load had halted, not in front of the house,
but at the door of the out-building with the chimney. A staff of
stablemen and footmen were in readiness, who proceeded to swiftly unload
and to carry the packages through the door. It was the first time that
Robert had ever seen any one save the master of the house enter the
laboratory. No sign was seen of him now, however, and in half an hour
the contents had all been safely stored and the waggon had driven
briskly away.
