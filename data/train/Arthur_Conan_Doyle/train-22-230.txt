â€œWell, gentlemen, the day before these happenings I was over in
Tunbridge Wells, and I got a glimpse of a man in the street. It was only
a glimpse; but I have a quick eye for these things, and I never doubted
who it was. It was the worst enemy I had among them all--one who has
been after me like a hungry wolf after a caribou all these years. I
knew there was trouble coming, and I came home and made ready for it. I
guessed I'd fight through it all right on my own, my luck was a proverb
in the States about '76. I never doubted that it would be with me still.
