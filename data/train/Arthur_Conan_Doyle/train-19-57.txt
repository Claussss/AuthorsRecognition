Last night was worse than before.  Instead of flying I actually sat for
some time with my hand in hers talking over the most intimate subjects
with her.  We spoke of Agatha, among other things.  What could I have
been dreaming of?  Miss Penclosa said that she was conventional, and I
agreed with her.  She spoke once or twice in a disparaging way of her,
and I did not protest.  What a creature I have been!
