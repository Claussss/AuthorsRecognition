But in spite of his words, they stood stock-still, in a huddled group,
staring out over the plain. Their nerves were numbed by the sudden
shock, and to all of them it was like a scene in a dream, vague,
impersonal, and unreal. The men upon the camels had streamed out from a
gorge which lay a mile or so distant on the side of the path along which
they had travelled. Their retreat, therefore, was entirely cut off. It
appeared, from the dust and the length of the line, to be quite an army
which was emerging from the hills, for seventy men upon camels cover
a considerable stretch of ground. Having reached the sandy plain, they
very deliberately formed to the front, and then at the harsh call of
a bugle they trotted forward in line, the parti-coloured figures all
swaying and the sand smoking in a rolling yellow cloud at the heels of
their camels. At the same moment the six black soldiers doubled in
from the front with their Martinis at the trail, and snuggled down like
well-trained skirmishers behind the rocks upon the haunch of the hill.
Their breech-blocks all snapped together as their corporal gave them the
order to load.
