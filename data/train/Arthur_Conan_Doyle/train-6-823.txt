It was a great vaulted chamber, brightly lit by many torches. At the
farther end roared a great fire. In front of it three naked men were
chained to posts in such a way that flinch as they might they could
never get beyond the range of its scorching heat. Yet they were so far
from it that no actual burn would be inflicted if they could but keep
turning and shifting so as continually to present some fresh portion of
their flesh to the flames. Hence they danced and whirled in front of the
fire, tossing ceaselessly this way and that within the compass of their
chains, wearied to death, their protruding tongues cracked and blackened
with thirst, but unable for one instant to rest from their writhings and
contortions.
