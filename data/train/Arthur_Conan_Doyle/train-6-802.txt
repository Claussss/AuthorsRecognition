“This man,” said Simon, “was once rich and of good repute, but he was
beggared by this robber lord, who afterwards put out his eyes so that he
has lived for many years in darkness at the charity of others.” “How can he help us in our enterprise if he be indeed blind?” asked
Nigel. “It is for that very reason, fair lord, that he can be of greater
service than any other man,” Simon answered; “for it often happens that
when a man has lost a sense the good God will strengthen those that
remain. Hence it is that Andreas has such ears that he can hear the sap
in the trees or the cheep of the mouse in its burrow. He has come to
help us to find the tunnel.”
