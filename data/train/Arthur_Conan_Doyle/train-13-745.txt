      It was seven o’clock when I awoke, and I set off at once for
      Phelps’s room, to find him haggard and spent after a sleepless
      night. His first question was whether Holmes had arrived yet.       “He’ll be here when he promised,” said I, “and not an instant
      sooner or later.”       And my words were true, for shortly after eight a hansom dashed
      up to the door and our friend got out of it. Standing in the
      window we saw that his left hand was swathed in a bandage and
      that his face was very grim and pale. He entered the house, but
      it was some little time before he came upstairs.
