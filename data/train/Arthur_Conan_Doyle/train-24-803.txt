“And perhaps, most honored sir, it would please you to continue the
debate. Perhaps you would condescend to go farther into the matter.

four-and-sixty quarterings, and I have been present at some bickerings

your name upon my tablets,” said Sir Bertrand. “There are many who wish
to advance themselves, and who bide their turn, for I refuse no man who
comes on such an errand. At present it may not be, for mine arm is stiff
from this small touch, and I would fain do you full honor when we cross
swords again. Come in with me, and let your squires come also, that my
sweet spouse, the Lady Tiphaine, may say that she hath seen so famed and
gentle a knight.”
