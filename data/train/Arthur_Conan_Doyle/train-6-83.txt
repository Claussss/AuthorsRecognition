Dame Ermyntrude Loring, daughter, wife, and mother of warriors, was
herself a formidable figure. Tall and gaunt, with hard craggy features
and intolerant dark eyes, even her snow-white hair and stooping back
could not entirely remove the sense of fear which she inspired in those
around her. Her thoughts and memories went back to harsher times, and
she looked upon the England around her as a degenerate and effeminate
land which had fallen away from the old standard of knightly courtesy
and valor.
