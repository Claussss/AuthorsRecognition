      “You say, Watson, that the lady is not there?” Holmes asked when
      I had finished my report.       “No.”       “Where can she be, then, since there is no light in any other
      room except the kitchen?”       “I cannot think where she is.”       I have said that over the great Grimpen Mire there hung a dense,
      white fog. It was drifting slowly in our direction and banked
      itself up like a wall on that side of us, low but thick and well
      defined. The moon shone on it, and it looked like a great
      shimmering ice-field, with the heads of the distant tors as rocks
      borne upon its surface. Holmes’s face was turned towards it, and
      he muttered impatiently as he watched its sluggish drift.
