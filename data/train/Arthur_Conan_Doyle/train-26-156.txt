It must be admitted that, looking back upon history, we have not
always been good allies, nor yet generous co-partners in the
battlefield. The first is the fault of our politics, where one party
rejoices to break what the other has bound. The makers of the Treaty
are staunch enough, as the Tories were under Pitt and Castlereagh,
or the Whigs at the time of Queen Anne, but sooner or later the
others must come in. At the end of the Marlborough wars we suddenly
vamped up a peace and, left our allies in the lurch, on account
of a change in domestic politics. We did the same with Frederick
the Great, and would have done it in the Napoleonic days if Fox
could have controlled the country. And as to our partners of the
battlefield, how little we have ever said that is hearty as to the
splendid staunchness of the Prussians at Waterloo. You have to read
the Frenchman, Houssaye, to get a central view and to understand
the part they played. Think of old Blucher, seventy years old, and
ridden over by a regiment of charging cavalry the day before, yet
swearing that he would come to Wellington if he had to be strapped
to his horse. He nobly redeemed his promise.
