of the old New England lady, who absolutely refused even to show any

to Baal,” she said. The most that she would concede was that she would
not openly interfere with anything which her companions might say or do. “And who is to argue with the priest?” asked Fardet, as they all rode
together, talking the matter over. “It is very important that it should
be done in a natural way, for if he thought that we were only trying to
gain time he would refuse to have any more to say to us.”
