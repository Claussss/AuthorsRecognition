“Nay, nay, I have been happy here with you at Tilford.” “We are very poor, Nigel. I do not know where we may find the money
to fit you for the wars. Yet we have good friends. There is Sir John
Chandos, who has won such credit in the French wars and who rides ever
by the King's bridle-arm. He was your father's friend and they were
Squires together. If I sent you to court with a message to him he would
do what he could.”
