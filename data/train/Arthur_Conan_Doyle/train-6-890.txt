Some, however, were beyond all aid. Croquart had cut at a Breton knight
named Jean Rousselot and had shorn away his shoulder-piece, exposing
his neck and the upper part of his arm. Vainly he tried to cover this
vulnerable surface with his shield. It was his right side, and he could
not stretch it far enough across, nor could he get away on account of
the press of men around him. For a time he held his foemen at bay, but
that bare patch of white shoulder was a mark for every weapon, until at
last a hatchet sank up to the socket in the knight's chest. Almost at
the same moment a second Breton, a young Squire named Geoffrey Mellon,
was slain by a thrust from Black Simon which found the weak spot beneath
the armpit. Three other Bretons, Evan Cheruel, Caro de Bodegat, and
Tristan de Pestivien, the first two knights and the latter a squire,
became separated from their comrades, and were beaten to the ground
with English all around them, so that they had to choose between instant
death and surrender. They handed their swords to Bambro' and stood
apart, each of them sorely wounded, watching with hot and bitter hearts
the melee which still surged up and down the field.
