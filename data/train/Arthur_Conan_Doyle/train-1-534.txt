'Your Honours make some observations of a negative character upon
the object with which these preparations were made. I do not think it

the British Empire has been compelled to confront an invasion which has
entailed a costly war and the loss of thousands of precious lives. This
great calamity has been the penalty which Great Britain has suffered for
having in recent years acquiesced in the existence of the two Republics.
