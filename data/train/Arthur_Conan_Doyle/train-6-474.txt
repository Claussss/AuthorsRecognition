It was but a dim and distant white cloud upon the blue water seen far
off over the Dungeness Point, and yet the sight of it flushed the young
Squire's cheeks and sent the blood hot through his veins. It was the
fringe of France, that land of chivalry and glory, the stage where name
and fame were to be won. With burning eyes he gazed across at it, his
heart rejoicing to think that the hour was at hand when he might tread
that sacred soil. Then his gaze crossed the immense stretch of the blue
sea, dotted over with the sails of fishing-boats, until it rested upon
the double harbor beneath packed with vessels of every size and shape,
from the pessoners and creyers which plied up and down the coast to
the great cogs and galleys which were used either as war-ships or
merchantmen as the occasion served. One of them was at that instant
passing out to sea, a huge galleass, with trumpets blowing and nakers
banging, the flag of Saint George flaunting over the broad purple sail,
and the decks sparkling from end to end with steel. Nigel gave a cry of
pleasure at the splendor of the sight.
