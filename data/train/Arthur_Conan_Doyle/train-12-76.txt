The sofa in question was in a niche which was lined in three sides and
above with perfectly clear transparent crystal. As they sat down the
master of the house drew a cord which pulled out a crystal shutter
behind them, so that they were enclosed on all sides in a great box
of glass, so pure and so highly polished that its presence might very
easily be forgotten. A number of golden cords with crystal handles hung
down into this small chamber, and appeared to be connected with a long
shining bar outside.
