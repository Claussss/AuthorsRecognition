      “Yes, he did.”       “When did he say this?”       “When he left me.”       “Did he say anything more?”       “He mentioned his name.”       Holmes cast a swift glance of triumph at me. “Oh, he mentioned
      his name, did he? That was imprudent. What was the name that he
      mentioned?”       “His name,” said the cabman, “was Mr. Sherlock Holmes.”       Never have I seen my friend more completely taken aback than by
      the cabman’s reply. For an instant he sat in silent amazement.
      Then he burst into a hearty laugh.
