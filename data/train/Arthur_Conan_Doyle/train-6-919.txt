But France, even with her southwestern corner in English hands, was
still a very warlike power, far richer and more populous than her rival.
Single Provinces were so great that they were stronger than many a
kingdom. Normandy in the north, Burgundy in the east, Brittany in the
west and Languedoc in the south were each capable of fitting out a great
army of their own. Therefore the brave and spirited John, watching from
Paris this insolent raid into his dominions, sent messengers in hot
haste to all these great feudatories as well as to Lorraine, Picardy,
Auvergne, Hainault, Vermandois, Champagne, and to the German mercenaries
over his eastern border, bidding all of them to ride hard, with bloody
spur, day and night, until they should gather to a head at Chartres.
