  "He looked me all over with a warlike eye, and I could see the
  challenge on his lips." What could be more vivid than the effect produced by such sentences
as these? There is much more that might be said as to Stevenson's peculiar and
original methods in fiction. As a minor point, it might be remarked
that he is the inventor of what may be called the mutilated villain.
It is true that Mr. Wilkie Collins has described one gentleman
who had not only been deprived of all his limbs, but was further
afflicted by the insupportable name of Miserrimus Dexter. Stevenson,
however, has used the effect so often, and with such telling
results, that he may be said to have made it his own. To say nothing
of Hyde, who was the very impersonation of deformity, there is the
horrid blind Pew, Black Dog with two fingers missing, Long John with
his one leg, and the sinister catechist who is blind but shoots by
ear, and smites about him with his staff. In "The Black Arrow," too,
there is another dreadful creature who comes tapping along with a
stick. Often as he has used the device, he handles it so artistically
that it never fails to produce its effect.
