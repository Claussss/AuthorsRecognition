That night the English lay thick round the fortress of La Brohiniere so
that none might come forth from it. But if none could come forth it was
hard to see how any could win their way in, for it was full of men, the
walls were high and strong, and a deep dry ditch girt it round. But the
hatred and fear which its master had raised over the whole country-side
could now be plainly seen, for during the night the brushwood men and
the villagers came in from all parts with offers of such help as they
could give for the intaking of the castle. Knolles set them cutting
bushes and tying them into fagots. When morning came he rode out before
the wall and he held counsel with his knights and squires as to how he
should enter in.
