April 7.  Have stayed away as I said.  It is a pity to ruin such an
interesting investigation, but it would be a greater pity still to ruin
my life, and I KNOW that I cannot trust myself with that woman. 11 P. M.  God help me!  What is the matter with me?  Am I going mad?
Let me try and be calm and reason with myself.  First of all I shall
set down exactly what occurred. It was nearly eight when I wrote the lines with which this day begins.
Feeling strangely restless and uneasy, I left my rooms and walked round
to spend the evening with Agatha and her mother.  They both remarked
that I was pale and haggard.  About nine Professor Pratt-Haldane came
in, and we played a game of whist.  I tried hard to concentrate my
attention upon the cards, but the feeling of restlessness grew and grew
until I found it impossible to struggle against it.  I simply COULD not
sit still at the table.  At last, in the very middle of a hand, I threw
my cards down and, with some sort of an incoherent apology about having
an appointment, I rushed from the room.  As if in a dream I have a
vague recollection of tearing through the hall, snatching my hat from
the stand, and slamming the door behind me.  As in a dream, too, I have
the impression of the double line of gas-lamps, and my bespattered
boots tell me that I must have run down the middle of the road.  It was
all misty and strange and unnatural.  I came to Wilson's house; I saw
Mrs. Wilson and I saw Miss Penclosa.  I hardly recall what we talked
about, but I do remember that Miss P.  shook the head of her crutch at
me in a playful way, and accused me of being late and of losing
interest in our experiments.  There was no mesmerism, but I stayed some
time and have only just returned.
