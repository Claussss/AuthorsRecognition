"There's no need for fiction in medicine," remarks Foster, "for the
facts will always beat anything you can fancy.  But it has seemed to me
sometimes that a curious paper might be read at some of these meetings
about the uses of medicine in popular fiction." "Well, of what the folk die of, and what diseases are made most use of
in novels.  Some are worn to pieces, and others, which are equally
common in real life, are never mentioned.  Typhoid is fairly frequent,
but scarlet fever is unknown.  Heart disease is common, but then heart
disease, as we know it, is usually the sequel of some foregoing
disease, of which we never hear anything in the romance.  Then there is
the mysterious malady called brain fever, which always attacks the
heroine after a crisis, but which is unknown under that name to the
text books.  People when they are over-excited in novels fall down in a
fit.  In a fairly large experience I have never known anyone do so in
real life.  The small complaints simply don't exist.  Nobody ever gets
shingles or quinsy, or mumps in a novel.  All the diseases, too, belong
to the upper part of the body.  The novelist never strikes below the
belt."
