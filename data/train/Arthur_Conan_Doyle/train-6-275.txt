Such ventures as these where an aspirant for fame would wait for days at
a cross-road, a ford, or a bridge, until some worthy antagonist should
ride that way, were very common in the old days of adventurous knight
erranty, and were still familiar to the minds of all men because the
stories of the romancers and the songs of the trouveres were full of
such incidents. Their actual occurrence however had become rare. There
was the more curiosity, not unmixed with amusement, in the thoughts
of the courtiers as they watched Chandos ride down to the bridge and
commented upon the somewhat singular figure of the challenger. His build
was strange, and so also was his figure, for the limbs were short for so
tall a man. His head also was sunk forward as if he were lost in thought
or overcome with deep dejection.
