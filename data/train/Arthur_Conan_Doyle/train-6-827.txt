In a corner lay Aylward, dripping from his barrel and exhausted with
cold and hunger. Nigel ran to his side and raised his head. The jug of
wine from which the two jailers had drunk still stood upon their table.
The Squire placed it to the archer's lips and he took a hearty pull at
it. “How is it with you now, Aylward?” “Better, Squire, better, but may I never touch water again as long as I
live! Alas! poor Dicon has gone, and Stephen also--the life chilled out
of them. The cold is in the very marrow of my bones. I pray you, let me
lean upon your arm as far as the fire, that I may warm the frozen blood
and set it running in my veins once more.”
