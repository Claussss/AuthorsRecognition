“Your plans are certainly stupendous,” said Robert, uncertain whether to
laugh or to be awe-struck. “You will cease to be a man, and become one
of the great forces of Nature, altering, moulding, and improving.” “That is precisely the view which I take of myself. That is why I feel
my responsibility so acutely.” “But surely if you will do all this you may rest. It is a considerable
programme.” “Not at all. I am a patriotic Briton, and I should like to do something
to leave my name in the annals of my country. I should prefer, however,
to do it after my own death, as anything in the shape of publicity and
honour is very offensive to me. I have, therefore, put by eight hundred
million in a place which shall be duly mentioned in my will, which I
propose to devote to paying off the National Debt. I cannot see that any
harm could arise from its extinction.”
