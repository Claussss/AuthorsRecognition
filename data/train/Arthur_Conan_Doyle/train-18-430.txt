For my own part, I have no idea now, looking back, what goal it was
which I expected to reach at the end of our pursuit. I can remember that
my mind was full of the vaguest and most varying speculations. Could it be that the three Buddhists had had a craft in readiness off
the coast, and had embarked with their prisoners for the East? The
direction of their track seemed at first to favour this supposition,
for it lay in the line of the upper end of the bay, but it ended by
branching off and striking directly inland. Clearly the ocean was not to
be our terminus.
