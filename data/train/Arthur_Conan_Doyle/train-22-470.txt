“Eminent Bodymaster,” he said, in a solemn voice, “I claim urgency!” “Brother McMurdo claims urgency,” said McGinty. “It's a claim that by
the rules of this lodge takes precedence. Now Brother, we attend you.” McMurdo took the letter from his pocket. “Eminent Bodymaster and Brethren,” he said, “I am the bearer of ill news
this day; but it is better that it should be known and discussed, than
that a blow should fall upon us without warning which would destroy us
all. I have information that the most powerful and richest organizations
in this state have bound themselves together for our destruction, and
that at this very moment there is a Pinkerton detective, one Birdy
Edwards, at work in the valley collecting the evidence which may put a
rope round the necks of many of us, and send every man in this room into
a felon's cell. That is the situation for the discussion of which I have
made a claim of urgency.”
