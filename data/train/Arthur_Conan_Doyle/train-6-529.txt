But Badding, Masters the archer and he had been hustled back to the
bulwark and were barely holding their own from minute to minute against
the fierce crowd who assailed them, when an arrow coming apparently from
the sea struck the foremost Frenchman to the heart. A moment later a
boat dashed up alongside and four more men from the Marie Rose scrambled
on to the blood-stained deck. With one fierce rush the remaining
Frenchmen were struck down or were seized by their assailants. Nine
prostrate men upon the deck showed how fierce had been the attack, how
desperate the resistance.
