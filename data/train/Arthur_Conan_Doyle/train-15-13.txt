"Well?" asked the Governor. "We are here," said Celticus boldly, "as the spokesmen of a great number
of our fellow-countrymen, for the purpose of sending our petition
through you to the Emperor and to the Roman Senate, that we may urge
upon them the policy of allowing us to govern this country after our
own ancient fashion." He paused, as if awaiting some outburst as an
answer to his own temerity; but the Governor merely nodded his head as a
sign that he should proceed. "We had laws of our own before ever CÃ¦sar
set foot in Britain, which have served their purpose since first our
forefathers came from the land of Ham. We are not a child among the
nations, but our history goes back in our own traditions further even
than that of Rome, and we are galled by this yoke which you have laid
upon us."
