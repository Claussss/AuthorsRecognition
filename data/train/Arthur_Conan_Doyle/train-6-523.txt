“Enough!” cried Badding. “One is down, and it may be two. Close in,
close in, in God's name, before they rally!” He and the other bent to their oars; but at the same instant there was
a sharp zip in the air and a hard clear sound like a stone striking a
wall. Baddlesmere clapped his hand to his head, groaned and fell forward
out of the boat, leaving a swirl of blood upon the surface. A moment
later the same fierce hiss ended in a loud wooden crash, and a short,
thick crossbow-bolt was buried deep in the side of their boat.
