      “You are aware, Mr. Holmes, that our college doors are double—a
      green baize one within and a heavy oak one without. As I
      approached my outer door, I was amazed to see a key in it. For an
      instant I imagined that I had left my own there, but on feeling
      in my pocket I found that it was all right. The only duplicate
      which existed, so far as I knew, was that which belonged to my
      servant, Bannister—a man who has looked after my room for ten
      years, and whose honesty is absolutely above suspicion. I found
      that the key was indeed his, that he had entered my room to know
      if I wanted tea, and that he had very carelessly left the key in
      the door when he came out. His visit to my room must have been
      within a very few minutes of my leaving it. His forgetfulness
      about the key would have mattered little upon any other occasion,
      but on this one day it has produced the most deplorable
      consequences.
