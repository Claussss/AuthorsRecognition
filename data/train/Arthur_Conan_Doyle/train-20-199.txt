      “I think I have known how to frame the letter,” said Sherlock
      Holmes. “In fact, if I am not very much mistaken, here is the
      gentleman himself coming up the drive.”       A man was striding up the path which led to the door. He was a
      tall, handsome, swarthy fellow, clad in a suit of grey flannel,
      with a Panama hat, a bristling black beard, and a great,
      aggressive hooked nose, and flourishing a cane as he walked. He
      swaggered up a path as if the place belonged to him, and we heard
      his loud, confident peal at the bell.
