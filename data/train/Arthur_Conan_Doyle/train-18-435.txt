There was no difficulty about picking our way through the morass, for
wherever the five could go we three could follow. If we could have had any doubts as to our dog's guidance they would
all have been removed now, for in the soft, black, oozing soil we could
distinctly trace the tracks of the whole party. From these we could
see that they had walked abreast, and, furthermore, that each was about
equidistant from the other. Clearly, then, no physical force had been
used in taking the general and his companion along. The compulsion had
been psychical and not material.
