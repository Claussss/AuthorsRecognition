‘It is not a matter which I shall discuss, save at a more fitting time
and place,’ Reuben answered quietly. ‘Do you give over your sword and
come back with us. For my part, I promise to do what I can to save your
life. Should we win this night, your poor efforts can do little to harm
us. Should we lose, there may be few of us left to harm.’ ‘I thank you for your kindly protection,’ he replied, in the same white,
cold, bitter manner, unbuckling his sword as he spoke, and walking
slowly up to my companion. ‘You can take this as a gift to Mistress
Ruth,’ he said, presenting the weapon in his left hand, ‘and this!’ he
added, plucking a knife from his belt and burying it in my poor friend’s
side.
