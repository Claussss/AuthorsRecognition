      “It’s charcoal,” he cried. “Give it time. It will clear.”       Peering in, we could see that the only light in the room came
      from a dull blue flame which flickered from a small brass tripod
      in the centre. It threw a livid, unnatural circle upon the floor,
      while in the shadows beyond we saw the vague loom of two figures
      which crouched against the wall. From the open door there reeked
      a horrible poisonous exhalation which set us gasping and
      coughing. Holmes rushed to the top of the stairs to draw in the
      fresh air, and then, dashing into the room, he threw up the
      window and hurled the brazen tripod out into the garden.
