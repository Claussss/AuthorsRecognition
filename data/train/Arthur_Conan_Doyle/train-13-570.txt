      “That is what we have to find out.”       “How could they get in?”       “Through the front door.”       “It was barred in the morning.”       “Then it was barred after them.”       “How do you know?”       “I saw their traces. Excuse me a moment, and I may be able to
      give you some further information about it.”       He went over to the door, and turning the lock he examined it in
      his methodical way. Then he took out the key, which was on the
      inside, and inspected that also. The bed, the carpet, the chairs
      the mantelpiece, the dead body, and the rope were each in turn
      examined, until at last he professed himself satisfied, and with
      my aid and that of the inspector cut down the wretched object and
      laid it reverently under a sheet.
