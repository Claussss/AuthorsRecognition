As far as the Shalford crossing Sir John rode by Nigel's arm, and many
were the last injunctions which he gave him concerning woodcraft, and
great his anxiety lest he confuse a spay with a brocket, or either with
a hind. At last when they came to the reedy edge of the Wey the old
knight and his daughter reined up their horses. Nigel looked back at
them ere he entered the dark Chantry woods, and saw them still gazing
after him and waving their hands. Then the path wound amongst the trees
and they were lost to sight; but long afterwards when a clearing exposed
once more the Shalford meadows Nigel saw that the old man upon the gray
cob was riding slowly toward Saint Catharine's Hill, but that the girl
was still where he had seen her last, leaning forward in her saddle and
straining her eyes to pierce the dark forest which screened her lover
from her view. It was but a fleeting glance through a break in the
foliage, and yet in after days of stress and toil in far distant lands
it was that one little picture--the green meadow, the reeds, the slow
blue-winding river, and the eager bending graceful figure upon the white
horse--which was the clearest and the dearest image of that England
which he had left behind him.
