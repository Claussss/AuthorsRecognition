“It is Andreas,” cried West-country Will. “He has slain him.” “Then it was he that I heard behind us,” said Nigel. “Doubtless he was
at our very heels in the darkness. I fear that the priest's cry has been
heard.” “Nay,” said Simon, “there are so many cries that one more may well pass.
Let us take this lamp from the wall and see what sort of devil's den we
have around us.” They opened the door upon the right, and so horrible a smell issued from
it that they were driven back from it. The lamp which Simon held forward
showed a monkeylike creature mowing and grimacing in the corner, man or
woman none could tell, but driven crazy by loneliness and horror. In the
other cell was a graybearded man fettered to the wall, looking blankly
before him, a body without a soul, yet with life still in him, for his
dull eyes turned slowly in their direction. But it was from behind the
central door at the end of the passage that the chorus of sad cries came
which filled the air.
