But the good guardian angel did not desert me. Quick as a flash there came into my memory the name of the general who
commanded the advance of the Prussians. 
{illust. caption = “There is Marshal Blucher. Deliver your message!”} 
“General Bulow!” I cried. The Uhlan let go my bridle. “General Bulow!
General Bulow!” I shouted, as every stride of the dear little mare took
me nearer my own people. Through the burning village of Planchenoit
I galloped, spurred my way between two columns of Prussian infantry,
sprang over a hedge, cut down a Silesian Hussar who flung himself before
me, and an instant afterward, with my coat flying open to show the
uniform below, I passed through the open files of the tenth of the line,
and was back in the heart of Lobau's corps once more. Outnumbered and
outflanked, they were being slowly driven in by the pressure of the
Prussian advance. I galloped onward, anxious only to find myself by the
Emperor's side.
