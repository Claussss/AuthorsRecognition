“Quite so. But, in the second place, why did you not come at once?” Holmes glanced at his watch. “It is a quarter-past two,” he said. “Your telegram was dispatched
about one. But no one can glance at your toilet and attire without
seeing that your disturbance dates from the moment of your waking.” Our client smoothed down his unbrushed hair and felt his unshaven chin. “You are right, Mr. Holmes. I never gave a thought to my toilet. I was
only too glad to get out of such a house. But I have been running round
making inquiries before I came to you. I went to the house agents, you
know, and they said that Mr. Garcia’s rent was paid up all right and
that everything was in order at Wisteria Lodge.”
