Chapter XXXI. Of the Maid of the Marsh and the Bubble which rose from
the Bog All Bridgewater was in a ferment as we rode in, for King Jamesâ€™s forces
were within four miles, on the Sedgemoor Plain, and it was likely that
they would push on at once and storm the town. Some rude works had been
thrown up on the Eastover side, behind which two brigades were drawn
up in arms, while the rest of the army was held in reserve in the
market-place and Castle Field. Towards afternoon, however, parties of
our horse and peasants from the fen country came in with the news that
there was no fear of an assault being attempted. The Royal troops had
quartered themselves snugly in the little villages of the neighbourhood,
and having levied contributions of cider and of beer from the farmers,
they showed no sign of any wish to advance.
