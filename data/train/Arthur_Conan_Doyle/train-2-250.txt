â€œShould I appeal to the law? Where were my proofs? I knew that the
facts were true, but could I help to make a jury of countrymen believe
so fantastic a story? I might or I might not. But I could not afford to
fail. My soul cried out for revenge. I have said to you once before,
Mr. Holmes, that I have spent much of my life outside the law, and that
I have come at last to be a law to myself. So it was even now. I
determined that the fate which he had given to others should be shared
by himself. Either that or I would do justice upon him with my own
hand. In all England there can be no man who sets less value upon his
own life than I do at the present moment.
