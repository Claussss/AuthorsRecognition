This extract contains some account of the events of the first week of
October of that year, including the skirmish of the Terada ravine and
the death of the man Ghoolab Shah. I have the narrative lying before me now, and I copy it verbatim. If it
contains some matter which has no direct bearing upon the question
at issue, I can only say that I thought it better to publish what is
irrelevant than by cutting and clipping to lay the whole statement open
to the charge of having been tampered with.
