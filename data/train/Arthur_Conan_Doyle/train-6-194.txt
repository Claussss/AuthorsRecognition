They had passed over the wild moors and had come down now into the main
road by which the pilgrims from the west of England made their way to
the national shrine at Canterbury. It passed from Winchester, and up the
beautiful valley of the Itchen until it reached Farnham, where it forked
into two branches, one of which ran along the Hog's Back, while the
second wound to the south and came out at Saint Catherine's Hill where
stands the Pilgrim shrine, a gray old ruin now, but once so august, so
crowded and so affluent. It was this second branch upon which Nigel and
Aylward found themselves as they rode to Guildford.
