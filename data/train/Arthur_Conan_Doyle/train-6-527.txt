The crossbowman stood under the mast, his terrible weapon at his
shoulder, the steel string stretched taut, the heavy bolt shining upon
the nut. One life at least he would claim out of this little band. Just
for one instant too long did he dwell upon his aim, shifting from the
seaman to Cock Badding, whose formidable appearance showed him to be the
better prize. In that second of time Hal Masters' string twanged and his
long arrow sped through the arbalister's throat. He dropped on the deck,
with blood and curses pouring from his mouth.
