      “So you have. You look remarkably robust.”       “How, then, did you know of it?”       “My dear fellow, you know my methods.”       “You deduced it, then?”       “Certainly.”       “And from what?”       “From your slippers.”       I glanced down at the new patent leathers which I was wearing.
      “How on earth—” I began, but Holmes answered my question before
      it was asked.       “Your slippers are new,” he said. “You could not have had them
      more than a few weeks. The soles which you are at this moment
      presenting to me are slightly scorched. For a moment I thought
      they might have got wet and been burned in the drying. But near
      the instep there is a small circular wafer of paper with the
      shopman’s hieroglyphics upon it. Damp would of course have
      removed this. You had, then, been sitting with your feet
      outstretched to the fire, which a man would hardly do even in so
      wet a June as this if he were in his full health.”
