What a load of moral responsibility upon one man! But his mind was
insensible to moral responsibility. Surely if it had not been it
must have been crushed beneath it. Now, if you want to understand
the character of Napoleon--but surely I must take a fresh start
before I launch on so portentous a subject as that. But before I leave the military men let me, for the credit of my own
country, after that infamous incident of the letters, indicate these
six well-thumbed volumes of "Napier's History." This is the story of
the great Peninsular War, by one who fought through it himself, and
in no history has a more chivalrous and manly account been given of
one's enemy. Indeed, Napier seems to me to push it too far, for his
admiration appears to extend not only to the gallant soldiers who
opposed him, but to the character and to the ultimate aims of their
leader. He was, in fact, a political follower of Charles James Fox,
and his heart seems to have been with the enemy even at the moment
when he led his men most desperately against them. In the verdict
of history the action of those men who, in their honest zeal for
freedom, inflamed somewhat by political strife, turned against their
own country, when it was in truth the Champion of Freedom, and
approved of a military despot of the most uncompromising kind, seems
wildly foolish.
