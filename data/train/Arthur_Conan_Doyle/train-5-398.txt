"I don't know his name," said Bellingham, passing his hand over the
shrivelled head.  "You see the outer sarcophagus with the inscriptions
is missing.  Lot 249 is all the title he has now.  You see it printed
on his case.  That was his number in the auction at which I picked him
up." "He has been a very pretty sort of fellow in his day," remarked
Abercrombie Smith. "He has been a giant.  His mummy is six feet seven in length, and that
would be a giant over there, for they were never a very robust race.
Feel these great knotted bones, too.  He would be a nasty fellow to
tackle."
