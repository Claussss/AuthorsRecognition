The youth sprang as far as the rope would allow him, and slipped it half
over his face in the effort. Three arrows flashed past his side, and
two of them buried themselves in the body of the man behind. A howl of
delight burst from the spectators as he dropped first upon his knees and
then upon his face. A life for a life was no bad bargain. But it was only a short respite which the skill of his comrades had
given to the young archer. Over the parapet there appeared a ball of
brass, then a pair of great brazen shoulders, and lastly the full figure
of an armored man. He walked to the edge and they heard his hoarse
guffaw of laughter as the arrows clanged and clattered against his
impenetrable mail. He slapped his breast-plate, as he jeered at them.
Well he knew that at the distance no dart ever sped by mortal hands
could cleave through his plates of metal. So he stood, the great burly
Butcher of La Brohiniere, with head uptossed, laughing insolently at
his foes. Then with slow and ponderous tread he walked toward his boy
victim, seized him by the ear, and dragged him across so that the rope
might be straight. Seeing that the noose had slipped across the face,
he tried to push it down, but the mail glove hampering him he pulled it
off, and grasped the rope above the lad's head with his naked hand.
