Most of my books deal with the days of his greatness, but here, you
see, is a three-volume account of those weary years at St. Helena.
Who can help pitying the mewed eagle? And yet if you play the great
game you must pay a stake. This was the same man who had a royal
duke shot in a ditch because he was a danger to his throne. Was
not he himself a danger to every throne in Europe? Why so harsh a
retreat as St. Helena, you say? Remember that he had been put in a
milder one before, that he had broken away from it, and that the
lives of fifty thousand men had paid for the mistaken leniency.
All this is forgotten now, and the pathetic picture of the modern
Prometheus chained to his rock and devoured by the vultures of his
own bitter thoughts, is the one impression which the world has
retained. It is always so much easier to follow the emotions than
the reason, especially where a cheap magnanimity and second-hand
generosity are involved. But reason must still insist that Europe's
treatment of Napoleon was not vindictive, and that Hudson Lowe was
a man who tried to live up to the trust which had been committed to
him by his country.
