‘What then?’ I asked. ‘I am still in the dark.’ ‘Nay, it is surely plain enough to you now. Marot’s end was to baffle
his pursuers and to benefit the exiles. How could he do this better than
by engaging as a seaman aboard this brig, the _Dorothy Fox_, and sailing
away from England in her? There are but thirty of a crew. Below hatches
are close on two hundred men, who, simple as they may be, are, as you
and I know, second to none in the cut-and-thrust work, without order or
discipline, which will be needed in such an affair. Marot has but to go
down amongst them some dark night, knock off their anklets, and fit them
up with a few stanchions or cudgels. Ho, ho, Micah! what think you? The
planters may dig their plantations themselves for all the help they are
like to get from West countrymen this bout.’
