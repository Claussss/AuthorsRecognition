Our intention is to give out that we are going down the valley to meet
the convoy and to block the mouth of a pass from which we profess to
expect an attack. Very good. We shall make a night-march to-night and
reach their camp. Once there I shall conceal my two hundred men in the
waggons and travel up with the convoy again. Our friends the enemy, having heard that we intended to go south, and
seeing the caravan going north without us, will naturally swoop down
upon it under the impression that we are twenty miles away. We shall
teach them such a lesson that they would as soon think of stopping a
thunderbolt as of interfering again with one of Her Britannic Majesty's
provision trains. I am all on thorns to be off.
