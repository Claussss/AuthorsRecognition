Hark away, lads, with a loose rein and a bloody heel!â€™ We spurred our steeds and galloped from the unholy spot as fast as our
brave beasts could carry us. To all of us the air had a purer flavour
and the heath a sweeter scent by contrast with the grim couple whom we
had left behind us. What a sweet world would this be, my children, were
it not for man and his cruel ways! When we at last pulled up we had set some three or four miles between
the gibbet and ourselves. Right over against us, on the side of a gentle
slope, stood a bright little village, with a red-roofed church rising up
from amidst a clump of trees. To our eyes, after the dull sward of the
plain, it was a glad sight to see the green spread of the branches and
the pleasant gardens which girt the hamlet round. All morning we had
seen no sight of a human being, save the old hag upon the moor and a few
peat-cutters in the distance. Our belts, too, were beginning to be loose
upon us, and the remembrance of our breakfast more faint.
