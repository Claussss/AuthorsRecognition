      “Excellent, Watson!” cried Holmes. “I really fancy that you are
      not far from the truth. You see that we hold all the cards, and
      we have only to fear some sudden act of violence on their part.
      If they give us time we must have them.”       “But how can we find where this house lies?”       “Well, if our conjecture is correct and the girl’s name is or was
      Sophy Kratides, we should have no difficulty in tracing her. That
      must be our main hope, for the brother is, of course, a complete
      stranger. It is clear that some time has elapsed since this
      Harold established these relations with the girl—some weeks, at
      any rate—since the brother in Greece has had time to hear of it
      and come across. If they have been living in the same place
      during this time, it is probable that we shall have some answer
      to Mycroft’s advertisement.”
