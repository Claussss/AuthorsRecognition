There was a pause after this, while the stranger drew a long knife from
his belt, and cleaned out his pipe with it. Reuben and I took up our
oars, and having pulled up our tangled fishing-lines, which had been
streaming behind the boat, we proceeded to pull in towards the land. ‘The question now is,’ said the stranger, ‘where we are to go to?’ ‘We are going down Langston Bay,’ I answered. ‘Oh, we are, are we?’ he cried, in a mocking voice; ‘you are sure of it
eh? You are certain we are not going to France? We have a mast and sail
there, I see, and water in the beaker. All we want are a few fish,
which I hear are plentiful in these waters, and we might make a push for
Barfleur.’
