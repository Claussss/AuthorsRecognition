How is this, for example, if you have an ear for the music of prose?
It is a simple paragraph out of the magnificent description of a
long calm in the tropics.   "A change, unusual as unwholesome, came over the bright blue
  of the sea. No longer did it reflect, as in a limpid mirror,
  the splendour of the sun, the sweet silvery glow of the
  moon, or the coruscating clusters of countless stars. Like
  the ashen-grey hue that bedims the countenance of the dying,
  a filmy greasy skin appeared to overspread the recent
  loveliness of the ocean surface. The sea was sick, stagnant,
  and foul, from its turbid waters arose a miasmatic vapour
  like a breath of decay, which clung clammily to the palate
  and dulled all the senses. Drawn by some strange force,
  from the unfathomable depths below, eerie shapes sought the
  surface, blinking glassily at the unfamiliar glare they had
  exchanged for their native gloom--uncouth creatures bedight
  with tasselled fringes like weed-growths waving around them,
  fathom-long, medusae with coloured spots like eyes clustering
  all over their transparent substance, wriggling worm-like
  forms of such elusive matter that the smallest exposure to
  the sun melted them, and they were not. Lower down, vast pale
  shadows creep sluggishly along, happily undistinguishable
  as yet, but adding a half-familiar flavour to the strange,
  faint smell that hung about us."
