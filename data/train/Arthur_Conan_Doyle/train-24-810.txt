It was indeed a singular scene which met their eyes. The room was a long
and lofty one, stone floored and bare, with a fire at the further end
upon which a great pot was boiling. A deal table ran down the centre,
with a wooden wine-pitcher upon it and two horn cups. Some way from it
was a smaller table with a single beaker and a broken wine-bottle. From
the heavy wooden rafters which formed the roof there hung rows of hooks
which held up sides of bacon, joints of smoked beef, and strings of
onions for winter use. In the very centre of all these, upon the
largest hook of all, there hung a fat little red-faced man with enormous
whiskers, kicking madly in the air and clawing at rafters, hams, and
all else that was within hand-grasp. The huge steel hook had been passed
through the collar of his leather jerkin, and there he hung like a fish
on a line, writhing, twisting, and screaming, but utterly unable to free
himself from his extraordinary position. It was not until Alleyne and
the landlord had mounted on the table that they were able to lift him
down, when he sank gasping with rage into a seat, and rolled his eyes
round in every direction.
