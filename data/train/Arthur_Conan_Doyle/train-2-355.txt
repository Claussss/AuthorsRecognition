“I want to know what you have done with the Lady Frances Carfax, whom
you brought away with you from Baden.” “I’d be very glad if you could tell me where that lady may be,” Peters
answered coolly. “I’ve a bill against her for nearly a hundred pounds,
and nothing to show for it but a couple of trumpery pendants that the
dealer would hardly look at. She attached herself to Mrs. Peters and me
at Baden—it is a fact that I was using another name at the time—and she
stuck on to us until we came to London. I paid her bill and her ticket.
Once in London, she gave us the slip, and, as I say, left these
out-of-date jewels to pay her bills. You find her, Mr. Holmes, and I’m
your debtor.”
