Meanwhile during that brief moment of exultation when the battle
appeared to be won, a crowd of hot-headed young knights and squires
swarmed and clamored round the Prince, beseeching that he would allow
them to ride forth. “See this insolent fellow who bears three martlets upon a field gales!”
 cried Sir Maurice Berkeley. “He stands betwixt the two armies as though
he had no dread of us.” “I pray you, sir, that I may ride out to him, since he seems ready to
attempt some small deed,” pleaded Nigel.
