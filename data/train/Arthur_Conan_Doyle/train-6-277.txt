The King raised his hand; there was a clang from the falconer's horn,
and the two riders, with a thrust of their heels and a shake of their
bridles, dashed furiously at each other. In the center the green strip
of marshy meadowland, with the water squirting from the galloping hoofs,
and the two crouching men, gleaming bright in the evening sun, on one
side the half circle of motionless horsemen, some in steel, some in
velvet, silent and attentive, dogs, hawks, and horses all turned to
stone; on the other the old peaked bridge, the blue lazy river, the
group of openmouthed rustics, and the dark old manor-house with one grim
face which peered from the upper window.
