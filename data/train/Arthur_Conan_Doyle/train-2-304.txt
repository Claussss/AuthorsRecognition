nothing, but I, who knew him so well, could read in his face some
emotion which I had never seen there before. At first I thought that it
was dislike. And then, gradually, I understood that it was more than
dislike. It was fear—a deep, secret, shrinking fear. That night—the

by his love for me and by all that he held dear to hold nothing from
me, and to tell me why this huge man overshadowed him so.
