“From that day to this,” it said, “I have had no night or day free from
the intrusion of that dreadful sound with its accompanying train of
thought. Time and custom have brought me no relief, but on the contrary,

nerves become less able to bear up against the continual strain. “I am a broken man in mind and body. I live in a state of tension,
always straining my ears for the hated sound, afraid to converse with
my fellows for fear of exposing my dreadful condition to them, with
no comfort or hope of comfort on this side of the grave. I should be
willing, Heaven knows, to die, and yet as each 5th of October comes
round, I am prostrated with fear because I do not know what strange and
terrible experience may be in store for me.
