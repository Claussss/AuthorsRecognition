Stevenson was deeply influenced by Meredith, and even in these books
the influence of the master is apparent. There is the apt use of an
occasional archaic or unusual word, the short, strong descriptions,
the striking metaphors, the somewhat staccato fashion of speech.
Yet, in spite of this flavour, they have quite individuality enough
to constitute a school of their own. Their faults, or rather perhaps
their limitations, lie never in the execution, but entirely in the
original conception. They picture only one side of life, and that a
strange and exceptional one. There is no female interest. We feel
that it is an apotheosis of the boy-story--the penny number of our
youth in excelsis. But it is all so good, so fresh, so picturesque,
that, however limited its scope, it still retains a definite and
well-assured place in literature. There is no reason why "Treasure
Island" should not be to the rising generation of the twenty-first
century what "Robinson Crusoe" has been to that of the nineteenth.
The balance of probability is all in that direction.
