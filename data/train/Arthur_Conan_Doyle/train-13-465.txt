      “And now I have to consider the motive of this singular crime. To
      get at this, I endeavoured first of all to solve the reason of
      the original burglary at Mr. Acton’s. I understood, from
      something which the Colonel told us, that a lawsuit had been
      going on between you, Mr. Acton, and the Cunninghams. Of course,
      it instantly occurred to me that they had broken into your
      library with the intention of getting at some document which
      might be of importance in the case.”
