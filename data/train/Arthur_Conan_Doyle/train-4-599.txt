‘Aye, aye, Doctor,’ said Monmouth impatiently. ‘Speak to the point, or
give place to another.’ ‘I shall mak’ mysel’ clear, your Majesty. Have we no heard that Argyle
is cutten off? And why was he cutten off? Because he hadna due faith
in the workings o’ the Almighty, and must needs reject the help o’ the
children o’ light in favour o’ the bare-legged spawn o’ Prelacy, wha are
half Pagan, half Popish. Had he walked in the path o’ the Lord he wudna
be lying in the Tolbooth o’ Edinburgh wi’ the tow or the axe before
him. Why did he no gird up his loins and march straight onwards wi’
the banner o’ light, instead o’ dallying here and biding there like a
half-hairted Didymus? And the same or waur will fa’ upon us if we dinna
march on intae the land and plant our ensigns afore the wicked toun o’
London--the toun where the Lord’s wark is tae be done, and the tares tae
be separated frae the wheat, and piled up for the burning.’
