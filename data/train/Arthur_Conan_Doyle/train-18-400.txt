I went into the cave, and how any man could live in it a week is a
mystery to me, for it was little more than four feet high, and as damp
and dismal a grotto as ever was seen. A wooden settle and a rough
table were the sole furniture, with a lot of parchment scrolls with
hieroglyphics. Well, he has gone where he will learn that the gospel of peace and good
will is superior to all his Pagan lore. Peace go with him.
