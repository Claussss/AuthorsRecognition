Now, Nigel, young and inexperienced, all Nature's aid will not help you
against the mixed craft and strength of such a warrior. The day will
come when neither Manny nor even Chandos could sweep you from your
saddle; but now, even had you some less cumbrous armor, your chance were
small. Your downfall is near; but as you see the famous black chevrons
on a golden ground your gallant heart which never knew fear is only
filled with joy and amazement at the honor done you. Your downfall is
near, and yet in your wildest dreams you would never guess how strange
your downfall is to be.
