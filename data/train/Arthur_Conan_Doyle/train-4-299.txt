‘Gott in Himmel!’ cried Saxon, ‘it is ever thus! A gibbet draws witches
as a magnet draws needles. All the hexerei of the country side will sit
round one, like cats round a milk-pail. Beware of her! she hath the evil
eye!’ ‘Poor soul! It is the evil stomach that she hath,’ said Reuben, walking
his horse up to her. ‘Whoever saw such a bag of bones! I warrant that
she is pining away for want of a crust of bread.’
