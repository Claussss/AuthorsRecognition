The truth of what is told us as to the life beyond can in its very
nature never be absolutely established.  It is far nearer to complete
proof, however, than any religious revelation which has ever preceded
it.  We have the fact that these accounts are mixed up with others
concerning our present life which are often absolutely true.  If a
spirit can tell the truth about our sphere, it is difficult to suppose
that he is entirely false about his own.  Then, again, there is a very
great similarity about such accounts, though their origin may be from
people very far apart.  Thus though "non-veridical," to use the modern
jargon, they do conform to all our canons of evidence.  A series of
books which have attracted far less attention than they deserve have
drawn the coming life in very close detail.  These books are not found
on railway bookstalls or in popular libraries, but the successive
editions through which they pass show that there is a deeper public
which gets what it wants in spite of artificial obstacles.
