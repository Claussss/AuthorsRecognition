      “A rude fellow,” said our guide, flushing with anger as we
      withdrew down the stair. “Of course, he did not realize that it
      was I who was knocking, but none the less his conduct was very
      uncourteous, and, indeed, under the circumstances rather
      suspicious.”       Holmes’s response was a curious one.       “Can you tell me his exact height?” he asked.       “Really, Mr. Holmes, I cannot undertake to say. He is taller than
      the Indian, not so tall as Gilchrist. I suppose five foot six
      would be about it.”
