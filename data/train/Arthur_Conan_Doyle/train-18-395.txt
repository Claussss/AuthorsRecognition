In the side of the cliff, close to the pile of stones where the Hillmen
were making their last stand, there was a cave which looked more like
the lair of some wild beast than a human habitation. Out of this dark archway there suddenly emerged an old man--such a
very, very old man that all the other veterans whom I have seen were
as chickens compared with him. His hair and beard were both as white
as snow, and each reached more than half-way to his waist. His face was
wrinkled and brown and ebony, a cross between a monkey and a mummy, and
so thin and emaciated were his shrivelled limbs that you would hardly
have given him credit for having any vitality left, were it not for his
eyes, which glittered and sparkled with excitement, like two diamonds in
a setting of mahogany.
