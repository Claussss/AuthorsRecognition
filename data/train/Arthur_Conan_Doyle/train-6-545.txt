Such was the vague whirling memory still lingering in Nigel's mind when
at last the mists cleared away from it and he found himself weak but
clear on the low couch in the corner turret. Beside him, crushing
lavender betwixt his rough fingers and strewing it over floor and
sheets, was Aylward the archer. His longbow leaned at the foot of the
bed, and his steel cap was balanced on the top of it, while he himself,
sitting in his shirt sleeves, fanned off the flies and scattered the
fragrant herbs over his helpless master.
