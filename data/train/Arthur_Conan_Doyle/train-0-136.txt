“Yes,” said Holmes; “by John Underwood and Sons, 129, Camberwell Road.” Gregson looked quite crest-fallen. “I had no idea that you noticed that,” he said. “Have you been there?” “Ha!” cried Gregson, in a relieved voice; “you should never neglect a
chance, however small it may seem.” “To a great mind, nothing is little,” remarked Holmes, sententiously. “Well, I went to Underwood, and asked him if he had sold a hat of that
size and description. He looked over his books, and came on it at once.
He had sent the hat to a Mr. Drebber, residing at Charpentier’s Boarding
Establishment, Torquay Terrace. Thus I got at his address.”
