‘See the mon wi’ a face like a gerfalcon,’ cried one, pointing to Saxon;
‘’tis he that slew the Philistine officer yestreen, an’ brought the
faithful off victorious.’ ‘Mark ye yon other one,’ cried an old dame, ‘him wi’ the white face an’
the clothes like a prince. He’s one o’ the Quality, what’s come a’ the
way froe Lunnon to testify to the Protestant creed. He’s a main pious
gentleman, he is, an’ if he had bided in the wicked city they’d ha’ had
his head off, like they did the good Lord Roossell, or put him in chains
wi’ the worthy Maister Baxter.’
