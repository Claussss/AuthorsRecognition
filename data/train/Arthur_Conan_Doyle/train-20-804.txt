      Before evening, we had a visit from Inspector Stanley Hopkins.
      Things were not going very well with him.       “I believe that you are a wizard, Mr. Holmes. I really do
      sometimes think that you have powers that are not human. Now, how
      on earth could you know that the stolen silver was at the bottom
      of that pond?”       “I didn’t know it.”       “But you told me to examine it.”
