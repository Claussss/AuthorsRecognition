‘So,’ said he, pressing his seal above the fastening of the string, ‘I
see that your horse is ready for you outside. You had best make your way
round by Nether Stowey and the Bristol Channel, for we have heard that
the enemy’s horse guard the roads on the far side of Wells. Here is your
packet.’ I bowed and placed it in the inside of my tunic. ‘It is a written order as suggested in the council. The Duke’s reply may
be written, or it may be by word of mouth. In either case guard it well.
This packet contains also a copy of the depositions of the clergyman at
The Hague, and of the other witnesses who saw Charles of England marry
Lucy Walters, the mother of his Majesty. Your mission is one of such
importance that the whole success of our enterprise may turn upon it.
See that you serve the paper upon Beaufort in person, and not through
any intermediary, or it might not stand in a court of law.’
