“One instant, I pray you, my fair and most sweet lord,” cried the
Prince. “Assuage your wrath yet a little while, for this man's rede
deserves perhaps more thought than we have given it. He has turned your
noble soul sick with his talk of ransoms; but look at it, I pray
you, from the side of honor, and where could we find such hope of
worshipfully winning worship? I pray you to let me put my body in
this adventure, for it is one from which, if rightly handled, much
advancement is to be gained.”
