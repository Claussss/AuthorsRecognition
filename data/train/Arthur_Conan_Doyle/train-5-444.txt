"And so do I," whispered Smith. Lee looked up with a quick glance of surprise.  "You've learned, then!"
he said.  "You remember the advice I gave you?" "Yes, and I begin to think that I shall take it." "I don't know what the deuce you fellows are talking about," said
Hastie, "but I think, if I were you, Harrington, I should get Lee to
bed at once.  It will be time enough to discuss the why and the
wherefore when he is a little stronger.  I think, Smith, you and I can
leave him alone now.  I am walking back to college; if you are coming
in that direction, we can have a chat."
