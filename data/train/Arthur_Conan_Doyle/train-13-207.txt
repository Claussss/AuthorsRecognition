      It was a very dark night, and a thin rain began to fall as we
      turned from the high road into a narrow lane, deeply rutted, with
      hedges on either side. Mr. Grant Munro pushed impatiently
      forward, however, and we stumbled after him as best we could.       “There are the lights of my house,” he murmured, pointing to a
      glimmer among the trees. “And here is the cottage which I am
      going to enter.”
