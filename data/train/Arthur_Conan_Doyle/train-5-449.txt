"You're a raving lunatic," said Bellingham. "All right.  You just remember what I say, for you'll find that I'll be
better than my word." The door slammed, and Smith went fuming up to his chamber, where he
locked the door upon the inside, and spent half the night in smoking
his old briar and brooding over the strange events of the evening. Next morning Abercrombie Smith heard nothing of his neighbour, but
Harrington called upon him in the afternoon to say that Lee was almost
himself again.  All day Smith stuck fast to his work, but in the
evening he determined to pay the visit to his friend Dr. Peterson upon
which he had started upon the night before.  A good walk and a friendly
chat would be welcome to his jangled nerves.
