Chapter XI. Of the Lonely Man and the Gold Chest The strong yellow glare which had attracted us across the moor found its
way out through a single narrow slit alongside the door which served the
purpose of a rude window. As we advanced towards it the light changed
suddenly to red, and that again to green, throwing a ghastly pallor over
our faces, and especially heightening the cadaverous effect of Saxon’s
austere features. At the same time we became aware of a most subtle
and noxious odour which poisoned the air all round the cottage.
This combination of portents in so lonely a spot worked upon the old
man-at-arms’ superstitious feelings to such an extent that he paused
and looked back at us inquiringly. Both Reuben and I were determined,
however, to carry the adventure through, so he contented himself with
falling a little behind us, and pattering to himself some exorcism
appropriate to the occasion. Walking up to the door, I rapped upon it
with the hilt of my sword and announced that we were weary travellers
who were seeking a night’s shelter.
