The road from Dinan to Caulnes, along which the small army was moving,
rose and dipped over undulating ground, with a bare marshy plain upon
the left where the river Rance ran down to the sea, while upon the right
lay a wooded country with a few wretched villages, so poor and sordid
that they had nothing with which to tempt the spoiler. The peasants had
left them at the first twinkle of a steel cap, and lurked at the edges
of the woods, ready in an instant to dive into those secret recesses
known only to themselves. These creatures suffered sorely at the hands
of both parties, but when the chance came they revenged their wrongs on
either in a savage way which brought fresh brutalities upon their heads.
