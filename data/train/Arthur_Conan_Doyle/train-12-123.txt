“But, good heavens, sir!” stammered Rupert Garraweg, “have you
not heard? Have you not seen? We cannot allow you to do this thing
blindfold; can we Louis?” “Most certainly not. We cannot recommend our bank, sir, at the present
moment, for there is a run upon us, and we do not know to what lengths
it may go.” “Tut! tut!” said Raffles Haw. “If the run continues you must send me a
wire, and I shall make a small addition to my account. You will send me
a receipt by post. Good-morning, gentlemen!” He bowed himself out ere
the astounded partners could realise what had befallen them, or raise
their eyes from the huge black bag and the visiting card which lay upon
their table. There was no great failure in Birmingham that day, and the
house of Garraweg still survives to enjoy the success which it deserves.
