Marshal of the army, sprang to his feet, his face red with anger. “Eustace; Eustace,” said he, “I bear in mind the days when you were of
great heart and high enterprise, but since King Edward gave you yonder
chaplet of pearls you have ever been backward against the English!” “My Lord Clermont,” said de Ribeaumont sternly, “it is not for me to
brawl at the King's council and in the face of the enemy, but we will
go further into this matter at some other time. Meanwhile, the King has
asked me for my advice and I have given it as best I might.”
