       _P.S.--I thoroughly believe in Spirit-ualism._" Here is another.      "HONORED SIR,--_Just a few lines in limited time to ask you if you
     tell the future. If so, what is your charges? Please excuse no
     stamped and ad. envelope--out of stamps and in haste to catch mail.
     Please excuse._" On the other hand, I had many which were splendidly instructive and
helpful. I was particularly struck by one series of spirit messages
which were received in automatic writing by a man living in the Bush in
North Queensland and thrown upon his own resources. They were
descriptive of life in the beyond, and were in parts extremely
corroborative of the Vale Owen messages, though they had been taken long
prior to that date. Some of the points of resemblance were so marked and
so unusual that they seem clearly to come from a common inspiration. As
an example, this script spoke of the creative power of thought in the
beyond, but added the detail that when the object to be created was
large and important a band of thinkers was required, just as a band of
workers would be here. This exactly corresponds to the teaching of Vale
Owen's guide.
