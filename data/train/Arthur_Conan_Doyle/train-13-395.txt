      “And now how was I to proceed to reconstruct this midnight drama?
      Clearly, only one could fit into the hole, and that one was
      Brunton. The girl must have waited above. Brunton then unlocked
      the box, handed up the contents presumably—since they were not to
      be found—and then—and then what happened?       “What smouldering fire of vengeance had suddenly sprung into
      flame in this passionate Celtic woman’s soul when she saw the man
      who had wronged her—wronged her, perhaps, far more than we
      suspected—in her power? Was it a chance that the wood had
      slipped, and that the stone had shut Brunton into what had become
      his sepulchre? Had she only been guilty of silence as to his
      fate? Or had some sudden blow from her hand dashed the support
      away and sent the slab crashing down into its place? Be that as
      it might, I seemed to see that woman’s figure still clutching at
      her treasure trove and flying wildly up the winding stair, with
      her ears ringing perhaps with the muffled screams from behind her
      and with the drumming of frenzied hands against the slab of stone
      which was choking her faithless lover’s life out.
