With another woman he might have urged the point, but his instincts
told him that it was quite useless with this one.  Her tone of voice
was conclusive.  He said nothing, but leaned back in his chair a
stricken man. "I am so sorry," she said again.  "If I had known what was passing in
your mind I should have told you earlier that I intended to devote my
life entirely to science.  There are many women with a capacity for
marriage, but few with a taste for biology.  I will remain true to my
own line, then.  I came down here while waiting for an opening in the
Paris Physiological Laboratory.  I have just heard that there is a
vacancy for me there, and so you will be troubled no more by my
intrusion upon your practice.  I have done you an injustice just as you
did me one.  I thought you narrow and pedantic, with no good quality.
I have learned during your illness to appreciate you better, and the
recollection of our friendship will always be a very pleasant one to
me."
