through his trouser-leg half-way down the shin. "Compound!" he groaned. "A three months' job," and fainted. When he came to himself the groom was gone, for he had scudded off to

front of his injured leg, and a woman, with an open case of polished
instruments gleaming in the yellow light, was deftly slitting up his
trouser with a crooked pair of scissors.
