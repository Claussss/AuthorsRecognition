“Nay, nay, sire, too much honor hath already been done him!” said Manny,
looking angrily at the motionless horseman. “That this untried boy
should be able to say that in one evening he has unhorsed my Squire, and
seen the back of one of the bravest knights in England is surely enough
to turn his foolish head. Fetch me a spear, Robert! I will see what I
can make of him.” The famous knight took the spear when it was brought to him as a
master-workman takes a tool. He balanced it, shook it once or twice in
the air, ran his eyes down it for a flaw in the wood, and then finally
having made sure of its poise and weight laid it carefully in rest under
his arm. Then gathering up his bridle so as to have his horse under
perfect command, and covering himself with the shield, which was slung
round his neck, he rode out to do battle.
