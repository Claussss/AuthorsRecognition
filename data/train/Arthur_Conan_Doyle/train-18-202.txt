This was the last and only communication which I ever received from the
tenant of Cloomber. I have been asked frequently by neighbours and others who were
interested in the matter whether he gave me the impression of insanity.
To this I must unhesitatingly answer in the negative. On the contrary,
his remarks gave me the idea of a man who had both read and thought
deeply. I observed, however, during our single interview, that his reflexes
were feeble, his arcus senilis well marked, and his arteries
atheromatous--all signs that his constitution was in an unsatisfactory
condition, and that a sudden crisis might be apprehended.
