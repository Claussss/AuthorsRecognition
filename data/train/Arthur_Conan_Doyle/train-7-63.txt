“What's this?” he was asking in his wheezy voice, pointing up with a
yellow Assouan cane. “That is a hippopotamus,” said the dragoman; and the tourists all
tittered, for there was just a suspicion of Mr. Stuart himself in the
carving. “But it isn't bigger than a little pig,” he protested. “You see that the
King is putting his spear through it with ease.” “They make it small to show that it was a very small thing to the King,”
 said the dragoman. “So you see that all the King's prisoners do not
exceed his knee--which is not because he was so much taller, but so much
more powerful. You see that he is bigger than his horse, because he is a
king and the other is only a horse. The same way, these small women whom
you see here and there are just his trivial little wives.”
