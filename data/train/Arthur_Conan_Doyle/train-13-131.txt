      “When I came to examine the address of the packet I observed that
      it was to Miss S. Cushing. Now, the oldest sister would, of
      course, be Miss Cushing, and although her initial was ‘S’ it
      might belong to one of the others as well. In that case we should
      have to commence our investigation from a fresh basis altogether.
      I therefore went into the house with the intention of clearing up
      this point. I was about to assure Miss Cushing that I was
      convinced that a mistake had been made when you may remember that
      I came suddenly to a stop. The fact was that I had just seen
      something which filled me with surprise and at the same time
      narrowed the field of our inquiry immensely.
