CHAPTER IV. OF A YOUNG MAN WITH A GREY HEAD If I had any personal soreness on account of this family snub, it was a
very passing emotion, and one which was soon effaced from my mind. It chanced that on the very next day after the episode I had occasion
to pass that way, and stopped to have another look at the obnoxious
placard. I was standing staring at it and wondering what could have
induced our neighbours to take such an outrageous step, when I became
suddenly aware of a sweet, girlish face which peeped out at me from
between the bars of the gate, and of a white hand which eagerly beckoned
me to approach. As I advanced to her I saw that it was the same young
lady whom I had seen in the carriage.
