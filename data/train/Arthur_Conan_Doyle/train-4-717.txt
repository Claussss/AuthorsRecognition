As I knew that the Dukeâ€™s seat was miles on the Gloucestershire side of
the city, and as I feared lest I might be arrested and examined should I
attempt to pass the gates, I struck inland with intent to ride round the
walls and so avoid the peril. The path which I followed led me into a
country lane, which in turn opened into a broad highway crowded with
travellers, both on horseback and on foot. As the troublous times
required that a man should journey with his arms, there was naught in
my outfit to excite remark, and I was able to jog on among the other
horsemen without question or suspicion. From their appearance they were,
I judged, country farmers or squires for the most part, who were riding
into Bristol to hear the news, and to store away their things of price
in a place of safety.
