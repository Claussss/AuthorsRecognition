I was by no means inclined to let them off cheaply now that I had them
in my power. On the contrary, I determined to teach them such a lesson
that the sight of a single scarlet uniform would in future be a passport
in itself. We followed hard upon the track of the fugitives and entered the Terada
defile at their very heels. Having detached Chamberlain and Elliott with
a company on either side to protect my wings, I pushed on with my Sepoys
and a handful of artillerymen, giving the enemy no time to rally or
to recover themselves. We were so handicapped, however, by our stiff
European uniforms and by our want of practice in climbing, that we
should have been unable to overtake any of the mountaineers had it not
been for a fortunate accident.
