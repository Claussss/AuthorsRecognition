      Together we stole down to the road and crept across to the door
      of the inn. The bicycle still leaned against the wall. Holmes
      struck a match and held it to the back wheel, and I heard him
      chuckle as the light fell upon a patched Dunlop tire. Up above us
      was the lighted window.       “I must have a peep through that, Watson. If you bend your back
      and support yourself upon the wall, I think that I can manage.”
