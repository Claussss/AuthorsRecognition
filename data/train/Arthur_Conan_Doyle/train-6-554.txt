“Ha, my little cock of Tilford Bridge, I still bear you in mind,” said
he. “Right glad I was to hear that you had found your wits again, and I
trust that I have not helped to make you take leave of them once more.” Nigel's stare of astonishment had brought a smile to the King's lips.
Now the Squire stammered forth some halting words of gratitude at the
honor done to him. “Nay, not a word,” said the King. “But in sooth it is a joy to my
heart to see the son of my old comrade Eustace Loring carry himself so
bravely. Had this boat got before us with news of our coming, then all
our labor had been in vain, and no Frenchman ventured to Calais that
night. But above all I thank you for that you have delivered into my
hands one whom I had vowed to punish in that he has caused us more
scathe by fouler means than any living man. Twice have I sworn that
Peter the Red Ferret shall hang, for all his noble blood and coat-armor,
if ever he should fall into my hands. Now at last his time has come;
but I would not put him to death until you, who had taken him, could be
there to see it done. Nay, thank me not, for I could do no less, seeing
that it is to you that I owe him.”
