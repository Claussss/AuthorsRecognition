Taking only that one book, "The Jesuits in Canada," it is worth a
reputation in itself. And how noble a tribute is this which a man
of Puritan blood pays to that wonderful Order! He shows how in the
heyday of their enthusiasm these brave soldiers of the Cross invaded
Canada as they did China and every other place where danger was to
be faced, and a horrible death to be found. I don't care what faith
a man may profess, or whether he be a Christian at all, but he
cannot read these true records without feeling that the very highest
that man has ever evolved in sanctity and devotion was to be found
among these marvellous men. They were indeed the pioneers of
civilization, for apart from doctrines they brought among the
savages the highest European culture, and in their own deportment an
object-lesson of how chastely, austerely, and nobly men could live.
France has sent myriads of brave men on to her battlefields, but in
all her long record of glory I do not think that she can point to
any courage so steadfast and so absolutely heroic as that of the
men of the Iroquois Mission.
