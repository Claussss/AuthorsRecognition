There was no illumination of the windows tonight. From roof to basement
not a light twinkled in any part of the great building. Its huge mass
loomed up dark and sullen amid the trees which surrounded it, looking
more like some giant sarcophagus than a human habitation. To our overwrought nerves there was something of terror in its mere bulk
and its silence. We stood for some little time peering at it through the
darkness, and then we made our way back to the parlour again, where
we sat waiting--waiting, we knew not for what, and yet with absolute
conviction that some terrible experience was in store for us.
