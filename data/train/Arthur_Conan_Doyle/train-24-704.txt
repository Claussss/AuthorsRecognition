“Sir knight,” said the prince, “you speak like a brave man, and our
cousin of France is happy in having a cavalier who is so fit to uphold
his cause either with tongue or with sword. But if you think such evil
of us, how comes it that you have trusted yourselves to us without
warranty or safe-conduct?” “Because I knew that you would be here, sire. Had the man who sits upon
your right been ruler of this land, I had indeed thought twice before I
looked to him for aught that was knightly or generous.” With a soldierly
salute, he wheeled round his horse, and, galloping down the lists,
disappeared amid the dense crowd of footmen and of horsemen who were
streaming away from the scene of the tournament.
