“There is nothing at all, sir.” “Your people were in their usual spirits?” “Never better.” “Were they nervous people? Did they ever show any apprehension of
coming danger?” “Nothing of the kind.” “You have nothing to add then, which could assist me?” Mortimer Tregennis considered earnestly for a moment. “There is one thing that occurs to me,” said he at last. “As we sat at
the table my back was to the window, and my brother George, he being my
partner at cards, was facing it. I saw him once look hard over my
shoulder, so I turned round and looked also. The blind was up and the
window shut, but I could just make out the bushes on the lawn, and it
seemed to me for a moment that I saw something moving among them. I
couldn’t even say if it was man or animal, but I just thought there was
something there. When I asked him what he was looking at, he told me
that he had the same feeling. That is all that I can say.”
