"Put him out!"  "Shove him off the platform!"  "Fair play!" emerged

his feet flapping both his hands and bleating excitedly.  "Professor

clouds of inaudible mutter.  The interrupter bowed, smiled, stroked his
beard, and relapsed into his chair.  Waldron, very flushed and warlike,
continued his observations.  Now and then, as he made an assertion, he
shot a venomous glance at his opponent, who seemed to be slumbering
deeply, with the same broad, happy smile upon his face.
