handfuls before the lodger came to the window. You beckoned him to come
down. He dressed hurriedly and descended to his sitting-room. You
entered by the window. There was an interview—a short one—during which
you walked up and down the room. Then you passed out and closed the
window, standing on the lawn outside smoking a cigar and watching what
occurred. Finally, after the death of Tregennis, you withdrew as you
had come. Now, Dr. Sterndale, how do you justify such conduct, and what
were the motives for your actions? If you prevaricate or trifle with
me, I give you my assurance that the matter will pass out of my hands
forever.”
