Yet it has its place in my main line of thought, for it leads me
straight to the very next upon the shelf, Bullen's "Cruise of the
Cachelot," a book which is full of the glamour and the mystery of
the sea, marred only by the brutality of those who go down to it
in ships. This is the sperm-whale fishing, an open-sea affair, and
very different from that Greenland ice groping in which I served
a seven-months' apprenticeship. Both, I fear, are things of the
past--certainly the northern fishing is so, for why should men
risk their lives to get oil when one has but to sink a pipe in the
ground. It is the more fortunate then that it should have been
handled by one of the most virile writers who has described a
sailor's life. Bullen's English at its best rises to a great height.
If I wished to show how high, I would take that next book down,
"Sea Idylls."
