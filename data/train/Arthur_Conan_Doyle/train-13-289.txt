      â€œOne evening, shortly after my arrival, we were sitting over a
      glass of port after dinner, when young Trevor began to talk about
      those habits of observation and inference which I had already
      formed into a system, although I had not yet appreciated the part
      which they were to play in my life. The old man evidently thought
      that his son was exaggerating in his description of one or two
      trivial feats which I had performed.
