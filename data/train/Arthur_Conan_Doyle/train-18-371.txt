Now, this morning two urgent messages were sent me from two different
points more than sixteen miles apart, to say that there were signs of a
descent of the tribes. Elliott, with one gun and the Sowars, went to the farther ravine, while
I, with the infantry, hurried to the other, but we found it was a false
alarm. I saw no signs of the Hillmen, and though we were greeted by a
splutter of jezail bullets we were unable to capture any of the rascals.
