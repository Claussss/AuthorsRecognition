There is some consolation in the thought, then, that those odious
impulses for which I have blamed myself do not really come from me at
all.  They are all transferred from her, little as I could have guessed
it at the time.  I feel cleaner and lighter for the thought. April 8.  Yes, now, in broad daylight, writing coolly and with time for
reflection, I am compelled to confirm every thing which I wrote in my
journal last night.  I am in a horrible position, but, above all, I
must not lose my head.  I must pit my intellect against her powers.
After all, I am no silly puppet, to dance at the end of a string.  I
have energy, brains, courage.  For all her devil's tricks I may beat
her yet.  May!  I MUST, or what is to become of me?
