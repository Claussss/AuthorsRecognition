They were now but a short distance from their destination; but they had
hardly started on their journey through the forest next morning, when an
adventure befell them which filled Nigel with the wildest hopes. Along the narrow winding path between the great oak trees there rode
a dark sallow man in a scarlet tabard who blew so loudly upon a silver
trumpet that they heard the clanging call long before they set eyes on
him. Slowly he advanced, pulling up every fifty paces to make the forest
ring with another warlike blast. The comrades rode forward to meet him.
