‘My eye is still true and my hand firm, though both are perhaps a trifle
the worse for want of use,’ said Saxon, only too glad at the chance
of drawing the eyes of the chiefs upon him. ‘At backsword, sword and
dagger, sword and buckler, single falchion and case of falchions, mine
old challenge still holds good against any comer, save only my brother
Quartus, who plays as well as I do, but hath an extra half-inch in reach
which gives him the vantage.’
