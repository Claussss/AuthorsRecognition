“Thank God!” said Alleyne suddenly, as he spied in the lamp-light a
shock of blazing red hair which fringed a steel cap high above the heads
of the crowd. “Here is John, and Aylward, too! Help us, comrades, for
there is wrong being done to this maid and to the old man.” “Hola, mon petit,” said the old bowman, pushing his way through the
crowd, with the huge forester at his heels. “What is all this, then?
By the twang of string! I think that you will have some work upon your
hands if you are to right all the wrongs that you may see upon this side
of the water. It is not to be thought that a troop of bowmen, with the
wine buzzing in their ears, will be as soft-spoken as so many young
clerks in an orchard. When you have been a year with the Company
you will think less of such matters. But what is amiss here? The
provost-marshal with his archers is coming this way, and some of you may
find yourselves in the stretch-neck, if you take not heed.”
