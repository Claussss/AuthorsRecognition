      In a quarter of an hour or so we were back at the physician’s
      house. He came running out to meet us with a face of horror.       “Oh, such a business!” he cried, with his hands to his temples.       “What then?”       “Blessington has committed suicide!”       Holmes whistled.       “Yes, he hanged himself during the night.”       We had entered, and the doctor had preceded us into what was
      evidently his waiting-room.
