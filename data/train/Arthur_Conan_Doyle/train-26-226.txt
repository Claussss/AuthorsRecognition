The mere suspicion of scientific thought or scientific methods has
a great charm in any branch of literature, however far it may be
removed from actual research. Poe's tales, for example, owe much to
this effect, though in his case it was a pure illusion. Jules Verne
also produces a charmingly credible effect for the most incredible
things by an adept use of a considerable amount of real knowledge
of nature. But most gracefully of all does it shine in the lighter
form of essay, where playful thoughts draw their analogies and
illustrations from actual fact, each showing up the other, and the
combination presenting a peculiar piquancy to the reader.
