"I think I should back my little friend," said Lord John, caressing his
Express.  "But the beast would certainly have a good sporting chance." Summerlee raised his hand. "Hush!" he cried.  "Surely I hear something?" From the utter silence there emerged a deep, regular pat-pat.  It was
the tread of some animal--the rhythm of soft but heavy pads placed
cautiously upon the ground.  It stole slowly round the camp, and then
halted near our gateway.  There was a low, sibilant rise and fall--the
breathing of the creature.  Only our feeble hedge separated us from
this horror of the night.  Each of us had seized his rifle, and Lord
John had pulled out a small bush to make an embrasure in the hedge.
