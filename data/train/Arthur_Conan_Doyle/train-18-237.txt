It seemed, however, that our efforts were fated to be in vain. As we mounted upon a surge I saw a giant wave, topping all the others,
and coming after them like a driver following a flock, sweep down upon
the vessel, curling its great, green arch over the breaking deck. With a rending, riving sound the ship split in two where the terrible,
serrated back of the Hansel reef was sawing into her keel. The
after-part, with the broken mizzen and the three Orientals, sank
backwards into deep water and vanished, while the fore-half oscillated
helplessly about, retaining its precarious balance upon the rocks.
