      “Mr. Blessington seemed more excited over the matter than I
      should have thought possible, though of course it was enough to
      disturb anybody’s peace of mind. He actually sat crying in an
      armchair, and I could hardly get him to speak coherently. It was
      his suggestion that I should come round to you, and of course I
      at once saw the propriety of it, for certainly the incident is a
      very singular one, though he appears to completely overrate its
      importance. If you would only come back with me in my brougham,
      you would at least be able to soothe him, though I can hardly
      hope that you will be able to explain this remarkable
      occurrence.”
