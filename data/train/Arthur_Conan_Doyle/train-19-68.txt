April 9.  Victory!  I have done splendidly!  At seven o'clock last
night I took a hasty dinner, and then locked myself up in my bedroom
and dropped the key into the garden.  I chose a cheery novel, and lay
in bed for three hours trying to read it, but really in a horrible
state of trepidation, expecting every instant that I should become
conscious of the impulse.  Nothing of the sort occurred, however, and I
awoke this morning with the feeling that a black nightmare had been
lifted off me.  Perhaps the creature realized what I had done, and
understood that it was useless to try to influence me.  At any rate, I
have beaten her once, and if I can do it once, I can do it again.
