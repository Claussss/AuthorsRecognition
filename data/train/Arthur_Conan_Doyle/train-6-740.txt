your betrothed?” “She is my love,” answered the Frenchman. “We are but waiting for the
Count to be slain in the wars, and then we mean to marry. And this lady
of thine, Nigel? I would that I could see her.” “Perchance you shall, fair sir,” said Nigel, “for all that I have seen
of you fills me with desire to go further with you. It is in my mind
that we might turn this thing to profit and to honor, for when Sir
Robert has spoken with you, I am free to do with you as I will.”
