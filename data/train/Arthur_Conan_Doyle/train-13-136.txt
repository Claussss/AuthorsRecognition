      “I was curious, in the first place, to see how far the family ear
      had been reproduced in her. Then, of course, she might give us
      very important information, but I was not sanguine that she
      would. She must have heard of the business the day before, since
      all Croydon was ringing with it, and she alone could have
      understood for whom the packet was meant. If she had been willing
      to help justice she would probably have communicated with the
      police already. However, it was clearly our duty to see her, so
      we went. We found that the news of the arrival of the packet—for
      her illness dated from that time—had such an effect upon her as
      to bring on brain fever. It was clearer than ever that she
      understood its full significance, but equally clear that we
      should have to wait some time for any assistance from her.
