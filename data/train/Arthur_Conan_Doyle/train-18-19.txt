“It hasna a guid name after dark, yon hoose,” remarked my companion,
slackening his pace perceptibly as I explained to him the nature of our
errand. “It's no for naething that him wha owns it wunna gang within a
Scotch mile o't.” “Well, Seth, there is some one who has no fears about going into it,”
 said I, pointing to the great, white building which flickered up in
front of us through the gloom. The light which I had observed from the sea was moving backwards and
forward past the lower floor windows, the shutters of which had been
removed. I could now see that a second fainter light followed a few
paces behind the other. Evidently two individuals, the one with a
lamp and the other with a candle or rushlight, were making a careful
examination of the building.
