      A minute later we were in the street and walking for home. We had
      crossed Oxford Street and were half way down Harley Street before
      I could get a word from my companion.       “Sorry to bring you out on such a fool’s errand, Watson,” he said
      at last. “It is an interesting case, too, at the bottom of it.”       “I can make little of it,” I confessed.       “Well, it is quite evident that there are two men—more, perhaps,
      but at least two—who are determined for some reason to get at
      this fellow Blessington. I have no doubt in my mind that both on
      the first and on the second occasion that young man penetrated to
      Blessington’s room, while his confederate, by an ingenious
      device, kept the doctor from interfering.”
