      “‘It’s the bell of the room you were working in.’       “A cold hand seemed to close round my heart. Some one, then, was
      in that room where my precious treaty lay upon the table. I ran
      frantically up the stairs and along the passage. There was no one
      in the corridors, Mr. Holmes. There was no one in the room. All
      was exactly as I left it, save only that the papers which had
      been committed to my care had been taken from the desk on which
      they lay. The copy was there, and the original was gone.”
