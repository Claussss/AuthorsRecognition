      â€œFrom this starting-point I proceeded to step, having first taken
      the cardinal points by my pocket-compass. Ten steps with each
      foot took me along parallel with the wall of the house, and again
      I marked my spot with a peg. Then I carefully paced off five to
      the east and two to the south. It brought me to the very
      threshold of the old door. Two steps to the west meant now that I
      was to go two paces down the stone-flagged passage, and this was
      the place indicated by the Ritual.
