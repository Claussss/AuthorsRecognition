But there was one more visit to be paid and one more farewell to be
spoken ere Nigel could leave the moorlands where he had dwelled so long.
That evening he donned his brightest tunic, dark purple velvet of Genoa,
with trimming of miniver, his hat with the snow-white feather curling
round the front, and his belt of embossed silver round his loins.
Mounted on lordly Pommers, with his hawk upon wrist and his sword by
his side, never did fairer young gallant or one more modest in mind set
forth upon such an errand. It was but the old Knight of Duplin to whom
he would say farewell; but the Knight of Duplin had two daughters, Edith
and Mary, and Edith was the fairest maid in all the heather-country.
