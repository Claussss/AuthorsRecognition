Justice compelled me to acknowledge in my own heart that the murderous
spirit had been set on foot by the Christian before it was taken up by
the Buddhists, but I forbore to remark upon it, for fear of irritating
my companion. For a long time I could not draw him away from the scene of his father's
death, but at last, by repeated arguments and reasonings, I succeeded in
making him realise how useless and unprofitable any further efforts on
our part must necessarily prove, and in inducing him to return with me
to Cloomber.
