      “And now I made a very careful examination of the corner of paper
      which the Inspector had submitted to us. It was at once clear to
      me that it formed part of a very remarkable document. Here it is.
      Do you not now observe something very suggestive about it?”       “It has a very irregular look,” said the Colonel.       “My dear sir,” cried Holmes, “there cannot be the least doubt in
      the world that it has been written by two persons doing alternate
      words. When I draw your attention to the strong t’s of ‘at’ and
      ‘to’, and ask you to compare them with the weak ones of ‘quarter’
      and ‘twelve,’ you will instantly recognise the fact. A very brief
      analysis of these four words would enable you to say with the
      utmost confidence that the ‘learn’ and the ‘maybe’ are written in
      the stronger hand, and the ‘what’ in the weaker.”
