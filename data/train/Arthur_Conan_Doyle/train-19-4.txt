10.50 P. M.  This diary-keeping of mine is, I fancy, the outcome of
that scientific habit of mind about which I wrote this morning.  I like
to register impressions while they are fresh.  Once a day at least I
endeavor to define my own mental position.  It is a useful piece of
self-analysis, and has, I fancy, a steadying effect upon the character.
Frankly, I must confess that my own needs what stiffening I can give
it.  I fear that, after all, much of my neurotic temperament survives,
and that I am far from that cool, calm precision which characterizes
Murdoch or Pratt-Haldane.  Otherwise, why should the tomfoolery which I
have witnessed this evening have set my nerves thrilling so that even
now I am all unstrung?  My only comfort is that neither Wilson nor Miss
Penclosa nor even Agatha could have possibly known my weakness.
