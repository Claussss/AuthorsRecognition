This is not an over-coloured picture.  Can we not see, then, what was
the inner reason for the war?  Can we not understand that it was
needful to shake mankind loose from gossip and pink teas, and
sword-worship, and Saturday night drunks, and self-seeking politics and
theological quibbles--to wake them up and make them realise that they
stand upon a narrow knife-edge between two awful eternities, and that,
here and now, they have to finish with make-beliefs, and with real
earnestness and courage face those truths which have always been
palpable where indolence, or cowardice, or vested interests have not
obscured the vision.  Let us try to appreciate what those truths are
and the direction which reform must take.  It is the new spiritual
developments which predominate in my own thoughts, but there are two
other great readjustments which are necessary before they can take
their full effect.  On the spiritual side I can speak with the force of
knowledge from the beyond.  On the other two points of reform, I make
no such claim.
