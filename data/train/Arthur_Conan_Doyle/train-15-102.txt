"If it please you, great CÃ¦sar," said Arsenius Platus, the officer of
attendance, "the man cannot be found, and there are some very strange
rumours flying about." "Rumours!" cried the angry Nero. "What do you mean, Arsenius? I tell you
that the fellow was an ignorant upstart with the bearing of a boor and
the voice of a peacock. I tell you also that there are a good many who
are as guilty as he among the people, for I heard them with my own ears
raise cheers for him when he had sung his ridiculous ode. I have half a
mind to burn their town about their ears so that they may remember my
visit."
