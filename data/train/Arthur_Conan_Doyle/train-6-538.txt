Quick as a flash it passed through his mind that he could not leap
beyond its reach. But he might get within it. In an instant he had
dropped his sword, and springing in he had seized the brazen man round
the waist. The mace was shortened and the handle jobbed down once upon
the bare flaxen head. Then, with a sonorous clang, and a yell of delight
from the spectators, Nigel with one mighty wrench tore his enemy from
the deck and hurled him down upon his back. His own head was whirling
and he felt that his senses were slipping away, but already his
hunting-knife was out and pointing through the slit in the brazen
helmet.
