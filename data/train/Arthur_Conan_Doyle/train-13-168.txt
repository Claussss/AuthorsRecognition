      and have been so for three years. During that time my wife and I

      thought or word or deed. And now, since last Monday, there has
      suddenly sprung up a barrier between us, and I find that there is
      something in her life and in her thought of which I know as
      little as if she were the woman who brushes by me in the street.
      We are estranged, and I want to know why.
