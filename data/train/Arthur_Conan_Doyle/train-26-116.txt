Of course, the genesis of the thing is clear enough. He had chanced
to visit the inn, and had been impressed as I had been by the same
train of thought. All that is quite intelligible. But what is
perfectly marvellous is that in that short journey I should have
chanced to buy the one book in all the world which would prevent
me from making a public fool of myself, for who would ever have
believed that my work was not an imitation? I do not think that
the hypothesis of coincidence can cover the facts. It is one of
several incidents in my life which have convinced me of spiritual
interposition--of the promptings of some beneficent force outside
ourselves, which tries to help us where it can. The old Catholic
doctrine of the Guardian Angel is not only a beautiful one, but
has in it, I believe, a real basis of truth.
