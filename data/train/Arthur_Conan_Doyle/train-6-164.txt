The old dame flushed with pleasure, and then turned white with vexation
at the words. “It is in truth great honor to the house of Loring,” said
she, “yet our roof is now humble and, as you have seen, our fare is
plain. The King knows not that we are so poor. I fear lest we seem
churlish and niggard in his eyes.” But Chandos reasoned away her fears. The King's retinue would journey
on to Farnham Castle. There were no ladies in his party. Though he was
King, still he was a hardy soldier, and cared little for his ease. In
any case, since he had declared his coming, they must make the best
of it. Finally, with all delicacy, Chandos offered his own purse if it
would help in the matter. But already the Lady Ermyntrude had recovered
her composure.
