â€œIt was not until I was in London that it suddenly occurred to me that
I had neglected to shut off the current, and that it would continue to
pass through the bar of bismuth until the batteries were exhausted. The
fact, however, seemed to be of small importance, and I dismissed it from
my mind. I was detained in London until the Tuesday night, and it
was Wednesday morning before I got back to my work. As I unlocked the
laboratory door my mind reverted to the uncompleted experiment, and it
struck me that in all probability my piece of bismuth would have been
entirely disintegrated and reduced to its primitive molecules. I was
utterly unprepared for the truth.
