It has been told elsewhere how as the years passed Nigel's name rose
higher in honor; but still Mary's would keep pace with it, each helping
and sustaining the other upon an ever higher path. In many lands did
Nigel carve his fame, and ever as he returned spent and weary from his
work he drank fresh strength and fire and craving for honor from her
who glorified his home. At Twynham Castle they dwelled for many years,
beloved and honored by all. Then in the fullness of time they came back
to the Tilford Manor-house and spent their happy, healthy age amid those
heather downs where Nigel had passed his first lusty youth, ere ever he
turned his face to the wars. Thither also came Aylward when he had left
the “Pied Merlin” where for many a year he sold ale to the men of the
forest.
