But above all, brain, energy, character, driving power, if exerted for
good, makes a man a leader there as here, while unselfishness, patience
and spirituality there, as here, qualify the soul for the higher
places, which have often been won by those very tribulations down here
which seem so purposeless and so cruel, and are in truth our chances of
spiritual quickening and promotion, without which life would have been
barren and without profit.
