I have heard from the Mardens that they will be back the day after
to-morrow.  I do not know whether I am glad or sorry.  They were safe
in London.  Once here they may be drawn into the miserable network in
which I am myself struggling.  And I must tell them of it.  I cannot
marry Agatha so long as I know that I am not responsible for my own
actions.  Yes, I must tell them, even if it brings every thing to an
end between us.
