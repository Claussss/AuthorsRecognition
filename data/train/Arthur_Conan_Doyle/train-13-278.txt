      It appeared from its position in the paper to have been the one
      event of importance in town, and the account of it ran in this
      way:       “A desperate attempt at robbery, culminating in the death of one
      man and the capture of the criminal, occurred this afternoon in
      the City. For some time back Mawson & Williams, the famous
      financial house, have been the guardians of securities which
      amount in the aggregate to a sum of considerably over a million
      sterling. So conscious was the manager of the responsibility
      which devolved upon him in consequence of the great interests at
      stake that safes of the very latest construction have been
      employed, and an armed watchman has been left day and night in
      the building. It appears that last week a new clerk named Hall
      Pycroft was engaged by the firm. This person appears to have been
      none other than Beddington, the famous forger and cracksman, who,
      with his brother, had only recently emerged from a five years’
      spell of penal servitude. By some means, which are not yet clear,
      he succeeded in winning, under a false name, this official
      position in the office, which he utilised in order to obtain
      moulding of various locks, and a thorough knowledge of the
      position of the strong room and the safes.
