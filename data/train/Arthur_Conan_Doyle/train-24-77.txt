“You are weak, mother,” said he. “Hast journeyed far, I wot.” “From Wiltshire, friend,” said she, in a quavering voice; “three days
have I been on the road. I go to my son, who is one of the King's
regarders at Brockenhurst. He has ever said that he would care for me in
mine old age.” “And rightly too, mother, since you cared for him in his youth. But when
have you broken fast?” “At Lyndenhurst; but alas! my money is at an end, and I could but get a
dish of bran-porridge from the nunnery. Yet I trust that I may be able
to reach Brockenhurst to-night, where I may have all that heart can
desire; for oh! sir, but my son is a fine man, with a kindly heart of
his own, and it is as good as food to me to think that he should have a
doublet of Lincoln green to his back and be the King's own paid man.”
