      â€œWell, I told you just now that there is a cottage not far from
      our house. There is just a field between us, but to reach it you
      have to go along the road and then turn down a lane. Just beyond
      it is a nice little grove of Scotch firs, and I used to be very
      fond of strolling down there, for trees are always a neighbourly
      kind of things. The cottage had been standing empty this eight
      months, and it was a pity, for it was a pretty two-storied place,
      with an old-fashioned porch and honeysuckle about it. I have
      stood many a time and thought what a neat little homestead it
      would make.
