So it came about that Nigel, with his lion heart and with the blood of
a hundred soldiers thrilling in his veins, still at the age of two and
twenty, wasted the weary days reclaiming his hawks with leash and lure
or training the alans and spaniels who shared with the family the big
earthen-floored hall of the manor-house. Day by day the aged Lady Ermyntrude had seen him wax in strength and in
manhood, small of stature, it is true, but with muscles of steel--and a
soul of fire. From all parts, from the warden of Guildford Castle, from
the tilt-yard of Farnham, tales of his prowess were brought back to her,
of his daring as a rider, of his debonair courage, of his skill with all
weapons; but still she, who had both husband and son torn from her by
a bloody death, could not bear that this, the last of the Lorings, the
final bud of so famous an old tree, should share the same fate. With a
weary heart, but with a smiling face, he bore with his uneventful days,
while she would ever put off the evil time until the harvest was better,
until the monks of Waverley should give up what they had taken, until
his uncle should die and leave money for his outfit, or any other excuse
with which she could hold him to her side.
