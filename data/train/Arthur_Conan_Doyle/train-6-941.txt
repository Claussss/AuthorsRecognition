“Nay, fair sir, I have but this moment arrived.” “I was about to ride forth myself to coast their army and observe their
countenance, so come with me ere the night fall, and we shall see what
we can of their order and dispositions.” There was a truce betwixt the two forces for the day, on account of the
ill-advised and useless interposition of the Cardinal of Perigord, Hence
when Chandos and Nigel had pushed their horses through the long hedge
which fronted the position they found that many small parties of the
knights of either army were riding up and down on the plain outside. The
greater number of these groups were French, since it was very necessary
for them to know as much as possible of the English defenses; and many
of their scouts had ridden up to within a hundred yards of the hedge,
where they were sternly ordered back by the pickets of archers on guard.
