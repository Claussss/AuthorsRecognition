“She hath gone forth, father.” “She ever doth go forth when there is a chance of learning aught that is
useful indoors. But supper will soon be ready, and there is a boar's
ham fresh from the forest with which I would ask your help, Nigel, and
a side of venison from the King's own chase. The tinemen and verderers
have not forgotten me yet, and my larder is ever full. Blow three moots
on the horn, Mary, that the varlets may set the table, for the growing
shadow and my loosening belt warn me that it is time.”
