"Ave!" cried the voices. "Ave Maximinus Augustus!" High upon their bucklers stood the giant, and looked round him at the
great floor of up-turned faces below. His own savage soul was stirred by
the clamour, but only his gleaming eyes spoke of the fire within. He
waved his hand to the shouting soldiers as the huntsman waves to the
leaping pack. They passed him up a coronet of oak leaves, and clashed
their swords in homage as he placed it on his head. And then there came
a swirl in the crowd before him, a little space was cleared, and there
knelt an officer in the Pr√¶torian garb, blood upon his face, blood upon
his bared forearm, blood upon his naked sword. Licinius too had gone
with the tide.
