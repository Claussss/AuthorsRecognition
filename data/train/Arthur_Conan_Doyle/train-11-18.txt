From the voices and the steps there seemed now to be several people
round me. I understand Italian a great deal better than I speak it, and
I could make out very well what they were saying. “You have not killed him, Matteo?” “What matter if I have?” “My faith, you will have to answer for it to the tribunal.” “They will kill him, will they not?” “Yes, but it is not for you or me to take it out of their hands.”
