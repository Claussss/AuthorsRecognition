“I think, Robert,” he said, disregarding his daughter's protest, “that
I will have a drop, just the very smallest possible drop, of brandy. A
mere thimbleful will do; but I rather think I have caught cold during
the snowstorm to-day.” Robert went on sketching stolidly in his folding book, but Laura looked
up from her work. “I'm afraid there is nothing in the house, father,” she said. “Laura! Laura!” He shook his head as one more in sorrow than in anger.
“You are no longer a girl, Laura; you are a woman, the manager of a
household, Laura. We trust in you. We look entirely towards you. And yet
you leave your poor brother Robert without any brandy, to say nothing of
me, your father. Good heavens, Laura! what would your mother have said?
Think of accidents, think of sudden illness, think of apoplectic fits,
Laura. It is a very grave res--a very grave response--a very great risk
that you run.”
