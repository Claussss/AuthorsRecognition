‘And I remember well now where I have heard your name,’ said I. ‘Were
you not a captive in the Duke of Beaufort’s prison at Badminton, and did
you not succeed in escaping from the old Boteler dungeon?’ ‘Nay, gentlemen,’ he replied, seating himself on the edge of the table,
and carelessly swinging his legs, ‘since ye know so much it would be
folly for me to attempt to deceive ye. I am indeed the same Hector Marot
who hath made his name a terror on the great Western road, and who hath
seen the inside of more prisons than any man in the south. With truth,
however, I can say that though I have been ten years upon the roads, I
have never yet taken a groat from the poor, or injured any man who did
not wish to injure me. On the contrary, I have often risked life and
limb to save those who were in trouble.’
