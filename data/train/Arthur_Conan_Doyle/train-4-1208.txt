‘His Grace the Duke of Monmouth honoured in his progress in the West of
England, in an account of an extraordinary cure of the king’s evil. ‘Given in a letter from Crewkhorn, in Somerset, from the minister of the
parish and many others. ‘We, whose names are underwritten, do certify the miraculous cure of
a girl of this town, about twenty, by name Elizabeth Parcet, a poor
widow’s daughter, who hath languished under sad affliction from that
distemper of the king’s evil termed the joint evil, being said to be
the worst evil. For about ten or twelve years’ time she had in her right
hand four running wounds, one on the inside, three on the back of her
hand, as well as two more in the same arm, one above her hand-wrist,
the other above the bending of her arm. She had betwixt her arm-pits a
swollen bunch, which the doctors said fed those six running wounds. She
had the same distemper also on her left eye, so she was almost blind.
Her mother, despairing of preserving her sight, and being not of ability
to send her to London to be touched by the king, being miserably poor,
having many poor children, and this girl not being able to work, her
mother, desirous to have her daughter cured, sent to the chirurgeons for
help, who tampered with it for some time, but could do no good. She
went likewise ten or eleven miles to a seventh son, but all in vain. No
visible hopes remained, and she expected nothing but the grave.
