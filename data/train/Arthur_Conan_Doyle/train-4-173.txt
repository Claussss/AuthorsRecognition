‘Why say you that, then?’ ‘Lest he claim a half of whatever booty I may chance to gain. What saith
my learned Fleming under the heading “an qui militi equum praebuit,
praedae ab eo captae particeps esse debeat?” which signifieth “whether
he who lendeth a horse hath a claim on the plunder of him who borroweth
it.” In this discourse he cites a case wherein a Spanish commander
having lent a steed to one of his captains, and the said captain having
captured the general of the enemy, the commander did sue him for a
half share of the twenty thousand crowns which formed the ransom of the
prisoner. A like case is noted by the famous Petrinus Bellus in his book
“De Re Militari,” much read by leaders of repute.’ (Note C. Appendix.)
