‘I have a report to make, Colonel,’ said Reuben, hurrying breathlessly
up to us. ‘You may remember that I and my company were placed on guard
this day at the eastern gates?’ Saxon nodded. ‘Being desirous of seeing all that I could of the enemy, I clambered up
a lofty tree which stands just without the town. From this post, by the
aid of a glass, I was able to make out their lines and camp. Whilst I
was gazing I chanced to observe a man slinking along under cover of the
birch-trees half-way between their lines and the town. Watching him, I
found that he was indeed moving in our direction. Presently he came so
near that I was able to distinguish who it was--for it was one whom I
know--but instead of entering the town by my gate he walked round under
cover of the peat cuttings, and so made his way doubtless to some other
entrance. He is a man, however, who I have reason to believe has no true
love for the cause, and it is my belief that he hath been to the
Royal camp with news of our doings, and hath now come back for further
information.’
