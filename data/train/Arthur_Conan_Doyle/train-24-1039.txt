“Nay, by Saint Paul! it were pity if so many brave men were drawn
together, and no little deed of arms to come of it. Ha! William, they
advance upon us; and, by my soul! it is a sight that is worth coming
over the seas to see.” As he spoke, the two wings of the Spanish host, consisting of the
Knights of Calatrava on the one side and of Santiago upon the other,
came swooping swiftly down the valley, while the main body followed more
slowly behind. Five hundred paces from the English the two great bodies
of horse crossed each other, and, sweeping round in a curve, retired
in feigned confusion towards their centre. Often in bygone wars had the
Moors tempted the hot-blooded Spaniards from their places of strength by
such pretended flights, but there were men upon the hill to whom every
ruse and trick of war were as their daily trade and practice. Again and
even nearer came the rallying Spaniards, and again with cry of fear
and stooping bodies they swerved off to right and left, but the English
still stood stolid and observant among their rocks. The vanguard halted
a long bow shot from the hill, and with waving spears and vaunting
shouts challenged their enemies to come forth, while two cavaliers,
pricking forward from the glittering ranks, walked their horses slowly
between the two arrays with targets braced and lances in rest like the
challengers in a tourney.
