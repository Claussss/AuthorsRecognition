The drama beneath them was rapidly approaching its climax. The Haifa
Corps was well up, and a ring of smoke and flame surrounded the clump
of kneeling Dervishes, who answered it as best they could. Many of them
were already down, but the rest loaded and fired with the unflinching
courage which has always made them worthy antagonists. A dozen
kharki-dressed figures upon the sand showed that it was no bloodless
victory for the Egyptians. But now there was a stirring bugle-call from
the Sarras men, and another answered it from the Haifa Corps. Their
camels were down also, and the men had formed up into a single long
curved line. One last volley and they were charging inwards with the
wild inspiriting yell which the blacks had brought with them from their
central African wilds. For a minute there was a mad vortex of rushing
figures, rifle-butts rising and falling, spearheads gleaming and darting
among the rolling dust cloud. Then the bugle rang out once more, the
Egyptians fell back and formed up with the quick precision of highly
disciplined troops, and there in the centre, each upon his sheepskin,
lay the gallant barbarian and his raiders. The nineteenth century had
been revenged upon the seventh.
