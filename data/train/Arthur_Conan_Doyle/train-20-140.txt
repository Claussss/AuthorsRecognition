      “Well, Mr. Holmes, what do you make of these?” he cried. “They
      told me that you were fond of queer mysteries, and I don’t think
      you can find a queerer one than that. I sent the paper on ahead,
      so that you might have time to study it before I came.”       “It is certainly rather a curious production,” said Holmes. “At
      first sight it would appear to be some childish prank. It
      consists of a number of absurd little figures dancing across the
      paper upon which they are drawn. Why should you attribute any
      importance to so grotesque an object?”
