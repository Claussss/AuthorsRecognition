‘Ha, here is Buyse!’ cried Saxon joyously, as the huge German ploughed
his way through the crowd. ‘And Lord Grey, too! We must save the
Cathedral, my lord! They would sack and burn it.’ ‘This way, gentlemen,’ cried an old grey-haired man, running out towards
us with hands outspread, and a bunch of keys clanking at his girdle. ‘Oh
hasten, gentlemen, if ye can indeed prevail over these lawless men! They
have pulled down Saint Peter, and they will have Paul down too unless
help comes. There will not be an apostle left. The east window is
broken. They have brought a hogshead of beer, and are broaching it
upon the high altar. Oh, alas, alas! That such things should be in a
Christian land!’ He sobbed aloud and stamped about in a very frenzy of
grief.
