      It was almost dark before we found ourselves in Pall Mall, at the
      rooms of Mr. Melas. A gentleman had just called for him, and he
      was gone.       “Can you tell me where?” asked Mycroft Holmes.       “I don’t know, sir,” answered the woman who had opened the door;
      “I only know that he drove away with the gentleman in a
      carriage.”       “Did the gentleman give a name?”       “No, sir.”
