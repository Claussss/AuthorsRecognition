“It is not for my lips to name it unless by his desire. But I beg and
pray you, gentlemen, that you will go from my house, for I know not what
may come of it if his rage should gain the mastery of him.” “By Saint Paul!” lisped Sir Nigel, “this is certainly a man whom it
is worth journeying far to know. Go tell him that a humble knight of
England would make his further honorable acquaintance, not from any
presumption, pride, or ill-will, but for the advancement of chivalry and
the glory of our ladies. Give him greeting from Sir Nigel Loring, and
say that the glove which I bear in my cap belongs to the most peerless
and lovely of her sex, whom I am now ready to uphold against any lady
whose claim he might be desirous of advancing.”
