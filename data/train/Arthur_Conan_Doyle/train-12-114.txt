“I never saw anything more lovely,” continued Laura, loftily overlooking
the remarks of the driver. “It has been a very great pleasure to me
to see it, and I hope that you will tell Mr. Haw so if you see him,
Robert.” “The horses are very restive,” said her brother. “Perhaps, Laura, if you
have seen enough, it would be as well to let them go.” She bowed in the regal fashion which she had so suddenly adopted. Robert
shouted the order, the driver sprang up, his comrades let the horses
go, and away rattled the waggon and the trolly with half the Tamfielders
streaming vainly behind it.
