The earlier castles had a set purpose, for they were built that the
invaders might hold down the country; but when the Conquest was once
firmly established a castle had lost its meaning save as a refuge from
justice or as a center for civil strife. On the marches of Wales and of
Scotland the castle might continue to be a bulwark to the kingdom,
and there still grew and flourished; but in all other places they were
rather a menace to the King's majesty, and as such were discouraged and
destroyed. By the reign of the third Edward the greater part of the old
fighting castles had been converted into dwelling-houses or had been
ruined in the civil wars, and left where their grim gray bones are still
littered upon the brows of our hills. The new buildings were either
great country-houses, capable of defense, but mainly residential, or
they were manor-houses with no military significance at all.
