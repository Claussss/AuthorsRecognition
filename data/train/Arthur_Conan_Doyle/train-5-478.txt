Now, with so fine an electrical supply, it seemed to be a sinful waste
of hemp that the Los Amigos criminals should perish in the
old-fashioned manner.  And then came the news of the eleotrocutions in
the East, and how the results had not after all been so instantaneous
as had been hoped.  The Western Engineers raised their eyebrows when
they read of the puny shocks by which these men had perished, and they
vowed in Los Amigos that when an irreclaimable came their way he should
be dealt handsomely by, and have the run of all the big dynamos.  There
should be no reserve, said the engineers, but he should have all that
they had got.  And what the result of that would be none could predict,
save that it must be absolutely blasting and deadly.  Never before had
a man been so charged with electricity as they would charge him.  He
was to be smitten by the essence of ten thunderbolts.  Some prophesied
combustion, and some disintegration and disappearance.   They were
waiting eagerly to settle the question by actual demonstration, and it
was just at that moment that Duncan Warner came that way.
