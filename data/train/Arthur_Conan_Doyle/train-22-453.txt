It was a Saturday evening in May. Saturday was always the lodge night,
and McMurdo was leaving his house to attend it when Morris, the weaker
brother of the order, came to see him. His brow was creased with care,
and his kindly face was drawn and haggard. “Can I speak with you freely, Mr. McMurdo?” “I can't forget that I spoke my heart to you once, and that you kept it
to yourself, even though the Boss himself came to ask you about it.”
