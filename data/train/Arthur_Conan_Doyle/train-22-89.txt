“The gun was made to conceal. That's why the barrels were sawed. It
would fit into any box. How could he swear there was no such gun in the
house?” “Well, anyhow, he had never seen one.” MacDonald shook his obstinate Scotch head. “I'm not convinced yet
that there was ever anyone in the house,” said he. “I'm asking you to
conseedar” (his accent became more Aberdonian as he lost himself in his
argument) “I'm asking you to conseedar what it involves if you suppose
that this gun was ever brought into the house, and that all these
strange things were done by a person from outside. Oh, man, it's just
inconceivable! It's clean against common sense! I put it to you, Mr.
Holmes, judging it by what we have heard.”
