At the farther end the light beat strongly upon the harsh face and the
high-drawn misshapen shoulders of the lord of the house. A tangle
of black hair surmounted a high rounded forehead, the forehead of a
thinker, with two deep-set cold gray eyes twinkling sharply from under
tufted brows. His nose was curved and sharp, like the beak of some cruel
bird, but below the whole of his clean-shaven powerful face was marred
by the loose slabbing mouth and the round folds of the heavy chin.
His knife in one hand and a half-gnawed bone in the other, he looked
fiercely up, like some beast disturbed in his den, as the two intruders
broke in upon his hall.
