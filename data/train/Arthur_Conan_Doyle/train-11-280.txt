“So you've brought your bully with you, Ned?” said he. “You might at
least have done your fighting yourself, if it must come to a fight.” “So I will,” cried Lord Rufton. “Here and now.” “When I've killed this swaggering Frenchman,” said Lord Dacre. He
stepped to a side table and opened a brass-bound case. “By Gad,” said
he, “either that man or I go out of this room feet foremost. I meant
well by you, Ned; I did, by George, but I'll shoot this led-captain of
yours as sure as my name's George Dacre. Take your choice of pistols,
sir, and shoot across this table. The barkers are loaded. Aim straight
and kill me if you can, for by the Lord if you don't, you're done.”
