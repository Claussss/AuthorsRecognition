“I've nothing more to say to you, except that when my time comes I'll
die the easier when I think of the work I have done in this valley. Now,
Marvin, I'll keep you no more. Take them in and get it over.” There is little more to tell. Scanlan had been given a sealed note to
be left at the address of Miss Ettie Shafter, a mission which he had
accepted with a wink and a knowing smile. In the early hours of the
morning a beautiful woman and a much muffled man boarded a special train
which had been sent by the railroad company, and made a swift, unbroken
journey out of the land of danger. It was the last time that ever either
Ettie or her lover set foot in the Valley of Fear. Ten days later
they were married in Chicago, with old Jacob Shafter as witness of the
wedding.
