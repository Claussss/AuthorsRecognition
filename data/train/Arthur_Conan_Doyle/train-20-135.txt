      “I am.”       “I ought to make you sign a paper to that effect.”       “Why?”       “Because in five minutes you will say that it is all so absurdly
      simple.”       “I am sure that I shall say nothing of the kind.”       “You see, my dear Watson,”—he propped his test-tube in the rack,
      and began to lecture with the air of a professor addressing his
      class—“it is not really difficult to construct a series of
      inferences, each dependent upon its predecessor and each simple
      in itself. If, after doing so, one simply knocks out all the
      central inferences and presents one’s audience with the
      starting-point and the conclusion, one may produce a startling,
      though possibly a meretricious, effect. Now, it was not really

      forefinger and thumb, to feel sure that you did _not_ propose to
      invest your small capital in the gold fields.”
