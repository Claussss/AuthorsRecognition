end." "But surely," I cried, "you will give me some reason!  This is unlike
you, Agatha.  Tell me how I have been unfortunate enough to offend you." "It is all over, Austin." "But why?  You must be under some delusion, Agatha.  Perhaps you have
been told some falsehood about me.  Or you may have misunderstood
something that I have said to you.  Only let me know what it is, and a
word may set it all right."
