But now at last the supports had come. Lights flashed and armor gleamed
down the tunnel. The cellar filled with armed men, while from above
came the cries and turmoil of the feigned assault upon the gate. Led
by Knolles and Nigel, the storming party rushed upward and seized the
courtyard. The guard of the gate taken in the rear threw down their
weapons and cried for mercy. The gate was thrown open and the assailants
rushed in, with hundreds of furious peasants at their heels. Some of the
robbers died in hot blood, many in cold; but all died, for Knolles had
vowed to give no quarter. Day was just breaking when the last fugitive
had been hunted out and slain. From all sides came the yells and whoops
of the soldiers with the rending and riving of doors as they burst
into the store-rooms and treasure-chambers. There was a joyous scramble
amongst them, for the plunder of eleven years, gold and jewels, satins
and velvets, rich plate and noble hangings were all to be had for the
taking.
