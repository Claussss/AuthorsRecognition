“And where?” “I marked a fitting place even as I rode here this evening. If you cross
the river and take the bridle-path through the fields which leads to
Josselin you come midway upon a mighty oak standing at the corner of a
fair and level meadow. There let us meet at midday to-morrow.” “Agreed!” cried Bambro'. “But I pray you not to rise, Robert! The night
is still young and the spices and hippocras will soon be served. Bide
with us, I pray you, for if you would fain hear the latest songs from
England, these gentlemen have doubtless brought them. To some of us
perchance it is the last night, so we would make it a full one.”
