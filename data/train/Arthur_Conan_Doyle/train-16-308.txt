And now the child is himself a medical man, and yet Dr. Winter is the
same as ever. I can see no change since first I can remember him, save
that perhaps the brindled hair is a trifle whiter, and the huge
shoulders a little more bowed. He is a very tall man, though he loses a
couple of inches from his stoop. That big back of his has curved itself
over sick beds until it has set in that shape. His face is of a walnut
brown, and tells of long winter drives over bleak country roads with the
wind and the rain in his teeth. It looks smooth at a little distance,
but as you approach him you see that it is shot with innumerable fine
wrinkles, like a last year's apple. They are hardly to be seen when he
is in repose, but when he laughs his face breaks like a starred glass,
and you realise then that, though he looks old, he must be older than he
looks.
