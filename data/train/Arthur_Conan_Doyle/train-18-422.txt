“J. B. HEATHERSTONE.” It was going on for dawn by the time that I had finished this
extraordinary narrative, to which my sister and Mordaunt Heatherstone
listened with the most absorbed attention. Already we could see through
the window that the stars had begun to fade and a grey light to appear
in the east. The crofter who owned the lurcher dog lived a couple of
miles off, so it was time for us to be on foot. Leaving Esther to tell
my father the story in such fashion as she might, we thrust some food in
our pockets and set off upon our solemn and eventful errand.
