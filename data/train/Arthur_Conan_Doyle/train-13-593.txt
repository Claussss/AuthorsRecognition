      Mycroft Holmes was a much larger and stouter man than Sherlock.
      His body was absolutely corpulent, but his face, though massive,
      had preserved something of the sharpness of expression which was
      so remarkable in that of his brother. His eyes, which were of a
      peculiarly light, watery grey, seemed to always retain that
      far-away, introspective look which I had only observed in
      Sherlockâ€™s when he was exerting his full powers.
