words, come what may, to be back at sundown, for your companies must

drop in his presence some words as to the plans for the night, while we
set off at once for our post. Our horses we left behind, and slipping
out through the eastern gate we made our way over bog and moor,
concealing ourselves as best we could, until we came out upon the lonely
roadway, and found ourselves in front of the house.
