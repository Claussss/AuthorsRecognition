      “I used to have a billet at Coxon & Woodhouse, of Drapers’
      Gardens, but they were let in early in the spring through the
      Venezuelan loan, as no doubt you remember, and came a nasty
      cropper. I had been with them five years, and old Coxon gave me a
      ripping good testimonial when the smash came, but of course we
      clerks were all turned adrift, the twenty-seven of us. I tried
      here and tried there, but there were lots of other chaps on the
      same lay as myself, and it was a perfect frost for a long time. I
      had been taking three pounds a week at Coxon’s, and I had saved
      about seventy of them, but I soon worked my way through that and
      out at the other end. I was fairly at the end of my tether at
      last, and could hardly find the stamps to answer the
      advertisements or the envelopes to stick them to. I had worn out
      my boots paddling up office stairs, and I seemed just as far from
      getting a billet as ever.
