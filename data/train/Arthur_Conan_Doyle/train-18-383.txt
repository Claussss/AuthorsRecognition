We set out, then, as per programme, and came upon the camp near the head
of the valley. They had two weak companies of the 54th with them who
might no doubt have held their own with warning, but an unexpected rush
of wild Hillmen is a very difficult thing to stand against. With our
reinforcements, however, and on our guard, we might defy the rascals. Chamberlain was in command--a fine young fellow. We soon made him
understand the situation, and were all ready for a start by daybreak
though his waggons were so full that we were compelled to leave several
tons of fodder behind in order to make room for my Sepoys and for the
artillery.
