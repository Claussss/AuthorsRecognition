“Father Abbot!” he cried. “Alas, alas! Brother John is dead, and the
holy subprior is dead, and the Devil is loose in the five-virgate
field!” 
III. THE YELLOW HORSE OF CROOKSBURY 
In those simple times there was a great wonder and mystery in life. Man
walked in fear and solemnity, with Heaven very close above his head,
and Hell below his very feet. God's visible hand was everywhere, in the
rainbow and the comet, in the thunder and the wind. The Devil too raged
openly upon the earth; he skulked behind the hedge-rows in the gloaming;
he laughed loudly in the night-time; he clawed the dying sinner, pounced
on the unbaptized babe, and twisted the limbs of the epileptic. A foul
fiend slunk ever by a man's side and whispered villainies in his ear,
while above him there hovered an angel of grace who pointed to the steep
and narrow track. How could one doubt these things, when Pope and priest
and scholar and King were all united in believing them, with no single
voice of question in the whole wide world?
