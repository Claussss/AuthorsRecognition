A general chorus of approval from the whole council showed that the
prospect of at last coming to an engagement was welcome, after the weary
marchings and delays of the last few weeks. ‘Has any cavalier anything to say against this plan?’ asked the King. We all looked from one to the other, but though many faces were doubtful
or desponding, none had a word to say against the night attack, for it
was clear that our action in any case must be hazardous, and this had at
least the merit of promising a better chance of success than any other.
Yet, my dears, I dare say the boldest of us felt a sinking at the heart
as we looked at our downcast, sad-faced leader, and asked ourselves
whether this was a likely man to bring so desperate an enterprise to a
success.
