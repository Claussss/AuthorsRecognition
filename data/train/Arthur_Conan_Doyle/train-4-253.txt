The strange dwelling into which we presently entered had been prolonged
into the side of the little hill against which it had been built, so
as to form a very long narrow hall. The ends of this great room, as we
entered, were wrapped in shadow, but in the centre was a bright glare
from a brazier full of coals, over which a brass pipkin was suspended.
Beside the fire a long wooden table was plentifully covered with curved
glass flasks, basins, tubings, and other instruments of which I knew
neither the name nor the purpose. A long row of bottles containing
various coloured liquids and powders were arranged along a shelf, whilst
above it another shelf bore a goodly array of brown volumes. For the
rest there was a second rough-hewn table, a pair of cupboards, three or
four wooden settles, and several large screens pinned to the walls
and covered all over with figures and symbols, of which I could make
nothing. The vile smell which had greeted us outside was very much worse
within the chamber, and arose apparently from the fumes of the boiling,
bubbling contents of the brazen pot.
