And yet another outrage! It was bad that this creature should
still cling so tight upon his back, but now he would even go to the
intolerable length of checking him and guiding him on the way that he
would have him go. There was a sharp pluck at his mouth, and his head
was turned north once more. As well go that way as another, but the man
was mad indeed if he thought that such a horse as Pommers was at the
end of his spirit or his strength. He would soon show him that he was
unconquered, if it strained his sinews or broke his heart to do so. Back
then he flew up the long, long ascent. Would he ever get to the end of
it? Yet he would not own that he could go no farther while the man still
kept his grip. He was white with foam and caked with mud. His eyes were
gorged with blood, his mouth open and gasping, his nostrils expanded,
his coat stark and reeking. On he flew down the long Sunday Hill until
he reached the deep Kingsley Marsh at the bottom. No, it was too much!
Flesh and blood could go no farther. As he struggled out from the reedy
slime with the heavy black mud still clinging to his fetlocks, he at
last eased down with sobbing breath and slowed the tumultuous gallop to
a canter.
