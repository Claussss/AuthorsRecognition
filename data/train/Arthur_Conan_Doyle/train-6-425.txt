sacrist of Waverley,” said Aylward. “Out he will go on the roadside,
honor and all, if he does not find ten nobles by next Epiphany. But if I
could win a ransom or be at the storming of a rich city, then indeed the
old man would be proud of me. 'Thy sword must help my spade, Samkin,'
said he as he kissed me goodby. Ah! it would indeed be a happy day for
him and for all if I could ride back with a saddle-bag full of gold
pieces, and please God, I shall dip my hand in somebody's pocket before
I see Crooksbury Hill once more!”
