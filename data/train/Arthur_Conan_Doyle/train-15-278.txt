years you will strive, and then you will win, and victory will bring
rest to others, but only new troubles to you. Ah!" The prophetess
suddenly started in violent surprise, and her hand made ever faster
markings on the sand. "What is it that ails you, Alaga?" asked the priest. The woman had looked up with wild inquiring eyes. Her gaze was neither
for the priest nor for the chief, but shot past them to the further
door. Looking round the Greek was aware that two new figures had entered
the room. They were the ruddy barbarian whom he had marked in the
street, together with the youth who bore his harp.
