“By St. Paul!” said the knight, “our good merchant of Southampton hath
not played us false, for methinks I can see our ship down yonder. He
said that she would be of great size and of a yellow shade.” “By my hilt, yes!” muttered Aylward; “she is yellow as a kite's claw,
and would carry as many men as there are pips in a pomegranate.” “It is as well,” remarked Terlake; “for methinks, my fair lord, that
we are not the only ones who are waiting a passage to Gascony. Mine eye
catches at times a flash and sparkle among yonder houses which assuredly
never came from shipman's jacket or the gaberdine of a burgher.”
