“What then?” asked the knight, peering up at him anxiously. “There is
nought amiss with the Lady Mary or with the Lady Maude?” “It is my brother--my poor unhappy brother!” cried Alleyne, with his
hand to his brow. “He is dead.” “By Saint Paul! I have never heard that he had shown so much love for
you that you should mourn him so.” “Yet he was my brother--the only kith or kin that I had upon earth.
Mayhap he had cause to be bitter against me, for his land was given to
the abbey for my upbringing. Alas! alas! and I raised my staff against
him when last we met! He has been slain--and slain, I fear, amidst crime
and violence.”
