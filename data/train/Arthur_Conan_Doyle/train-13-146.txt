      “It was only a little thing, too. I had come into the parlour
      unexpected, and as I walked in at the door I saw a light of
      welcome on my wife’s face. But as she saw who it was it faded
      again, and she turned away with a look of disappointment. That
      was enough for me. There was no one but Alec Fairbairn whose step
      she could have mistaken for mine. If I could have seen him then I
      should have killed him, for I have always been like a madman when
      my temper gets loose. Mary saw the devil’s light in my eyes, and
      she ran forward with her hands on my sleeve. ‘Don’t, Jim, don’t!’
      says she. ‘Where’s Sarah?’ I asked. ‘In the kitchen,’ says she.
      ‘Sarah,’ says I as I went in, ‘this man Fairbairn is never to
      darken my door again.’ ‘Why not?’ says she. ‘Because I order it.’
      ‘Oh!’ says she, ‘if my friends are not good enough for this
      house, then I am not good enough for it either.’ ‘You can do what
      you like,’ says I, ‘but if Fairbairn shows his face here again
      I’ll send you one of his ears for a keepsake.’ She was frightened
      by my face, I think, for she never answered a word, and the same
      evening she left my house.
