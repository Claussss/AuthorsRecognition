Such was the state of Bambro's garrison when on that March evening
Knolles and his men streamed into the bailey-yard of his Castle. In the glare of the torches at the inner gate Bambro' was waiting to
receive them, a dry, hard, wizened man, small and fierce, with beady
black eyes and quick furtive ways. Beside him, a strange contrast, stood his Squire, Croquart, a German,
whose name and fame as a man-at-arms were widespread, though like Robert
Knolles himself he had begun as a humble page. He was a very tall man,
with an enormous spread of shoulders, and a pair of huge hands with
which he could crack a horse-shoe. He was slow and lethargic, save in
moments of excitement, and his calm blond face, his dreamy blue eyes and
his long fair hair gave him so gentle an appearance that none save those
who had seen him in his berserk mood, raging, an iron giant, in the
forefront of the battle, could ever guess how terrible a warrior he
might be. Little knight and huge squire stood together under the arch of
the donjon and gave welcome to the newcomers, whilst a swarm of soldiers
crowded round to embrace their comrades and to lead them off where they
might feed and make merry together.
