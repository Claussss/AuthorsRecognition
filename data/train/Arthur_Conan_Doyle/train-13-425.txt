      An hour and half had elapsed before the Inspector returned alone.       “Mr. Holmes is walking up and down in the field outside,” said
      he. “He wants us all four to go up to the house together.”       “To Mr. Cunningham’s?”       “Yes, sir.”       “What for?”       The Inspector shrugged his shoulders. “I don’t quite know, sir.
      Between ourselves, I think Mr. Holmes had not quite got over his
      illness yet. He’s been behaving very queerly, and he is very much
      excited.”
