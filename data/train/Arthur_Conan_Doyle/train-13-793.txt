      “My dear Watson,” said a voice, “you have not even condescended
      to say good-morning.”       I turned in uncontrollable astonishment. The aged ecclesiastic
      had turned his face towards me. For an instant the wrinkles were
      smoothed away, the nose drew away from the chin, the lower lip
      ceased to protrude and the mouth to mumble, the dull eyes
      regained their fire, the drooping figure expanded. The next the
      whole frame collapsed again, and Holmes had gone as quickly as he
      had come.
