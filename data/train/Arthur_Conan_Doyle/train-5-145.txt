The door had hardly closed behind him when the two demure young ladies
darted out of their corner, and fluttered with joy in front of the
astonished doctor. "Oh, well done! well done!" cried the taller, clapping her hands. "Don't let him bully you, doctor," said the other.  "Oh, it was so nice
to hear you stand up to him.  That's the way he does with poor Dr.
Mason.  Dr. Mason has never examined mamma yet.  He always takes papa's
word for everything.  Hush, Maude; here he comes again."  They subsided
in an instant into their corner as silent and demure as ever.
