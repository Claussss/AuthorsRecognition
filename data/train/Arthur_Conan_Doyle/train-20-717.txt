      There was a telegraph-office at a short distance from the hotel.
      We halted outside it.       “It’s worth trying, Watson,” said Holmes. “Of course, with a
      warrant we could demand to see the counterfoils, but we have not
      reached that stage yet. I don’t suppose they remember faces in so
      busy a place. Let us venture it.”       “I am sorry to trouble you,” said he, in his blandest manner, to
      the young woman behind the grating; “there is some small mistake
      about a telegram I sent yesterday. I have had no answer, and I
      very much fear that I must have omitted to put my name at the
      end. Could you tell me if this was so?”
