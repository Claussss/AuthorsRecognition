      “His words were quiet, but he had a rasping way of saying them
      which was very menacing. I sat in silence wondering what on earth
      could be his reason for kidnapping me in this extraordinary
      fashion. Whatever it might be, it was perfectly clear that there
      was no possible use in my resisting, and that I could only wait
      to see what might befall.       “For nearly two hours we drove without my having the least clue
      as to where we were going. Sometimes the rattle of the stones
      told of a paved causeway, and at others our smooth, silent course
      suggested asphalt; but, save by this variation in sound, there
      was nothing at all which could in the remotest way help me to
      form a guess as to where we were. The paper over each window was
      impenetrable to light, and a blue curtain was drawn across the
      glass work in front. It was a quarter-past seven when we left
      Pall Mall, and my watch showed me that it was ten minutes to nine
      when we at last came to a standstill. My companion let down the
      window, and I caught a glimpse of a low, arched doorway with a
      lamp burning above it. As I was hurried from the carriage it
      swung open, and I found myself inside the house, with a vague
      impression of a lawn and trees on each side of me as I entered.
      Whether these were private grounds, however, or _bonâ-fide_
      country was more than I could possibly venture to say.
