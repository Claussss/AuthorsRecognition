      “I fear it is too deep a case for such simple remedies,” said
      Holmes. “How long can you stay in London?”       “I must go back to-day. I would not leave my wife alone all night
      for anything. She is very nervous, and begged me to come back.”       “I daresay you are right. But if you could have stopped, I might
      possibly have been able to return with you in a day or two.
      Meanwhile you will leave me these papers, and I think that it is
      very likely that I shall be able to pay you a visit shortly and
      to throw some light upon your case.”
