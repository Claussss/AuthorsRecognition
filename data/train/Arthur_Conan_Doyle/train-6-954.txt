“It had been better for your honor, Sir Eustace, had you held your
peace,” said the Duke of Orleans. “Shall we let them slip from our
fingers when we have them here and are fourfold their number? I know not
where we should dwell afterwards, for I am very sure that we should be
ashamed to ride back to Paris, or to look our ladies in the eyes again.” “Indeed, Eustace, you have done well to say what is in your mind,”
 said the King; “but I have already said that we shall join battle this
morning, so that there is no room here for further talk. But I would
fain have heard from you how it would be wisest and best that we attack
them?”
