As he gazed, he saw of a sudden a man steal forth from the wood into the
open clearing. He walked with his head sunk, his shoulders curved, and
his knees bent, as one who strives hard to remain unseen. Ten paces from
the fringe of trees he glanced around, and waving his hand he crouched
down, and was lost to sight among a belt of furze-bushes. After him
there came a second man, and after him a third, a fourth, and a fifth
stealing across the narrow open space and darting into the shelter of
the brushwood. Nine-and-seventy Alleyne counted of these dark figures
flitting across the line of the moonlight. Many bore huge burdens upon
their backs, though what it was that they carried he could not tell at
the distance. Out of the one wood and into the other they passed, all
with the same crouching, furtive gait, until the black bristle of trees
had swallowed up the last of them.
