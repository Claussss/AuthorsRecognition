And now as they rode onwards they saw one of the most singular of
the phenomena of the Egyptian desert in front of them, though the ill
treatment of their companion had left them in no humour for appreciating
its beauty. When the sun had sunk, the horizon had remained of a
slaty-violet hue. But now this began to lighten and to brighten until a
curious false dawn developed, and it seemed as if a vacillating sun was
coming back along the path which it had just abandoned. A rosy pink hung
over the west, with beautifully delicate sea-green tints along the upper
edge of it. Slowly these faded into slate again, and the night had come.
It was but twenty-four hours since they had sat in their canvas chairs
discussing politics by starlight on the saloon deck of the _Korosko_;
only twelve since they had breakfasted there and had started spruce and
fresh upon their last pleasure trip. What a world of fresh impressions
had come upon them since then! How rudely they had been jostled out of
their take-it-for-granted complacency! The same shimmering silver stars
as they had looked upon last night, the same thin crescent of moon--but
they, what a chasm lay between that old pampered life and this!
