“By my faith!” said Ford, “we do not need a guide to lead us to their
presence.” As he spoke there came a roar of singing from the tavern upon
the right, with shouts of laughter and stamping of feet. Passing under
a low door, and down a stone-flagged passage, they found themselves in a
long narrow hall lit up by a pair of blazing torches, one at either end.
Trusses of straw had been thrown down along the walls, and reclining on
them were some twenty or thirty archers, all of the Company, their
steel caps and jacks thrown off, their tunics open and their great limbs
sprawling upon the clay floor. At every man's elbow stood his leathern
blackjack of beer, while at the further end a hogshead with its end
knocked in promised an abundant supply for the future. Behind the
hogshead, on a half circle of kegs, boxes, and rude settles, sat
Aylward, John, Black Simon and three or four other leading men of the
archers, together with Goodwin Hawtayne, the master-shipman, who had
left his yellow cog in the river to have a last rouse with his friends
of the Company. Ford and Alleyne took their seats between Aylward and
Black Simon, without their entrance checking in any degree the hubbub
which was going on.
