this?’ During this talk the long column of foot had tramped past, still bearing
the banners which they had brought with them to the wars, though much

our foot that we must rely. On the tops of the low hills all round the
frequent shimmer of arms, glancing here and there when the sun’s rays
struck upon them, showed how strong our enemies were in the very point
in which we were so weak. Yet in the main this Wells review was cheering
to us, as showing that the men kept in good heart, and that there was no
ill-feeling at the rough handling of the zealots upon the day before.
