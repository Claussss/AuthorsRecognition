“I thank you,” said McMurdo, and shaking hands with his new acquaintance
he plodded, gripsack in hand, up the path which led to the dwelling
house, at the door of which he gave a resounding knock. It was opened at once by someone very different from what he had
expected. It was a woman, young and singularly beautiful. She was of the
German type, blonde and fair-haired, with the piquant contrast of a
pair of beautiful dark eyes with which she surveyed the stranger with
surprise and a pleasing embarrassment which brought a wave of colour
over her pale face. Framed in the bright light of the open doorway, it
seemed to McMurdo that he had never seen a more beautiful picture;
the more attractive for its contrast with the sordid and gloomy
surroundings. A lovely violet growing upon one of those black slag-heaps
of the mines would not have seemed more surprising. So entranced was
he that he stood staring without a word, and it was she who broke the
silence.
