“Brave young signor,” cried the tall man, throwing his arms round
Alleyne, “how can we thank you enough for taking our parts against those
horrible drunken barbarians. What should we have done without you? My
Tita would have been dragged away, and my head would have been shivered
into a thousand fragments.” “Nay, I scarce think that they would have mishandled you so,” said
Alleyne in surprise. “Ho, ho!” cried he with a high crowing laugh, “it is not the head upon
my shoulders that I think of. Cospetto! no. It is the head under my arm
which you have preserved.”
