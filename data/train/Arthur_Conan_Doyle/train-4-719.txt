or the border counties, zur, that be very clear.’ ‘I am a Hampshire man,’ said I. ‘I have come some distance to see the
Duke.’ ‘Aye, so I should think!’ he cried, laughing loudly. ‘If you doan’t know
the way to Badminton you doan’t know much! But I’ll go with you, danged
if I doan’t, and I’ll show you your road, and run my chance o’ finding
the Duke there. What be your name?’
