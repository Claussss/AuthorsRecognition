Their course still lay along the old trade route, but their progress was
very slow, and more than once the two Emirs rode back together and shook
their heads as they looked at the weary baggage-camels on which the
prisoners were perched. The greatest laggard of all was one which was
ridden by a wounded Soudanese soldier. It was limping badly with a
strained tendon, and it was only by constant prodding that it could be
kept with the others. The Emir Wad Ibraham raised his Remington, as the
creature hobbled past, and sent a bullet through its brain. The wounded
man flew forwards out of the high saddle, and fell heavily upon the hard
track. His companions in misfortune, looking back, saw him stagger to
his feet with a dazed face. At the same instant a Baggara slipped down
from his camel with a sword in his hand.
