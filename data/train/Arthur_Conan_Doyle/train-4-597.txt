From my central post by the door I could see the lines of faces on
either side of the board, the solemn close-shaven Puritans, sunburned
soldiers, and white-wigged moustachioed courtiers. My eyes rested
particularly upon Ferguson’s scorbutic features, Saxon’s hard aquiline
profile, the German’s burly face, and the peaky thoughtful countenance
of the Lord of Wark. ‘If naebody else will gie an opeenion,’ cried the fanatical Doctor,
‘I’ll een speak mysel’ as led by the inward voice. For have I no worked
in the cause and slaved in it, much enduring and suffering mony things
at the honds o’ the froward, whereby my ain speerit hath plentifully
fructified? Have I no been bruised as in a wine-press, and cast oot wi’
hissing and scorning into waste places?’
