“This ship was the Christopher, and they placed it in the front of their
battle; but the English closed upon it and stormed over its side, and
slew all who were upon it. “But your father and Sir Lorredan of Genoa, who commanded the
Christopher, fought upon the high poop, so that all the fleet stopped
to watch it, and the King himself cried aloud at the sight, for Sir
Lorredan was a famous man-at-arms and bore himself very stoutly that
day, and many a knight envied your father that he should have chanced
upon so excellent a person. But your father bore him back and struck
him such a blow with a mace that he turned the helmet half round on
his head, so that he could no longer see through the eye holes, and
Sir Lorredan threw down his sword and gave himself to ransom. But your
father took him by the helmet and twisted it until he had it straight
upon his head. Then, when he could see once again, he handed him his
sword, and prayed him that he would rest himself and then continue, for
it was great profit and joy to see any gentleman carry himself so well.
So they sat together and rested by the rail of the poop; but even as
they raised their hands again your father was struck by a stone from a
mangonel and so died.”
