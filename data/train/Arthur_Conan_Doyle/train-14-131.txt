      “That is true.”       “Did Barrymore profit at all by Sir Charles’s will?” asked
      Holmes.       “He and his wife had five hundred pounds each.”       “Ha! Did they know that they would receive this?”       “Yes; Sir Charles was very fond of talking about the provisions
      of his will.”       “That is very interesting.”       “I hope,” said Dr. Mortimer, “that you do not look with
      suspicious eyes upon everyone who received a legacy from Sir
      Charles, for I also had a thousand pounds left to me.”
