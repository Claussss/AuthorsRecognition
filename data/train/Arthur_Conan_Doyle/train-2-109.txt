“Only as a name.” “Its importance can hardly be exaggerated. It has been the most
jealously guarded of all government secrets. You may take it from me

Bruce-Partington’s operation. Two years ago a very large sum was
smuggled through the Estimates and was expended in acquiring a monopoly

burglar-proof doors and windows. Under no conceivable circumstances
were the plans to be taken from the office. If the chief constructor of

point of view it’s simply awful.”
