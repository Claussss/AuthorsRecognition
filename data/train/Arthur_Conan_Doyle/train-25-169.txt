"that your turning up is a considerable relief to us, for our mission
seemed to have come to a premature end.  Even now I can't for the life

manner." Instead of answering, Professor Challenger entered, shook hands with
myself and Lord John, bowed with ponderous insolence to Professor
Summerlee, and sank back into a basket-chair, which creaked and swayed
beneath his weight.
