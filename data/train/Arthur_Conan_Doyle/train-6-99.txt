         A heart!  A heart!  Ah, give me a heart
           To rise to circumstance!
         Serene and high and bold to try
           The hazard of the chance,
         With strength to wait, but fixed as fate
            To plan and dare and do,
         The peer of all, and only thrall,
            Sweet lady mine, to you! It may have been that the sentiment went for more than the music, or it
may have been the nicety of her own ears had been dulled by age, but old
Dame Ermyntrude clapped her lean hands together and cried out in shrill
applause.
