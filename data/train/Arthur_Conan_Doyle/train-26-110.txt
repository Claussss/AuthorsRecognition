And now whom? Nathaniel Hawthorne never appealed in the highest
degree to me. The fault, I am sure, is my own, but I always seemed
to crave stronger fare than he gave me. It was too subtle, too
elusive, for effect. Indeed, I have been more affected by some of
the short work of his son Julian, though I can quite understand the
high artistic claims which the senior writer has, and the delicate
charm of his style. There is Bulwer Lytton as a claimant. His
"Haunted and the Haunters" is the very best ghost story that I know.
As such I should include it in my list. There was a story, too, in
one of the old Blackwoods--"Metempsychosis" it was called, which
left so deep an impression upon my mind that I should be inclined,
though it is many years since I read it, to number it with the best.
Another story which has the characteristics of great work is Grant
Allen's "John Creedy." So good a story upon so philosophic a basis
deserves a place among the best. There is some first-class work
to be picked also from the contemporary work of Wells and of
Quiller-Couch which reaches a high standard. One little sketch--"Old
Oeson" in "Noughts and Crosses"--is, in my opinion, as good as
anything of the kind which I have ever read.
