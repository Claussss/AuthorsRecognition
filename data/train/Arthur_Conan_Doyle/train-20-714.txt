      “Very good, sir,” said Sherlock Holmes. “May I ask, in the
      meanwhile, whether you have yourself any theory to account for
      this young man’s disappearance?”       “No, sir, I have not. He is big enough and old enough to look
      after himself, and if he is so foolish as to lose himself, I
      entirely refuse to accept the responsibility of hunting for him.”       “I quite understand your position,” said Holmes, with a
      mischievous twinkle in his eyes. “Perhaps you don’t quite
      understand mine. Godfrey Staunton appears to have been a poor
      man. If he has been kidnapped, it could not have been for
      anything which he himself possesses. The fame of your wealth has
      gone abroad, Lord Mount-James, and it is entirely possible that a
      gang of thieves have secured your nephew in order to gain from
      him some information as to your house, your habits, and your
      treasure.”
