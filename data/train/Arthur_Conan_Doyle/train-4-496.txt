‘Nay, that I should never have done!’ cried the young Puritan, who had
listened intently to his elder’s narrative. ‘Would it not have been
more fitting to have raised up your hands and called down vengeance upon
them, as the holy man of old did upon the wicked cities?’ ‘More fitting, quotha!’ said the Mayor impatiently. ‘It is most fitting
that youth should be silent until his opinion is asked on such matters.
God’s wrath comes with leaden feet, but it strikes with iron hands. In
His own good time He has judged when the cup of these men’s iniquities
is overflowing. It is not for us to instruct Him. Curses have, as the
wise man said, a habit of coming home to roost. Bear that in mind,
Master John Derrick, and be not too liberal with them.’
