      “I see that you are professionally rather busy just now,” said
      he, glancing very keenly across at me.       “Yes, I’ve had a busy day,” I answered. “It may seem very foolish
      in your eyes,” I added, “but really I don’t know how you deduced
      it.”       Holmes chuckled to himself.       “I have the advantage of knowing your habits, my dear Watson,”
      said he. “When your round is a short one you walk, and when it is
      a long one you use a hansom. As I perceive that your boots,
      although used, are by no means dirty, I cannot doubt that you are
      at present busy enough to justify the hansom.”
