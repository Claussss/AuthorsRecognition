      My friend had listened with amused surprise to this long speech,
      which was poured forth with extraordinary vigour and earnestness,
      every point being driven home by the slapping of a brawny hand
      upon the speaker’s knee. When our visitor was silent Holmes
      stretched out his hand and took down letter “S” of his
      commonplace book. For once he dug in vain into that mine of
      varied information.
