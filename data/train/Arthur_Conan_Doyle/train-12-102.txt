“I hope, Miss McIntyre,” said Raffles Haw, when they had descended to
the sitting-room once more, “that you will do me the honour of coming to
see the little curiosities which I have gathered together. Your brother
will, I am sure, escort you up; or perhaps Mr. McIntyre would care to
come?” “I shall be delighted to come, Mr. Haw,” cried Laura, with her sweetest
smile. “A good deal of my time just now is taken up in looking after the
poor people, who find the cold weather very trying.” Robert raised his
eyebrows, for it was the first he had heard of his sister's missions of
mercy, but Mr. Raffles Haw nodded approvingly. “Robert was telling us of
your wonderful hot-houses. I am sure I wish I could transport the whole
parish into one of them, and give them a good warm.”
