“Alas! lady, I have now no purpose. I have but two friends in the world,
and they have gone to Christchurch, where it is likely I shall join
them.” “And where is Christchurch?” “At the castle which is held by the brave knight, Sir Nigel Loring,
constable to the Earl of Salisbury.” To his surprise she burst out a-laughing, and, spurring her palfrey,
dashed off down the glade, with her page riding behind her. Not one word
did she say, but as she vanished amid the trees she half turned in her
saddle and waved a last greeting. Long time he stood, half hoping that
she might again come back to him; but the thud of the hoofs had died
away, and there was no sound in all the woods but the gentle rustle and
dropping of the leaves. At last he turned away and made his way back to
the high-road--another person from the light-hearted boy who had left it
a short three hours before.
