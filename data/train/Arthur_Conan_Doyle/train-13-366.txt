      “‘Of course we searched the house from cellar to garret, but
      there was no trace of him. It is, as I have said, a labyrinth of
      an old house, especially the original wing, which is now
      practically uninhabited; but we ransacked every room and cellar
      without discovering the least sign of the missing man. It was
      incredible to me that he could have gone away leaving all his
      property behind him, and yet where could he be? I called in the
      local police, but without success. Rain had fallen on the night
      before and we examined the lawn and the paths all round the
      house, but in vain. Matters were in this state, when a new
      development quite drew our attention away from the original
      mystery.
