A great hush fell over the huge multitude as the two last champions
faced each other. A double issue seemed to rest upon their contest, for
their personal fame was at stake as well as their party's honor. Both
were famous warriors, but as their exploits had been performed in widely
sundered countries, they had never before been able to cross lances. A
course between such men would have been enough in itself to cause the
keenest interest, apart from its being the crisis which would decide who
should be the victors of the day. For a moment they waited--the German
sombre and collected, Sir Nigel quivering in every fibre with
eagerness and fiery resolution. Then, amid a long-drawn breath from
the spectators, the glove fell from the marshal's hand, and the two
steel-clad horsemen met like a thunderclap in front of the royal stand.
The German, though he reeled for an instant before the thrust of the
Englishman, struck his opponent so fairly upon the vizor that the laces
burst, the plumed helmet flew to pieces, and Sir Nigel galloped on down
the lists with his bald head shimmering in the sunshine. A thousand
waving scarves and tossing caps announced that the first bout had fallen
to the popular party.
