ts were well known to a good number of people at
the time, and some version of them did actually appear in a provincial
paper, but was generally discredited. They have now been thrown into
narrative form, the incidents having been collated from the sworn
statements of Colonel Cochrane Cochrane, of the Army and Navy Club,
and from the letters of Miss Adams, of Boston, Mass. These have been
supplemented by the evidence of Captain Archer, of the Egyptian Camel
Corps, as given before the secret Government inquiry at Cairo. Mr. James
Stephens has refused to put his version of the matter into writing,
but as these proofs have been submitted to him, and no correction or
deletion has been made in them, it may be supposed that he has not
succeeded in detecting any grave misstatement of fact, and that any
objection which he may have to their publication depends rather upon
private and personal scruples.
