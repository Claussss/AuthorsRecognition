And now the comrades were journeying upon that old, old road which runs
across the south of England and yet never turns toward London, for the
good reason that the place was a poor hamlet when first the road was
laid. From Winchester, the Saxon capital, to Canterbury, the holy city
of Kent, ran that ancient highway, and on from Canterbury to the narrow
straits where, on a clear day, the farther shore can be seen. Along this
track as far back as history can trace the metals of the west have been
carried and passed the pack-horses which bore the goods which Gaul sent
in exchange. Older than the Christian faith and older than the Romans,
is the old road. North and south are the woods and the marshes, so
that only on the high dry turf of the chalk land could a clear track be
found. The Pilgrim's Way, it still is called; but the pilgrims were the
last who ever trod it, for it was already of immemorial age before the
death of Thomas a Becket gave a new reason why folk should journey to
the scene of his murder.
