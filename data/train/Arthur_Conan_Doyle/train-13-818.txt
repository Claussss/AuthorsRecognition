      “My dear Watson,” he said, “I write these few lines through the
      courtesy of Mr. Moriarty, who awaits my convenience for the final
      discussion of those questions which lie between us. He has been
      giving me a sketch of the methods by which he avoided the English
      police and kept himself informed of our movements. They certainly
      confirm the very high opinion which I had formed of his
      abilities. I am pleased to think that I shall be able to free
      society from any further effects of his presence, though I fear
      that it is at a cost which will give pain to my friends, and
      especially, my dear Watson, to you. I have already explained to
      you, however, that my career had in any case reached its crisis,
      and that no possible conclusion to it could be more congenial to
      me than this. Indeed, if I may make a full confession to you, I
      was quite convinced that the letter from Meiringen was a hoax,
      and I allowed you to depart on that errand under the persuasion
      that some development of this sort would follow. Tell Inspector
      Patterson that the papers which he needs to convict the gang are
      in pigeonhole M., done up in a blue envelope and inscribed
      ‘Moriarty.’ I made every disposition of my property before
      leaving England, and handed it to my brother Mycroft. Pray give
      my greetings to Mrs. Watson, and believe me to be, my dear
      fellow,
