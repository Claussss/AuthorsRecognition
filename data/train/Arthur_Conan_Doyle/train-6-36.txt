face paled for a moment, it is true, but he plucked the crucifix from

grip upon brethren of the holy house of Saint Bernard! Run down to my
chaplain, brother! Bid him bring the exorcist with him, and also the
blessed box of relics, and the bones of Saint James from under the
altar! With these and a contrite and humble heart we may show front to
all the powers of darkness.”
