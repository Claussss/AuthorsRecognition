      “In the immediate neighbourhood, yes. But we have several small
      watering-places not very far away. And the farmers take in
      lodgers.”       “These hieroglyphics have evidently a meaning. If it is a purely
      arbitrary one, it may be impossible for us to solve it. If, on
      the other hand, it is systematic, I have no doubt that we shall
      get to the bottom of it. But this particular sample is so short
      that I can do nothing, and the facts which you have brought me
      are so indefinite that we have no basis for an investigation. I
      would suggest that you return to Norfolk, that you keep a keen
      lookout, and that you take an exact copy of any fresh dancing men
      which may appear. It is a thousand pities that we have not a
      reproduction of those which were done in chalk upon the
      window-sill. Make a discreet inquiry also as to any strangers in
      the neighbourhood. When you have collected some fresh evidence,
      come to me again. That is the best advice which I can give you,
      Mr. Hilton Cubitt. If there are any pressing fresh developments,
      I shall be always ready to run down and see you in your Norfolk
      home.”
