“I remember her well.” “She and I, Alleyne, broke the lucky groat together ere we parted, and
she wears my ring upon her finger. 'Caro mio,' quoth she when last we
parted, 'I shall be near thee in the wars, and thy danger will be my
danger.' Alleyne, as God is my help, as I came up the stairs this night
I saw her stand before me, her face in tears, her hands out as though in
warning--I saw it, Alleyne, even as I see those two archers upon their
couches. Our very finger-tips seemed to meet, ere she thinned away like
a mist in the sunshine.”
