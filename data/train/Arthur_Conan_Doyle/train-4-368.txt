‘Amen! Amen!’ cried as many of the peasants as were within earshot. ‘They have elevated their horn, Master Pettigrue,’ said the
grizzly-haired Puritan. ‘They have set up their candlestick on high--the
candlestick of a perverse ritual and of an idolatrous service. Shall it
not be dashed down by the hands of the righteous?’ ‘Lo, this same candle waxed big and burned sooty, even as an offence to
the nostrils, in the days of our fathers,’ cried a burly red-faced man,
whose dress proclaimed him to be one of the yeoman class. ‘So was it
when Old Noll did get his snuffing shears to work upon it. It is a wick
which can only be trimmed by the sword of the faithful.’ A grim laugh
from the whole party proclaimed their appreciation of the pious waggery
of their companion.
