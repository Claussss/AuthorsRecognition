The Squire had spurred his horse down the hillside and never halted
until he was within a bowshot of the gate. The French prisoner followed
hard behind him, with a buzz of reproaches and expostulations. “You are mad, Nigel!” he cried. “What do you hope to do then? Would you
carry the castle with your own hands? Halt, man, halt, in the name of
the Virgin!” But Nigel had no plan in his head and only obeyed the fevered impulse
to do something to ease his thoughts. He paced his horse up and down,
waving his spear, and shouting insults and challenges to the garrison.
Over the high wall a hundred jeering faces looked down upon him. So
rash and wild was his action that it seemed to those within to mean some
trap, so the drawbridge was still held high and none ventured forth to
seize him. A few long-range arrows pattered on the rocks, and then with
a deep booming sound a huge stone, hurled from a mangonel, sang over the
head of the two Squires and crushed into splinters amongst the boulders
behind them. The Frenchman seized Nigel's bridle and forced him farther
from the gateway.
