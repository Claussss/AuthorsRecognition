      “Halloa!” cried Dr. Mortimer, “what is this?”       A steep curve of heath-clad land, an outlying spur of the moor,
      lay in front of us. On the summit, hard and clear like an
      equestrian statue upon its pedestal, was a mounted soldier, dark
      and stern, his rifle poised ready over his forearm. He was
      watching the road along which we travelled.       “What is this, Perkins?” asked Dr. Mortimer.
