And now came such a ride as still lingers in the gossip of the lowly
country folk and forms the rude jingle of that old Surrey ballad, now
nearly forgotten, save for the refrain:            The Doe that sped on Hinde Head,
              The Kestril on the winde,
           And Nigel on the Yellow Horse
              Can leave the world behinde. Before them lay a rolling ocean of dark heather, knee-deep, swelling in
billow on billow up to the clear-cut hill before them. Above stretched
one unbroken arch of peaceful blue, with a sun which was sinking down
toward the Hampshire hills. Through the deep heather, down the gullies,
over the watercourses, up the broken slopes, Pommers flew, his great
heart bursting with rage, and every fiber quivering at the indignities
which he had endured.
