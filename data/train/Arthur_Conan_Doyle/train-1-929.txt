Upon October 9th, the second anniversary of the Ultimatum, the hands of
the military were strengthened by the proclamation of Cape Town and all
the seaport towns as being in a state of martial law. By this means a
possible source of supplies and recruits for the enemy was effectually
blocked. That it had not been done two years before is a proof of how
far local political considerations can be allowed to over-ride the
essentials of Imperial policy. Meanwhile treason courts were sitting,
and sentences, increasing rapidly from the most trivial to the most
tragic, were teaching the rebel that his danger did not end upon the
field of battle. The execution of Lotter and his lieutenants was a sign
that the patience of a long-suffering Empire had at last reached an end.
