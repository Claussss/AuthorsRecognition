very courtly tongue. I will have him out of his armor, if he blast me!” So saying he sprang once more from his horse and plunging his hand down
the slit in the collapsed gorget he closed it tightly upon a fistful of
Nigel's yellow curls. The groan that came forth was enough to convince
him that it was indeed a man who lurked within. At the same time his
eyes fell upon the hole in the mail corselet which had served the Squire
as a visor, and he burst into deep-chested mirth. The King, the Prince
and Chandos, who had watched the scene from a distance, too much amused
by it to explain or interfere, rode up weary with laughter, now that all
was discovered.
