The colonel rose from his chair laughing.  "The officers of the Guards
want you to buy yourself some little trifle which may add to your
comfort," he said.  "It is not from me, so you need not thank me." He
took up the old man's tobacco pouch and slipped a crisp banknote inside
it. "Thank ye kindly, sir.  But there's one favour that I would like to ask
you, colonel." "Yes, my man." "If I'm called, colonel, you won't grudge me a flag and a firing party?
I'm not a civilian; I'm a guardsman--I'm the last of the old Third
Guards."
