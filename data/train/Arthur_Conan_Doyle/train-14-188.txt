      “Certainly, sir,” said he, “I had the telegram delivered to Mr.
      Barrymore exactly as directed.”       “Who delivered it?”       “My boy here. James, you delivered that telegram to Mr. Barrymore
      at the Hall last week, did you not?”       “Yes, father, I delivered it.”       “Into his own hands?” I asked.       “Well, he was up in the loft at the time, so that I could not put
      it into his own hands, but I gave it into Mrs. Barrymore’s hands,
      and she promised to deliver it at once.”
