      “‘My dear, dear son,—Now that approaching disgrace begins to
      darken the closing years of my life, I can write with all truth
      and honesty that it is not the terror of the law, it is not the
      loss of my position in the county, nor is it my fall in the eyes
      of all who have known me, which cuts me to the heart; but it is
      the thought that you should come to blush for me—you who love me
      and who have seldom, I hope, had reason to do other than respect
      me. But if the blow falls which is forever hanging over me, then
      I should wish you to read this, that you may know straight from
      me how far I have been to blame. On the other hand, if all should
      go well (which may kind God Almighty grant!), then if by any
      chance this paper should be still undestroyed and should fall
      into your hands, I conjure you, by all you hold sacred, by the
      memory of your dear mother, and by the love which had been
      between us, to hurl it into the fire and to never give one
      thought to it again.
