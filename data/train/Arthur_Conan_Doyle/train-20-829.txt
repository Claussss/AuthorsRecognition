      “Who did know of the existence of that letter?”       “No one in the house.”       “Surely your wife knew?”       “No, sir. I had said nothing to my wife until I missed the paper
      this morning.”       The Premier nodded approvingly.       “I have long known, sir, how high is your sense of public duty,”
      said he. “I am convinced that in the case of a secret of this
      importance it would rise superior to the most intimate domestic
      ties.”
