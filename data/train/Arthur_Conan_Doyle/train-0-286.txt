face might have been chiselled out of marble, so hard and set was its
expression, while its eyes glowed with a baleful light. “Where are you going?” “Never mind,” he answered; and, slinging his weapon over his shoulder,

the haunts of the wild beasts. Amongst them all there was none so fierce
and so dangerous as himself.
