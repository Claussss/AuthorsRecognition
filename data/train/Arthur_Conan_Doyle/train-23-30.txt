Mr. Funk, who is a critical student of psychic phenomena, and also the
joint compiler of the standard American dictionary, narrates a story in
point which could be matched from other sources.  He tells of an
American doctor of his acquaintance, and he vouches personally for the
truth of the incident.  This doctor, in the course of a cataleptic
seizure in Florida, was aware that he had left his body, which he saw
lying beside him.  He had none the less preserved his figure and his
identity.  The thought of some friend at a distance came into his mind,
and after an appreciable interval he found himself in that friend's
room, half way across the continent.  He saw his friend, and was
conscious that his friend saw him.  He afterwards returned to his own
room, stood beside his own senseless body, argued within himself
whether he should re-occupy it or not, and finally, duty overcoming
inclination, he merged his two frames together and continued his life.
A letter from him to his friend explaining matters crossed a letter
from the friend, in which he told how he also had been aware of his
presence.  The incident is narrated in detail in Mr. Funk's "Psychic
Riddle."
