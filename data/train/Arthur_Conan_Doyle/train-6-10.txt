But there were few so far-sighted that they could see that here, as
ever, good was coming out of evil. At the moment misery and ruin were
brought into every family. The dead cattle, the ungarnered crops, the
untilled lands--every spring of wealth had dried up at the same moment.
Those who were rich became poor; but those who were poor already, and
especially those who were poor with the burden of gentility upon their
shoulders, found themselves in a perilous state. All through England
the smaller gentry were ruined, for they had no trade save war, and they
drew their living from the work of others. On many a manor-house there
came evil times, and on none more than on the Manor of Tilford, where
for many generations the noble family of the Lorings had held their
home.
