That awfu' cling-clang was aye dingin' in my lugs, and I couldna bear
to be alane in the passages for fear o' hearin' it ance again. I only
wanted a chance or an excuse tae gie the general notice, and tae gang
back to some place where I could see Christian folk, and have the kirk
within a stone-cast tae fa' back upon. But it proved tae be ordained that, instead o' my saying the word, it
should come frae the general himsel'.
