There was a dead silence in the room. It was broken by the chairman. “What is your evidence for this, Brother McMurdo?” he asked. “It is in this letter which has come into my hands,” said McMurdo. He
read the passage aloud. “It is a matter of honour with me that I can
give no further particulars about the letter, nor put it into your
hands; but I assure you that there is nothing else in it which can
affect the interests of the lodge. I put the case before you as it has
reached me.”
