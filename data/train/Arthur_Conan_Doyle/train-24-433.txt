“We cannot tarry,” said Sir Nigel, riding towards the town, with the
mayor upon his left side; “the Prince awaits us at Bordeaux, and we may
not be behind the general muster. Yet I will promise you that on our way
we shall find time to pass Freshwater and to prevail upon these rovers
to leave you in peace.” “We are much beholden to you!” cried the mayor “But I cannot see, my
lord, how, without a war-ship, you may venture against these men. With
your archers, however, you might well hold the town and do them great
scath if they attempt to land.”
