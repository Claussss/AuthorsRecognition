      “Excuse me an instant,” said Holmes. “Were you alone during this
      conversation?”       “Absolutely.”       “In a large room?”       “Thirty feet each way.”       “In the centre?”       “Yes, about it.”       “And speaking low?”       “My uncle’s voice is always remarkably low. I hardly spoke at
      all.”       “Thank you,” said Holmes, shutting his eyes; “pray go on.”       “I did exactly what he indicated, and waited until the other
      clerks had departed. One of them in my room, Charles Gorot, had
      some arrears of work to make up, so I left him there and went out
      to dine. When I returned he was gone. I was anxious to hurry my
      work, for I knew that Joseph—the Mr. Harrison whom you saw just
      now—was in town, and that he would travel down to Woking by the
      eleven o’clock train, and I wanted if possible to catch it.
