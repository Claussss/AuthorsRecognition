      “So it seems to me.”       Holmes gave an enigmatic smile.       “Well,” said he, “let us go round. Not one of your cases,
      Watson—mental, not physical. All right; come if you want to. Now,
      Mr. Soames—at your disposal!”       The sitting-room of our client opened by a long, low, latticed
      window on to the ancient lichen-tinted court of the old college.
      A Gothic arched door led to a worn stone staircase. On the ground
      floor was the tutor’s room. Above were three students, one on
      each story. It was already twilight when we reached the scene of
      our problem. Holmes halted and looked earnestly at the window.
      Then he approached it, and, standing on tiptoe with his neck
      craned, he looked into the room.
