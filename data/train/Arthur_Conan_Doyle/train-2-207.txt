We ascended the stairs and viewed the body. Miss Brenda Tregennis had
been a very beautiful girl, though now verging upon middle age. Her
dark, clear-cut face was handsome, even in death, but there still
lingered upon it something of that convulsion of horror which had been
her last human emotion. From her bedroom we descended to the
sitting-room, where this strange tragedy had actually occurred. The
charred ashes of the overnight fire lay in the grate. On the table were
the four guttered and burned-out candles, with the cards scattered over
its surface. The chairs had been moved back against the walls, but all
else was as it had been the night before. Holmes paced with light,
swift steps about the room; he sat in the various chairs, drawing them
up and reconstructing their positions. He tested how much of the garden
was visible; he examined the floor, the ceiling, and the fireplace; but
never once did I see that sudden brightening of his eyes and tightening
of his lips which would have told me that he saw some gleam of light in
this utter darkness.
