Talking of romance and of chivalry, that tattered book down yonder
has as much between its disreputable covers as most that I know. It
is Washington Irving's "Conquest of Granada." I do not know where
he got his material for this book--from Spanish Chronicles, I
presume--but the wars between the Moors and the Christian knights
must have been among the most chivalrous of exploits. I could not
name a book which gets the beauty and the glamour of it better than
this one, the lance-heads gleaming in the dark defiles, the red bale
fires glowing on the crags, the stern devotion of the mail-clad
Christians, the debonnaire and courtly courage of the dashing
Moslem. Had Washington Irving written nothing else, that book alone
should have forced the door of every library. I love all his books,
for no man wrote fresher English with a purer style; but of them all
it is still "The Conquest of Granada" to which I turn most often.
