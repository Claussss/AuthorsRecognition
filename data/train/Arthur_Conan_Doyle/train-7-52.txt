“Isn't it just too lovely for anything?” cried Sadie, joyously. “I've
got a donkey that runs on casters, and the saddle is just elegant. Did
you ever see anything so cunning as these beads and things round his
neck? You must make a memo, _re_ donkey, Mr. Stephens. Isn't that
correct legal English?” Stephens looked at the pretty, animated, boyish face looking up at
him from under the coquettish straw hat, and he wished that he had the
courage to tell her in her own language that she was just too sweet for
anything. But he feared above all things lest he should offend her,
and so put an end to their present pleasant intimacy. So his compliment
dwindled into a smile.
