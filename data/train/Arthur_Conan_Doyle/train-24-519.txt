“Once more, Sir Oliver,” said Sir Nigel, looking shorewards with
sparkling eyes, “do we find ourselves at the gate of honor, the door
which hath so often led us to all that is knightly and worthy. There
flies the prince's banner, and it would be well that we haste ashore and
pay our obeisance to him. The boats already swarm from the bank.” “There is a goodly hostel near the west gate, which is famed for the
stewing of spiced pullets,” remarked Sir Oliver. “We might take the edge
of our hunger off ere we seek the prince, for though his tables are
gay with damask and silver he is no trencherman himself, and hath no
sympathy for those who are his betters.”
