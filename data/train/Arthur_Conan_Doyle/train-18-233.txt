Every spar and rope and writhing piece of cordage showed up hard and
clear under the vivid light which spluttered and flickered from the
highest portion of the forecastle. Beyond the doomed ship, out of the
great darkness came the long, rolling lines of big waves, never ending,
never tiring, with a petulant tuft of foam here and there upon their
crests. Each as it reached the broad circle of unnatural light appeared
to gather strength and volume and to hurry on more impetuously until
with a roar and a jarring crash it sprang upon its victim.
