Against their dark background one or two livid, sulphur-coloured
splotches showed up malignant and menacing, while the surface of the
sea had changed from the appearance of burnished quicksilver to that of
ground glass. A low, moaning sound rose up from the ocean as if it knew
that trouble was in store for it. Far out in the Channel I saw a single panting, eager steam vessel making
its way to Belfast Lough, and the large barque which I had observed in
the morning still beating about in the offing, endeavouring to pass to
the northward.
