There were monks journeying from one cell to another, Benedictines with
their black gowns looped up to show their white skirts, Carthusians
in white, and pied Cistercians. Friars also of the three wandering
orders--Dominicans in black, Carmelites in white and Franciscans in
gray. There was no love lost between the cloistered monks and the free
friars, each looking on the other as a rival who took from him the
oblations of the faithful; so they passed on the high road as cat passes
dog, with eyes askance and angry faces.
