So it was that McMurdo, the self-confessed fugitive from justice, took
up his abode under the roof of the Shafters, the first step which was
to lead to so long and dark a train of events, ending in a far distant
land. 
Chapter 2--The Bodymaster McMurdo was a man who made his mark quickly. Wherever he was the folk
around soon knew it. Within a week he had become infinitely the most
important person at Shafter's. There were ten or a dozen boarders there;
but they were honest foremen or commonplace clerks from the stores, of a
very different calibre from the young Irishman. Of an evening when they
gathered together his joke was always the readiest, his conversation the
brightest, and his song the best. He was a born boon companion, with a
magnetism which drew good humour from all around him.
