      the sound of her voice.”       “Well,” said I, “you call that love, Mr. Carruthers, but I should
      call it selfishness.”       “Maybe the two things go together. Anyhow, I couldn’t let her go.
      Besides, with this crowd about, it was well that she should have
      someone near to look after her. Then, when the cable came, I knew
      they were bound to make a move.”
