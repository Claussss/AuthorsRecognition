   "Critics kind--never mind!
    Critics flatter--no matter!
    Critics blame--all the same!
    Critics curse--none the worse!
    Do your best-- ---- the rest!" 
I have been talking in the past tense of heroes and of knight-errants,
but surely their day is not yet passed. When the earth has all been
explored, when the last savage has been tamed, when the final cannon
has been scrapped, and the world has settled down into unbroken
virtue and unutterable dulness, men will cast their thoughts back to
our age, and will idealize our romance and--our courage, even as we
do that of our distant forbears. "It is wonderful what these people
did with their rude implements and their limited appliances!" That
is what they will say when they read of our explorations, our
voyages, and our wars.
