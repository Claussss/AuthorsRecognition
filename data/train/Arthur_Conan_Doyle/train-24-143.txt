“Sir Claude Latour and the White Company!” shouted the travellers,
draining off their goblets. “Well quaffed, mes braves! It is for me to fill your cups again, since
you have drained them to my dear lads of the white jerkin. Hola! mon
ange, bring wine and ale. How runs the old stave?--         We'll drink all together
        To the gray goose feather
        And the land where the gray goose flew.”
