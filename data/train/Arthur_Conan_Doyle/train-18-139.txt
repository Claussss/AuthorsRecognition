“And now you have found me, Corporal Smith,” said the tenant of
Cloomber, “what is it that you want of me?” “Why, everything. I want a roof to cover me, and clothes to wear, and
food to eat, and, above all, brandy to drink.” “Well, I'll take you in and do what I can for you,” said the general
slowly. “But look here, Smith, we must have discipline. I'm the general
and you are the corporal; I am the master and you are the man. Now,
don't let me have to remind you of that again.”
