"A smattering.  But his French is good." "Speaking of Arabic, Charles, have you dipped into Averroes?" "No, I have not.  But the appointment would be an excellent one in
every way.  Would you have the great goodness to arrange the matter in
my absence?" "Certainly, Charles, certainly.  Is there anything else that I can do?" "No.  I hope to be in the House by Monday." "I trust so.  We miss you at every turn.  The Times will try to make

irresponsible thing, Charles.  There is no method by which he may be
confuted, however preposterous his assertions.  Good-bye!  Read Porson!
Goodbye!"
