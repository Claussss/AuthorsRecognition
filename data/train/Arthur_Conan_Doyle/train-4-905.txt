‘Her’s been a true mate to me for more’n thirty year,’ said the old man,
the tears coursing down his wrinkled cheeks. ‘Thirty zeed-toimes and
thirty harvests we’ve worked together. But this is a zeed-toime which
shall have a harvest o’ blood if my right hand can compass it.’ ‘If you go to t’ wars, Gaffer Swain, we’ll look to your homestead,’
said the farmer who had spoken before. ‘As to t’ greenstuffs as this
gentleman asks for he shall have not one wainload but three, if he will
but gi’ us half-an-hour to fill them up. If he does not tak them t’
others will, so we had raither that they go to the good cause. Here,
Miles, do you wak the labourers, and zee that they throw the potato
store wi’ the spinach and the dried meats into the waggons wi’ all
speed.’
