They were near enough now to have a good look at the Frenchmen. One was
a big swarthy man with a long black beard. He had a red cap and an ax
over his shoulder. There were ten other hardy-looking fellows, all of
them well armed, and there were three who seemed to be boys. “Shall we try a shaft upon them?” asked Hugh Baddlesmere. “They are well
within our bowshot.” “Only one of you can shoot at a time, for you have no footing,” said
Badding. “With one foot in the prow and one over the thwart you will get
your stance. Do what you may, and then we will close in upon them.”
