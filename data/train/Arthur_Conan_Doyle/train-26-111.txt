And all this didactic talk comes from looking at that old green
cover of Poe. I am sure that if I had to name the few books which
have really influenced my own life I should have to put this one
second only to Macaulay's Essays. I read it young when my mind was
plastic. It stimulated my imagination and set before me a supreme
example of dignity and force in the methods of telling a story.
It is not altogether a healthy influence, perhaps. It turns the
thoughts too forcibly to the morbid and the strange.
