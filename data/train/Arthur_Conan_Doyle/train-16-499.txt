pulsation--but we still persevere, it is our duty." "Shall I bring brandy?" said the landlady. "Yes, and towels, and a hip bath and a basin--but the brandy first." This sentiment met with the hearty approbation of the corpse. "Why, he's drinking it," said the landlady, as she applied the glass to
my lips. "Merely an instance of a reflex automatic action," said Tom. "My good
woman, any corpse will drink brandy if you only apply it to the
glossopharyngeal tract. Stand aside and we will proceed to try Marshall
Hall's method of resuscitation."
