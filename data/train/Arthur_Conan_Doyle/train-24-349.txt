“We can scare hope,” said Nigel, “to have all ready for our start before
the feast of St. Luke, for there is much to be done in the time. You
will have leisure, therefore, if it please you to take service under me,

go; but in sooth he is over young for such rough work as may be before
us.” “And I have one favor to crave from you,” added the lady of the castle,
as Alleyne turned to leave their presence. “You have, as I understand,
much learning which you have acquired at Beaulieu.”
