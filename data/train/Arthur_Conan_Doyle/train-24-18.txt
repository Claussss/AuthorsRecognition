“And the woman?” asked the Abbot. “Did she not break into lamentation
and woe that a brother should so demean himself?” “Nay, she smiled sweetly upon him and thanked him. I can vouch it and so
can brother Porphyry.” “Canst thou?” cried the Abbot, in a high, tempestuous tone. “Canst thou
so? Hast forgotten that the five-and-thirtieth rule of the order is that
in the presence of a woman the face should be ever averted and the eyes
cast down? Hast forgot it, I say? If your eyes were upon your sandals,
how came ye to see this smile of which ye prate? A week in your cells,
false brethren, a week of rye-bread and lentils, with double lauds and
double matins, may help ye to remembrance of the laws under which ye
live.”
