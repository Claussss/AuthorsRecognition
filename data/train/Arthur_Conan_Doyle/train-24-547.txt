Sir Oliver, amid a fresh titter from those who were near enough to catch
his words. “How many have you in your train?” asked the prince, assuming a graver
mien. “I have forty men-at-arms, sire,” said Sir Oliver. “And I have one hundred archers and a score of lancers, but there are
two hundred men who wait for me on this side of the water upon the
borders of Navarre.”
