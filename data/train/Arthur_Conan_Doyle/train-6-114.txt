It was very well for him to threaten to carry the matter before the
King, but it was years since royal Edward had heard the name of Loring,
and Nigel knew that the memory of princes was a short one. Besides, the
Church was the ruling power in the palace as well as in the cottage, and
it was only for very good cause that a King could be expected to cross
the purposes of so high a prelate as the Abbot of Waverley, as long as
they came within the scope of the law. Where then was he to look for
help? With the simple and practical piety of the age, he prayed for the
aid of his own particular saints: of Saint Paul, whose adventures by
land and sea had always endeared him; of Saint George, who had gained
much honorable advancement from the Dragon; and of Saint Thomas, who
was a gentleman of coat-armor, who would understand and help a person of
gentle blood. Then, much comforted by his naive orisons he enjoyed the
sleep of youth and health until the entrance of the lay brother with the
bread and small beer, which served as breakfast, in the morning.
