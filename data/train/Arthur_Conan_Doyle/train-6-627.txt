“Nay, fair sir, it is in my mind that our ship is lighter and faster
than theirs. If the fog hold another hour we should be through them.” “Stand to your arms!” yelled Knolles. “Stand to your arms--! They are on
us!” The Basilisk had indeed been spied from the Spanish Admiral's ship
before the fog closed down. With so light a breeze, and such a fog,
he could not hope to find her under sail. But by an evil chance not a
bowshot from the great Spanish carack was a low galley, thin and swift,
with oars which could speed her against wind or tide. She also had
seen the Basilisk and it was to her that the Spanish leader shouted his
orders. For a few minutes she hunted through the fog, and then sprang
out of it like a lean and stealthy beast upon its prey. It was the sight
of the long dark shadow gliding after them which had brought that wild
shout of alarm from the lips of the English knight. In another instant
the starboard oars of the galley had been shipped, the sides of the two
vessels grated together, and a stream of swarthy, red-capped Spaniards
were swarming up the sides of the Basilisk and dropped with yells of
triumph upon her deck.
