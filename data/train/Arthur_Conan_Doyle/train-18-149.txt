Weel, on the morn I gaed up to the office and there I foond the factor
and a lang, thin, dour man wi' grey hair and a face as brown and
crinkled as a walnut. He looked hard at me wi' a pair o' een that glowed
like twa spunks, and then he says, says he: “You've been born in these pairts, I understan'?” “Aye,” says I, “and never left them neither.” “Never been oot o' Scotland?” he speers. “Twice to Carlisle fair,” says I, for I am a man wha loves the truth;
and besides I kenned that the factor would mind my gaeing there, for I
bargained fur twa steers and a stirk that he wanted for the stockin' o'
the Drumleugh Fairm.
