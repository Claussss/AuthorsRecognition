Glancing round, however, he saw something which was more dangerous to
his plans than the resistance of the enemy. The wind, which had become
more fitful and feebler, now fell suddenly away, until the sails hung
limp and straight above them. A belt of calm lay along the horizon, and
the waves around had smoothed down into a long oily swell on which
the two little vessels rose and fell. The great boom of the Marie Rose
rattled and jarred with every lurch, and the high thin prow pointed
skyward one instant and seaward the next in a way that drew fresh groans
from the unhappy Aylward. In vain Cock Badding pulled on his sheets and
tried hard to husband every little wandering gust which ruffled for an
instant the sleek rollers. The French master was as adroit a sailor, and
his boom swung round also as each breath of wind came up from astern.
