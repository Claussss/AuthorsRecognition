      When the youth had been dispatched with the note, Sherlock Holmes
      gave his instructions to the servants. If any visitor were to
      call asking for Mrs. Hilton Cubitt, no information should be
      given as to her condition, but he was to be shown at once into
      the drawing-room. He impressed these points upon them with the
      utmost earnestness. Finally he led the way into the drawing-room,
      with the remark that the business was now out of our hands, and
      that we must while away the time as best we might until we could
      see what was in store for us. The doctor had departed to his
      patients, and only the inspector and myself remained.
