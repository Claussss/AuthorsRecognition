      as he sank, like a wearied man, into an armchair. “It’s bad
      enough to feel that you are surrounded by unseen, unknown folk,
      who have some kind of design upon you, but when, in addition to
      that, you know that it is just killing your wife by inches, then
      it becomes as much as flesh and blood can endure. She’s wearing
      away under it—just wearing away before my eyes.”
