      The appeal was one which could not be ignored. It was impossible
      to refuse the request of a fellow-countrywoman dying in a strange
      land. Yet I had my scruples about leaving Holmes. It was finally
      agreed, however, that he should retain the young Swiss messenger
      with him as guide and companion while I returned to Meiringen. My
      friend would stay some little time at the fall, he said, and
      would then walk slowly over the hill to Rosenlaui, where I was to
      rejoin him in the evening. As I turned away I saw Holmes, with
      his back against a rock and his arms folded, gazing down at the
      rush of the waters. It was the last that I was ever destined to
      see of him in this world.
