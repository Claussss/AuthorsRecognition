“And how long have you been playing this trick upon us, Mr. Holmes?”
 said the inspector angrily. “How long have you allowed us to waste
ourselves upon a search that you knew to be an absurd one?” “Not one instant, my dear Mr. Mac. Only last night did I form my views
of the case. As they could not be put to the proof until this evening, I
invited you and your colleague to take a holiday for the day. Pray what
more could I do? When I found the suit of clothes in the moat, it at
once became apparent to me that the body we had found could not have
been the body of Mr. John Douglas at all, but must be that of the
bicyclist from Tunbridge Wells. No other conclusion was possible.
Therefore I had to determine where Mr. John Douglas himself could be,
and the balance of probability was that with the connivance of his wife
and his friend he was concealed in a house which had such conveniences
for a fugitive, and awaiting quieter times when he could make his final
escape.”
