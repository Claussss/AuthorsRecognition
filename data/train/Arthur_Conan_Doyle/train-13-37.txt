      “I have the things themselves in the sitting-room, if you would
      care to see them.”       “I should be very glad.” We all filed into the front room and sat
      round the central table while the Inspector unlocked a square tin
      box and laid a small heap of things before us. There was a box of
      vestas, two inches of tallow candle, an A.D.P. briar-root pipe, a
      pouch of seal-skin with half an ounce of long-cut Cavendish, a
      silver watch with a gold chain, five sovereigns in gold, an
      aluminium pencil-case, a few papers, and an ivory-handled knife
      with a very delicate, inflexible blade marked Weiss & Co.,
      London.
