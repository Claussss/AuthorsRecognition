He was followed by the ex-tramp, Corporal Rufus Smith, now well-clad and
prosperous, who limped along beside his master, the two pacing up and
down the lawn absorbed in conversation. I observed that from time to
time one or other of them would pause and glance furtively all about
them, as though guarding keenly against a surprise. I should have
preferred communicating with the general alone, but since there was no
dissociating him from his companion, I beat loudly on the fencing with
my stick to attract their attention. They both faced round in a moment,
and I could see from their gestures that they were disturbed and
alarmed.
