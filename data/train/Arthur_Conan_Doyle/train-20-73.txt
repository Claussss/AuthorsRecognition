      “One moment!” said Holmes. “Who opened the door?”       “A middle-aged woman, who was, I suppose, his housekeeper.”       “And it was she, I presume, who mentioned your name?”       “Exactly,” said McFarlane.       “Pray proceed.”       McFarlane wiped his damp brow, and then continued his narrative:       “I was shown by this woman into a sitting-room, where a frugal
      supper was laid out. Afterwards, Mr. Jonas Oldacre led me into
      his bedroom, in which there stood a heavy safe. This he opened
      and took out a mass of documents, which we went over together. It
      was between eleven and twelve when we finished. He remarked that
      we must not disturb the housekeeper. He showed me out through his
      own French window, which had been open all this time.”
