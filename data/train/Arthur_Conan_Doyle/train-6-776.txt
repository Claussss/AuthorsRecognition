With a shout, twenty picked men rushed forward with the pine-tree under
their arms, the heavy end turned toward the gate. The arbalesters on the
tower leaned over and shot into the midst of them, but could not stop
their advance. Two dropped, but the others raising their shields ran
onward still shouting, crossed the bridge of fagots, and came with a
thundering crash against the door. It splintered from base to arch, but
kept its place.
