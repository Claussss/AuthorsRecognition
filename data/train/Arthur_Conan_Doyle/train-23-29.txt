When a man has taken hashish or certain other drugs, he not
infrequently has the experience that he is standing or floating beside
his own body, which he can see stretched senseless upon the couch.  So
also under anaesthetics, particularly under laughing gas, many people
are conscious of a detachment from their bodies, and of experiences at
a distance.  I have myself seen very clearly my wife and children
inside a cab while I was senseless in the dentist's chair.  Again, when
a man is fainting or dying, and his system in an unstable condition, it
is asserted in very many definite instances that he can, and does,
manifest himself to others at a distance.  These phantasms of the
living, which have been so carefully explored and docketed by Messrs.
Myers and Gurney, ran into hundreds of cases.  Some people claim that
by an effort of will they can, after going to sleep, propel their own
doubles in the direction which they desire, and visit those whom they
wish to see.  Thus there is a great volume of evidence--how great no
man can say who has not spent diligent years in exploring it--which
vouches for the existence of this finer body containing the precious
jewels of the mind and spirit, and leaving only gross confused animal
functions in its heavier companion.
