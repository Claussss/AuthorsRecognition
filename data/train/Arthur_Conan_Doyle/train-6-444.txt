“As you will,” said Aylward, with a clouded brow. “I have been told that
in the late wars many a French prince and baron has not been too proud
to take his death wound from an English yeoman's shaft, and that nobles
of England have been glad enough to stand by and see it done.” Nigel shook his head sadly. “It is sooth you say, archer, and indeed it
is no new thing, for that good knight Richard of the Lion Heart met his
end in such a lowly fashion, and so also did Harold the Saxon. But this
is a private matter, and I would not have you draw your bow against
him. Neither can I ride at him myself, for he is weak in body, though
dangerous in spirit. Therefore, we will go upon our way, since there is
neither profit nor honor to be gained, nor any hope of advancement.”
