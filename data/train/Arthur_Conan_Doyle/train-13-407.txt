      Three days later we were back in Baker Street together; but it
      was evident that my friend would be much the better for a change,
      and the thought of a week of spring time in the country was full
      of attractions to me also. My old friend, Colonel Hayter, who had
      come under my professional care in Afghanistan, had now taken a
      house near Reigate in Surrey, and had frequently asked me to come
      down to him upon a visit. On the last occasion he had remarked
      that if my friend would only come with me he would be glad to
      extend his hospitality to him also. A little diplomacy was
      needed, but when Holmes understood that the establishment was a
      bachelor one, and that he would be allowed the fullest freedom,
      he fell in with my plans and a week after our return from Lyons
      we were under the Colonelâ€™s roof. Hayter was a fine old soldier
      who had seen much of the world, and he soon found, as I had
      expected, that Holmes and he had much in common.
