      “My God!” gasped our client. “Do you tell me that during these
      long ten weeks of agony the stolen papers were within the very
      room with me all the time?”       “So it was.”       “And Joseph! Joseph a villain and a thief!”       “Hum! I am afraid Joseph’s character is a rather deeper and more
      dangerous one than one might judge from his appearance. From what
      I have heard from him this morning, I gather that he has lost
      heavily in dabbling with stocks, and that he is ready to do
      anything on earth to better his fortunes. Being an absolutely
      selfish man, when a chance presented itself he did not allow
      either his sister’s happiness or your reputation to hold his
      hand.”
