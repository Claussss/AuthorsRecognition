      “‘If then your eye goes on to read this line, I know that I shall
      already have been exposed and dragged from my home, or as is more
      likely, for you know that my heart is weak, by lying with my
      tongue sealed forever in death. In either case the time for
      suppression is past, and every word which I tell you is the naked
      truth, and this I swear as I hope for mercy.       “‘My name, dear lad, is not Trevor. I was James Armitage in my
      younger days, and you can understand now the shock that it was to
      me a few weeks ago when your college friend addressed me in words
      which seemed to imply that he had surmised my secret. As Armitage
      it was that I entered a London banking house, and as Armitage I
      was convicted of breaking my country’s laws, and was sentenced to
      transportation. Do not think very harshly of me, laddie. It was a
      debt of honour, so called, which I had to pay, and I used money
      which was not my own to do it, in the certainty that I could
      replace it before there could be any possibility of its being
      missed. But the most dreadful ill-luck pursued me. The money
      which I had reckoned upon never came to hand, and a premature
      examination of accounts exposed my deficit. The case might have
      been dealt leniently with, but the laws were more harshly
      administered thirty years ago than now, and on my twenty-third
      birthday I found myself chained as a felon with thirty-seven
      other convicts in ’tween-decks of the barque _Gloria Scott_,
      bound for Australia.
