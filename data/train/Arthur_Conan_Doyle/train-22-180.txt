“Man, I'll admeet that I had my doubts if there was ever an outsider,”
 said MacDonald, “but that's all past now. We've had the bicycle
identified, and we have a description of our man; so that's a long step
on our journey.” “It sounds to me like the beginning of the end,” said Holmes. “I'm sure
I congratulate you both with all my heart.” “Well, I started from the fact that Mr. Douglas had seemed disturbed
since the day before, when he had been at Tunbridge Wells. It was at
Tunbridge Wells then that he had become conscious of some danger. It was
clear, therefore, that if a man had come over with a bicycle it was
from Tunbridge Wells that he might be expected to have come. We took the
bicycle over with us and showed it at the hotels. It was identified at
once by the manager of the Eagle Commercial as belonging to a man named
Hargrave, who had taken a room there two days before. This bicycle and
a small valise were his whole belongings. He had registered his name
as coming from London, but had given no address. The valise was London
made, and the contents were British; but the man himself was undoubtedly
an American.”
