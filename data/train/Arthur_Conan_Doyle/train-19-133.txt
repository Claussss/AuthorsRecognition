"Yes, I am angry." "But not with me?" "No, no, my darling!  You would not understand." "But you have not told me why you came." "I came to ask you whether you would always love me--no matter what I
did, or what shadow might fall on my name.  Would you believe in me and
trust me however black appearances might be against me?" "You know that I would, Austin." "Yes, I know that you would.  What I do I shall do for you.  I am
driven to it.  There is no other way out, my darling!"  I kissed her
and rushed from the room.
