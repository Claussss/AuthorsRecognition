So he wrote from his sick-room in the Castle of Ploermel late in the
summer, but yet another summer had come before his crushed head had
mended and his wasted limbs had gained their strength once more. With
despair he heard of the breaking of the truce, and of the fight at
Mauron in which Sir Robert Knolles and Sir Walter Bentley crushed the
rising power of Brittany--a fight in which many of the thirty champions
of Josselin met their end. Then, when with renewed strength and high
hopes in his heart he went forth to search for the famous Croquart who
proclaimed himself ever ready night or day to meet any man with any
weapon, it was only to find that in trying the paces of his new horse
the German had been cast into a ditch and had broken his neck. In the
same ditch perished Nigel's last chance of soon accomplishing that deed
which should free him from his vow.
