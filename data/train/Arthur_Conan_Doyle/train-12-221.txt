He led him to a great iron-clamped chest which stood in the corner, and,
throwing it open, he took from it a small case of carved ivory. “Inside this,” he said, “I have left a paper which makes clear anything
which is still hidden from you. Should anything happen to me you
will always be able to inherit my powers, and to continue my plans
by following the directions which are there expressed. And now,”
 he continued, throwing his casket back again into the box, “I shall
frequently require your help, but I do not think it will be necessary
this morning. I have already taken up too much of your time. If you are
going back to Elmdene I wish that you would tell Laura that I shall be
with her in the afternoon.”
