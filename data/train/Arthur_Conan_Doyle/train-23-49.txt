A word should be said as to that fear of fiends and evil spirits which
appears to have so much weight with some of the critics of this
subject.  When one looks more closely at this emotion it seems somewhat
selfish and cowardly.  These creatures are in truth our own backward
brothers, bound for the same ultimate destination as ourselves, but
retarded by causes for which our earth conditions may have been partly
responsible.  Our pity and sympathy should go out to them, and if they
do indeed manifest at a seance, the proper Christian attitude is, as it
seems to me, that we should reason with them and pray for them in order
to help them upon their difficult way.  Those who have treated them in
this way have found a very marked difference in the subsequent
communications.  In Admiral Usborne Moore's "Glimpses of the Next
State" there will be found some records of an American circle which
devoted itself entirely to missionary work of this sort.  There is some
reason to believe that there are forms of imperfect development which
can be helped more by earthly than by purely spiritual influences, for
the reason, perhaps, that they are closer to the material.
