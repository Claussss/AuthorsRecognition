several regiments of horse?’ ‘The word of an officer of the Blues with whom I conversed at
Salisbury,’ Saxon answered. ‘He confided in me, believing me to be one
of the Duke of Beaufort’s household. As to the horse, one party pursued
us on Salisbury Plain with bloodhounds, and another attacked us not
twenty miles from here and lost a score of troopers and a cornet.’
