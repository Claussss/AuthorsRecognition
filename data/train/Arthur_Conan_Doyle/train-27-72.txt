At home things grew worse. To return at half-past five, and find the
children still undressed, screaming, hungry and dirty, was a matter of

'stead o' me; she might 'a' done easy if she liked, bein' sich a fine
gal; but she's good-'arted, is Melier; an' she can't 'elp bein' a bit
thoughtless.' Whereat his sister called him a fool (it was her customary
goodbye at such times), and took herself off.
