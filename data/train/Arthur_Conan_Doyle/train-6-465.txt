Never in his dreams had so perfect a vision come to cheer Nigel's heart,
and as he struggled with his clothes, glancing up continually at this
wondrous traveler, he pattered forth prayers of thanksgiving to the good
Saint Paul who had shown such loving-kindness to his unworthy servant
and thrown him in the path of so excellent and debonair a gentleman. But alas! how often at the last instant the cup is dashed from the lips!
This joyful chance was destined to change suddenly to unexpected and
grotesque disaster--disaster so strange and so complete that through
all his life Nigel flushed crimson when he thought of it. He was busily
stripping his hunting-costume, and with feverish haste he had doffed
boots, hat, hose, doublet and cloak, so that nothing remained save a
pink jupon and pair of silken drawers. At the same time Aylward was
hastily unbuckling the load with the intention of handing his master
his armor piece by piece, when the Squire gave one last challenging peal
from his silver trumpet into the very ear of the spare horse.
