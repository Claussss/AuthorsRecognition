      “‘It was over them that the great quarrel arose. There were many
      of us who were glad enough to win back our freedom, and yet who
      had no wish to have murder on our souls. It was one thing to
      knock the soldiers over with their muskets in their hands, and it
      was another to stand by while men were being killed in cold
      blood. Eight of us, five convicts and three sailors, said that we
      would not see it done. But there was no moving Prendergast and
      those who were with him. Our only chance of safety lay in making
      a clean job of it, said he, and he would not leave a tongue with
      power to wag in a witness-box. It nearly came to our sharing the
      fate of the prisoners, but at last he said that if we wished we
      might take a boat and go. We jumped at the offer, for we were
      already sick of these bloodthirsty doings, and we saw that there
      would be worse before it was done. We were given a suit of
      sailors’ togs each, a barrel of water, two casks, one of junk and
      one of biscuits, and a compass. Prendergast threw us over a
      chart, told us that we were shipwrecked mariners whose ship had
      foundered in lat. 15º N. and long 25º W., and then cut the
      painter and let us go.
