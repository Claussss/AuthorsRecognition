Then of a sudden the Prince raised his hand and gave a cry. Chandos
echoed it, it swelled down the line, and with one mighty chorus of
twanging strings and hissing shafts the long-pent storm broke at last. Alas for the noble steeds! Alas for the gallant men. When the lust of
battle is over who would not grieve to see that noble squadron break
into red ruin before the rain of arrows beating upon the faces and
breasts of the horses? The front rank crashed down, and the others piled
themselves upon the top of them, unable to check their speed, or to
swerve aside from the terrible wall of their shattered comrades which
had so suddenly sprung up before them. Fifteen feet high was that
blood-spurting mound of screaming, kicking horses and writhing,
struggling men. Here and there on the flanks a horseman cleared himself
and dashed for the hedge, only to have his steed slain under him and to
be hurled from his saddle. Of all the three hundred gallant riders, not
one ever reached that fatal hedge.
