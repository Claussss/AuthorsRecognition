'What about the wineglasses?' 'Can you see them in your mind's eye?' 'I see them clearly.' 'We are told that three men drank from them. Does that strike you as
likely?' 'Why not? There was wine in each glass.' 'Exactly, but there was beeswing only in one glass. You must have
noticed that fact. What does that suggest to your mind?' 'The last glass filled would be most likely to contain beeswing.' 'Not at all. The bottle was full of it, and it is inconceivable that the
first two glasses were clear and the third heavily charged with it.
There are two possible explanations, and only two. One is that after the
second glass was filled the bottle was violently agitated, and so the
third glass received the beeswing. That does not appear probable. No,
no, I am sure that I am right.'
