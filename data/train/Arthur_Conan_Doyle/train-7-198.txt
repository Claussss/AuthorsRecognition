between this and mid-day. Hamilton and Hedley of the Camel Corps are
good boys, and they'll be after us like a streak. They'll have no
baggage-camels to hold them back, you can lay your life on that! Little

were telling me all their precautions against a raid, that I should
depend upon them for our lives.”
