The heralds rode round with a warning to the spectators. Then they
halted at the side of the two bands of men who now stood in a long line
facing each other with fifty yards of grass between. The visors had been
closed, and every man was now cased in metal from head to foot, some few
glowing in brass, the greater number shining in steel. Only their fierce
eyes could be seen smoldering in the dark shadow of their helmets. So
for an instant they stood glaring and crouching.
