They were in mid-channel. The white and green coasts of Picardy and of
Kent lay clear upon either side of them. The wide channel stretched in
front, deepening from the light blue beneath their prow to purple on the
far sky-line. Behind them was that thick bank of cloud from which they
had just burst. It lay like a gray wall from east to west, and through
it were breaking the high shadowy forms of the ships of Spain. Four of
them had already emerged, their red bodies, gilded sides and painted
sails shining gloriously in the evening sun. Every instant a fresh
golden spot grew out of the fog, which blazed like a star for an
instant, and then surged forward to show itself as the brazen beak of
the great red vessel which bore it. Looking back, the whole bank of
cloud was broken by the widespread line of noble ships which were
bursting through it. The Basilisk lay a mile or more in front of them
and two miles clear of their wing. Five miles farther off, in the
direction of the French coast, two other small ships were running
down Channel. A cry of joy from Robert Knolles and a hearty prayer
of gratitude to the saints from the old shipman hailed them as their
missing comrades, the cog Thomas and the Grace Dieu.
