Like a grotesque frieze the party moved one by one along the plank
gangway and up the brown crumbling bank. Mr. Stephens led them, a thin,
dry, serious figure, in an English straw hat. His red “Baedeker” gleamed
under his arm, and in one hand he held a little paper of notes, as if it
were a brief. He took Miss Sadie by one arm and her aunt by the other
as they toiled up the bank, and the young girl's laughter rang frank
and clear in the morning air as “Baedeker” came fluttering down at their
feet. Mr. Belmont and Colonel Cochrane followed, the brims of their
sun-hats touching as they discussed the relative advantages of the
Mauser, the Lebel, and the Lee-Metford. Behind them walked Cecil Brown,
listless, cynical, self-contained. The fat clergyman puffed slowly up
the bank, with many gasping witticisms at his own defects. “I'm one of
those men who carry everything before them,” said he, glancing ruefully
at his rotundity, and chuckling wheezily at his own little joke. Last
of all came Headingly, slight and tall, with the student stoop about his
shoulders, and Fardet, the good-natured, fussy, argumentative Parisian.
