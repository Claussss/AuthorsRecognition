Men, as distinct from women, have, both in the higher and lower classes
of life, ceased, in the greater number of cases, to show a living
interest in religion.  The churches lose their grip upon the
people--and lose it rapidly.  Small inner circles, convocations,
committees, assemblies, meet and debate and pass resolutions of an ever
narrower character.  But the people go their way and religion is dead,
save in so far as intellectual culture and good taste can take its
place.  But when religion is dead, materialism becomes active, and what
active materialism may produce has been seen in Germany.
