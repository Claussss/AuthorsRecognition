It was indeed evident, even to the inexperienced eyes of Nigel, that the
Marie Rose was closing in swiftly upon the stranger. She was a heavy,
bluff-bowed, broad-sterned vessel which labored clumsily through the
seas. The swift, fierce little Winchelsea boat swooping and hissing
through the waters behind her was like some keen hawk whizzing down
wind at the back of a flapping heavy-bodied duck. Half an hour before La
Pucelle had been a distant patch of canvas. Now they could see the black
hull, and soon the cut of her sails and the lines of her bulwarks. There
were at least a dozen men upon her deck, and the twinkle of weapons from
amongst them showed that they were preparing to resist. Cock Badding
began to muster his own forces.
