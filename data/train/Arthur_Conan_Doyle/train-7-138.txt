[Illustration: Looking for some landmark p124] Slowly the sun sank towards the west, and their shadows began to trail
along the path where their hearts would go. It was cooler, and a desert
breeze had sprung up, whispering over the rolling, stone-strewed plain.
The Emir at their head had called his lieutenant to his side, and the
pair had peered about, their eyes shaded by their hands, looking for
some landmark. Then, with a satisfied grunt, the chiefs camel had seemed
to break short off at its knees, and then at its hocks, going down in
three curious, broken-jointed jerks until its stomach was stretched upon
the ground. As each succeeding camel reached the spot it lay down also,
until they were all stretched in one long line. The riders sprang off,
and laid out the chopped tibbin upon cloths in front of them, for no
well-bred camel will eat from the ground. In their gentle eyes, their
quiet, leisurely way of eating, and their condescending, mincing manner,
there was something both feminine and genteel, as though a party of prim
old maids had foregathered in the heart of the Libyan desert.
