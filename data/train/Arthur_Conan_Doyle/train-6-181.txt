She went to the old iron coffer, and taking a small key from her girdle
she unlocked it. The rusty hinges, screaming shrilly as she threw back
the lid, proclaimed how seldom it was that she had penetrated into the
sacred recesses of her treasure-chest. At the top were some relics of
old finery: a silken cloak spangled with golden stars, a coif of silver
filigree, a roll of Venetian lace. Beneath were little packets tied in
silk which the old lady handled with tender care: a man's hunting-glove,
a child's shoe, a love-knot done in faded green ribbon, some letters in
rude rough script, and a vernicle of Saint Thomas. Then from the very
bottom of the box she drew three objects, swathed in silken cloth, which
she uncovered and laid upon the table. The one was a bracelet of rough
gold studded with uncut rubies, the second was a gold salver, and the
third was a high goblet of the same metal.
