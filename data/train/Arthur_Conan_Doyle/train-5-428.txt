a cup of tea.  It's so good of you to come in, for I know that your
time is a good deal taken up.  I wanted to say to you that, if I were
you, I should change my rooms at once." Smith sat staring with a lighted match in one hand and his unlit
cigarette in the other. "Yes; it must seem very extraordinary, and the worst of it is that I
cannot give my reasons, for I am under a solemn promise--a very solemn
promise.  But I may go so far as to say that I don't think Bellingham
is a very safe man to live near.  I intend to camp out here as much as
I can for a time."
