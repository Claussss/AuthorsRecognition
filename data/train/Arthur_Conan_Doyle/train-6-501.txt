Cock Badding trod the deck with head erect and jaunty bearing, glancing
up at the swelling sails and then ahead at the little tilted white
triangle, which stood out clear and hard against the bright blue sky.
Behind was the lowland of the Camber marshes, with the bluffs of Rye and
Winchelsea, and the line of cliffs behind them. On the larboard bow rose
the great white walls of Folkestone and of Dover, and far on the distant
sky-line the gray shimmer of those French cliffs for which the fugitives
were making.
