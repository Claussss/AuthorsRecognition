The archers below, enraged at the death of their comrades, leaped and
howled like a pack of ravening wolves. “By Saint Dunstan,” said Percy, looking round at their flushed faces,
“if ever we are to carry it now is the moment, for these men will not be
stopped if hate can take them forward.” “You are right, Thomas!” cried Knolles. “Gather together twenty
men-at-arms each with his shield to cover him. Astley, do you place the
bowmen so that no head may show at window or parapet. Nigel, I pray you
to order the countryfolk forward with their fardels of fagots. Let the
others bring up the lopped pine-tree which lies yonder behind the horse
lines. Ten men-at-arms can bear it on the right, and ten on the left,
having shields over their heads. The gate once down, let every man rush
in. And God help the better cause!”
