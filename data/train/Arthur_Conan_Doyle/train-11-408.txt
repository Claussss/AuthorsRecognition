“What the deuce!” he kept on repeating, “what the deuce!” “Pray do not move,” said I; “I will hurt no one, but woe to the man who
lays hands upon me to stop me. You have nothing to fear if you leave me

base passion. He hated me, this Englishman, because I had been before
him in transfixing the animal. How different are our natures! Had I
seen him do such a deed I would have embraced him with cries of joy. But
there was no time for argument.
