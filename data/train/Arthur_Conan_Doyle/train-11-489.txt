All those thousands of leagues of water had not sufficed to keep Gerard
from the master whom he loved. There he was, there on that cloud-bank yonder over the dark blue sea.

on and on to tell him that he was not forgotten, that after many days
one faithful servant was coming to his side. Every instant the dark blur
upon the water grew harder and clearer.
