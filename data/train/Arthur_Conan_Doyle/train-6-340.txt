Such were the ladies of Cosford toward whom Nigel Loring rode that night
with doublet of Genoan velvet and the new white feather in his cap. He had ridden over Thursley Ridge past that old stone where in days gone
by at the place of Thor the wild Saxons worshiped their war-god. Nigel
looked at it with a wary eye and spurred Pommers onward as he passed it,
for still it was said that wild fires danced round it on the moonless
nights, and they who had ears for such things could hear the scream and
sob of those whose lives had been ripped from them that the fiend might
be honored. Thor's stone, Thor's jumps, Thor's punch-bowl--the whole
country-side was one grim monument to the God of Battles, though the
pious monks had changed his uncouth name for that of the Devil his
father, so that it was the Devil's jumps and the Devil's punch-bowl of
which they spoke. Nigel glanced back at the old gray boulder, and he
felt for an instant a shudder pass through his stout heart. Was it the
chill of the evening air, or was it that some inner voice had whispered
to him of the day when he also might lie bound on such a rock and have
such a blood-stained pagan crew howling around him.
