Now, arguing upon these facts, and they would appear most undoubtedly
to be facts, what possible answer can the materialist or the sceptic
give to the assertion that they are a double proof of the continuity of
personality and the possibility of communication?  Can any reasonable
system of telepathy explain how Miss Cameron discovered the intimate
points characteristic of young Gaylord?  And then, how are we
afterwards, by any possible telepathy, to explain the revelation to
Mrs. Nicol of the identity of her communicant, Fred Bridger, with the
Fred Gaylord who had been written of by Miss Cameron.  The case for
return seems to me a very convincing one, though I contend now, as
ever, that it is not the return of the lost ones which is of such
cogent interest as the message from the beyond which they bear with
them.
