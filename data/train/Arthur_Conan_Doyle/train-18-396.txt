This apparition came rushing out of the cave, and, throwing himself
between the fugitives and our fellows, motioned us back with as
imperious a sweep of the hand as ever an emperor used to his slaves. “Men of blood,” he cried, in a voice of thunder, speaking excellent
English, too--“this is a place for prayer and meditation, not for
murder. Desist, lest the wrath of the gods fall upon you.” “Stand aside, old man,” I shouted. “You will meet with a hurt if you
don't get out of the way.”
