      “Ah, my dear Watson,” said he, striding into the room, “I am very
      delighted to see you! I trust that Mrs. Watson has entirely
      recovered from all the little excitements connected with our
      adventure of the Sign of Four.”       “Thank you, we are both very well,” said I, shaking him warmly by
      the hand.       “And I hope, also,” he continued, sitting down in the
      rocking-chair, “that the cares of medical practice have not
      entirely obliterated the interest which you used to take in our
      little deductive problems.”
