      “This was found between the finger and thumb of the dead man. It
      appears to be a fragment torn from a larger sheet. You will
      observe that the hour mentioned upon it is the very time at which
      the poor fellow met his fate. You see that his murderer might
      have torn the rest of the sheet from him or he might have taken
      this fragment from the murderer. It reads almost as though it
      were an appointment.”
