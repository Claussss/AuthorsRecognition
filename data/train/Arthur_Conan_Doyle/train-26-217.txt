I have said that "Omoo" and "Typee," the books in which the sailor
Melville describes his life among the Otaheitans, have sunk too
rapidly into obscurity. What a charming and interesting task there
is for some critic of catholic tastes and sympathetic judgment
to undertake rescue work among the lost books which would repay
salvage! A small volume setting forth their names and their claims
to attention would be interesting in itself, and more interesting
in the material to which it would serve as an introduction. I am
sure there are many good books, possibly there are some great ones,
which have been swept away for a time in the rush. What chance, for
example, has any book by an unknown author which is published at a
moment of great national excitement, when some public crisis arrests
the popular mind? Hundreds have been still-born in this fashion,
and are there none which should have lived among them? Now, there
is a book, a modern one, and written by a youth under thirty. It
is Snaith's "Broke of Covenden," and it scarce attained a second
edition. I do not say that it is a Classic--I should not like to
be positive that it is not--but I am perfectly sure that the man
who wrote it has the possibility of a Classic within him. Here
is another novel--"Eight Days," by Forrest. You can't buy it. You
are lucky even if you can find it in a library. Yet nothing ever
written will bring the Indian Mutiny home to you as this book
will do. Here's another which I will warrant you never heard of.
It is Powell's "Animal Episodes." No, it is not a collection of
dog-and-cat anecdotes, but it is a series of very singularly told
stories which deal with the animal side of the human, and which you
will feel have an entirely new flavour if you have a discriminating
palate. The book came out ten years ago, and is utterly unknown.
If I can point to three in one small shelf, how many lost lights
must be flitting in the outer darkness!
