“It matters the less since the day is already ours,” said the Prince,
looking over the sea. “My noble father's royal banner flies upon yonder
Spaniard. Mowbray, Audley, Suffolk, Beauchamp, Namur, Tracey, Stafford,
Arundel, each has his flag over a scarlet carack, even as mine floats
over this. See, yonder squadron is already far beyond our reach. But
surely we owe thanks to you who came at so perilous a moment to our aid.
Your face I have seen, and your coat-armor also, young sir, though I
cannot lay my tongue to your name. Let me know that I may thank you.”
