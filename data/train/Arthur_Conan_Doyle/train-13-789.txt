      “The practice is quiet,” said I, “and I have an accommodating
      neighbour. I should be glad to come.”       “And to start to-morrow morning?”       “If necessary.”       “Oh yes, it is most necessary. Then these are your instructions,
      and I beg, my dear Watson, that you will obey them to the letter,
      for you are now playing a double-handed game with me against the
      cleverest rogue and the most powerful syndicate of criminals in
      Europe. Now listen! You will dispatch whatever luggage you intend
      to take by a trusty messenger unaddressed to Victoria to-night.
      In the morning you will send for a hansom, desiring your man to
      take neither the first nor the second which may present itself.
      Into this hansom you will jump, and you will drive to the Strand
      end of the Lowther Arcade, handing the address to the cabman upon
      a slip of paper, with a request that he will not throw it away.
      Have your fare ready, and the instant that your cab stops, dash
      through the Arcade, timing yourself to reach the other side at a
      quarter-past nine. You will find a small brougham waiting close
      to the curb, driven by a fellow with a heavy black cloak tipped
      at the collar with red. Into this you will step, and you will
      reach Victoria in time for the Continental express.”
