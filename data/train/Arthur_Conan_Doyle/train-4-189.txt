‘Wherein,’ said the tall officer, ‘he showed a want of thought towards
me, for had the words been offensive it was for me, who am a senior
captain and brevet-major, to take it up, and not for a slip of a cornet,
who scarce knows enough to put his troop through the exercise.’ ‘You say right, Ogilvy,’ said the other, resuming his seat by the table
and wiping the cards which had been splashed by the wine.’ Had the
comparison been made by an officer of Louis’s guard for the purpose
of contumely and braggadocio, it would then indeed have become us to
venture a passado. But when spoken by an Englishman of ripe experience
it becomes a matter of instructive criticism, which should profit rather
than annoy.’
