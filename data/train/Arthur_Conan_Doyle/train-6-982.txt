But now in a long rolling wave of steel the German battalion roared
swiftly onward. They opened in the center to pass that terrible mound
of death, and then spurred swiftly in upon the archers. They were brave
men, well led, and in their open lines they could avoid the clubbing
together which had been the ruin of the vanguard; yet they perished
singly even as the others had perished together. A few were slain by the
arrows. The greater number had their horses killed under them, and were
so shaken and shattered by the fall that they could not raise their
limbs, over-weighted with iron, from the spot where they lay.
