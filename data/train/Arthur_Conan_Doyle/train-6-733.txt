Englishman who chased me on the great yellow horse. By our Lady of
Rocamadour whose vernicle is round my neck! I could not have believed

I will wager you a hundred crowns, Englishman, that I lead you over a
five-mile course.” “Nay,” said Nigel, “we will wait till you can back a horse ere we talk
of racing it. I am Nigel of Tilford, of the family of Loring, a squire
by rank and the son of a knight. How are you called, young sir?”
