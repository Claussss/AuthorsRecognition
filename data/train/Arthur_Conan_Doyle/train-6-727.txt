Everything fell out even as Knolles had planned. As Nigel rounded the
oak forest, there upon the farther side of it, with only good greensward
between, was the rider upon the white horse. Already he was so near that
Nigel could see him clearly, a young cavalier, proud in his bearing,
clad in purple silk tunic with a red curling feather in his low black
cap. He wore no armor, but his sword gleamed at his side. He rode easily
and carelessly, as one who cares for no man, and his eyes were forever
fixed upon the English soldiers on the road. So intent was he upon them
that he gave no thought to his own safety, and it was only when the low
thunder of the great horse's hoofs broke upon his ears that he turned in
his saddle, looked very coolly and steadily at Nigel, then gave his own
bridle a shake and darted off, swift as a hawk, toward the hills upon
the left.
