"Easy and steady," said the colonel, as he led him to his armchair. "Thank ye, sir; I was near gone that time.  But, Lordy I why, I can
scarce believe it.  To think of me the corporal of the flank company
and you the colonel of the battalion!  How things come round, to be
sure!" "Why, we are very proud of you in London," said the colonel.  "And so
you are actually one of the men who held Hougoumont."  He looked at the
bony, trembling hands, with their huge, knotted knuckles, the stringy
throat, and the heaving, rounded shoulders.  Could this, indeed, be the
last of that band of heroes?  Then he glanced at the half-filled
phials, the blue liniment bottles, the long-spouted kettle, and the
sordid details of the sick room.  "Better, surely, had he died under
the blazing rafters of the Belgian farmhouse," thought the colonel.
