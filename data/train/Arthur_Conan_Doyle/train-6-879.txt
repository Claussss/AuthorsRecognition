their antagonists, for those fluttering pennons and brilliant surcoats
carried a language which all men could read. In front was the banner of
Beaumanoir, blue with silver frets. His motto “J'ayme qui m'ayme” was
carried on a second flag by a little page. “Whose is the shield behind him--silver with scarlet drops?” asked
Knolles.
