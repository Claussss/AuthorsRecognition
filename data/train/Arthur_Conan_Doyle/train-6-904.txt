Beaumanoir, his head giddy with fatigue, opened his helmet and gazed in
despair at this terrible, unbreakable circle. Only too clearly he could
see the inevitable result. His men were wearing themselves out. Already
many of them could scarce stir hand or foot, and might be dead for any
aid which they could give him in winning the fight. Soon all would be in
the same plight. Then these cursed English would break their circle to
swarm over his helpless men and to strike them down. Do what he might,
he could see no way by which such an end might be prevented. He cast his
eyes round in his agony, and there was one of his Bretons slinking away
to the side of the lists. He could scarce credit his senses when he
saw by the scarlet and silver that the deserter was his own well-tried
squire, William of Montaubon.
