      My poor friendâ€™s face had suddenly assumed the most dreadful
      expression. His eyes rolled upwards, his features writhed in
      agony, and with a suppressed groan he dropped on his face upon
      the ground. Horrified at the suddenness and severity of the
      attack, we carried him into the kitchen, where he lay back in a
      large chair, and breathed heavily for some minutes. Finally, with
      a shamefaced apology for his weakness, he rose once more.
