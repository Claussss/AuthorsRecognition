“And so should I, father,” she answered, with spirit; “but Jefferson
will soon be here.” “Yes. It will not be long before he comes. The sooner the better, for we
do not know what their next move may be.” It was, indeed, high time that someone capable of giving advice and
help should come to the aid of the sturdy old farmer and his adopted

minor errors were punished so sternly, what would be the fate of this
arch rebel. Ferrier knew that his wealth and position would be of no
avail to him. Others as well known and as rich as himself had been
spirited away before now, and their goods given over to the Church. He
was a brave man, but he trembled at the vague, shadowy terrors which
hung over him. Any known danger he could face with a firm lip, but
this suspense was unnerving. He concealed his fears from his daughter,
however, and affected to make light of the whole matter, though she,
with the keen eye of love, saw plainly that he was ill at ease.
