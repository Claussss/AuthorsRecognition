"We were talking about nerve just now," observes the surgeon.  "Just
after my qualifying I served in the Navy for a time, as I think you
know.  I was on the flag-ship on the West African Station, and I
remember a singular example of nerve which came to my notice at that
time.  One of our small gunboats had gone up the Calabar river, and
while there the surgeon died of coast fever.  On the same day a man's
leg was broken by a spar falling upon it, and it became quite obvious
that it must be taken off above the knee if his life was to be saved.
The young lieutenant who was in charge of the craft searched among the
dead doctor's effects and laid his hands upon some chloroform, a
hip-joint knife, and a volume of Grey's Anatomy.  He had the man laid
by the steward upon the cabin table, and with a picture of a cross
section of the thigh in front of him he began to take off the limb.
Every now and then, referring to the diagram, he would say:  'Stand by
with the lashings, steward.  There's blood on the chart about here.'
Then he would jab with his knife until he cut the artery, and he and
his assistant would tie it up before they went any further.  In this
way they gradually whittled the leg off, and upon my word they made a
very excellent job of it.  The man is hopping about the Portsmouth Hard
at this day.
