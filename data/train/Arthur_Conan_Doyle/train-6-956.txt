“The same thought was in my own mind, sire,” said Arnold d'Andreghen the
veteran Marshal. “At Crecy the bravest had to turn their backs, for what
can a man do with a horse which is mad with pain and fear? If we advance
upon foot we are our own masters, and if we stop the shame is ours.” “The counsel is good,” said the Duke of Athens, turning his shrewd
wizened face to the King; “but one thing only I would add to it. The
strength of these people lies in their archers, and if we could throw
them into disorder, were it only for a short time, we should win the
hedge; else they will shoot so strongly that we must lose many men
before we reach it, for indeed we have learned that no armor will keep
out their shafts when they are close.”
