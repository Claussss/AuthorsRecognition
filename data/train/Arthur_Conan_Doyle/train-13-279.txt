      “It is customary at Mawson’s for the clerks to leave at midday on
      Saturday. Sergeant Tuson, of the City Police, was somewhat
      surprised, therefore to see a gentleman with a carpet bag come
      down the steps at twenty minutes past one. His suspicions being
      aroused, the sergeant followed the man, and with the aid of
      Constable Pollock succeeded, after a most desperate resistance,
      in arresting him. It was at once clear that a daring and gigantic
      robbery had been committed. Nearly a hundred thousand pounds’
      worth of American railway bonds, with a large amount of scrip in
      other mines and companies, was discovered in the bag. On
      examining the premises the body of the unfortunate watchman was
      found doubled up and thrust into the largest of the safes, where
      it would not have been discovered until Monday morning had it not
      been for the prompt action of Sergeant Tuson. The man’s skull had
      been shattered by a blow from a poker delivered from behind.
      There could be no doubt that Beddington had obtained entrance by
      pretending that he had left something behind him, and having
      murdered the watchman, rapidly rifled the large safe, and then
      made off with his booty. His brother, who usually works with him,
      has not appeared in this job as far as can at present be
      ascertained, although the police are making energetic inquiries
      as to his whereabouts.”
