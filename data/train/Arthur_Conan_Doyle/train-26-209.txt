Another book which shows the romance and the heroism which still
linger upon earth is that large copy of the "Voyage of the Discovery
in the Antarctic" by Captain Scott. Written in plain sailor fashion
with no attempt at over-statement or colour, it none the less (or
perhaps all the more) leaves a deep impression upon the mind. As one
reads it, and reflects on what one reads, one seems to get a clear
view of just those qualities which make the best kind of Briton.
Every nation produces brave men. Every nation has men of energy. But
there is a certain type which mixes its bravery and its energy with
a gentle modesty and a boyish good-humour, and it is just this
type which is the highest. Here the whole expedition seem to have
been imbued with the spirit of their commander. No flinching, no
grumbling, every discomfort taken as a jest, no thought of self,
each working only for the success of the enterprise. When you have
read of such privations so endured and so chronicled, it makes one
ashamed to show emotion over the small annoyances of daily life.
Read of Scott's blinded, scurvy-struck party staggering on to their
goal, and then complain, if you can, of the heat of a northern sun,
or the dust of a country road.
