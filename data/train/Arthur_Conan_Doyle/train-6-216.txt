“I trust that we are better soldiers than jailers,” said Aylward, as he
climbed on his pony. But Nigel's frown relaxed into a smile. “At least we have gained back
what we lost,” said he. “Here I place it on the pommel of my saddle, and
I shall not take my eyes from it until we are safe in Guildford town.” So they jogged on together until passing Saint Catherine's shrine they
crossed the winding Wey once more, and so found themselves in the steep
high street with its heavy-caved gabled houses, its monkish hospitium
upon the left, where good ale may still be quaffed, and its great
square-keeped castle upon the right, no gray and grim skeleton of ruin,
but very quick and alert, with blazoned banner flying free, and steel
caps twinkling from the battlement. A row of booths extended from the
castle gate to the high street, and two doors from the Church of the
Trinity was that of Thorold the goldsmith, a rich burgess and Mayor of
the town.
