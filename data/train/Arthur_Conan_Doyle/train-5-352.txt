A MEDICAL DOCUMENT. Medical men are, as a class, very much too busy to take stock of
singular situations or dramatic events.  Thus it happens that the
ablest chronicler of their experiences in our literature was a lawyer.
A life spent in watching over death-beds--or over birth-beds which are
infinitely more trying--takes something from a man's sense of
proportion, as constant strong waters might corrupt his palate.  The
overstimulated nerve ceases to respond.  Ask the surgeon for his best
experiences and he may reply that he has seen little that is
remarkable, or break away into the technical.  But catch him some night
when the fire has spurted up and his pipe is reeking, with a few of his
brother practitioners for company and an artful question or allusion to
set him going.  Then you will get some raw, green facts new plucked
from the tree of life.
