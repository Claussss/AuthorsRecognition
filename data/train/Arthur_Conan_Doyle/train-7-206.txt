“How long will this be?” “No one can say.” “Well, Cochrane, it's all in our favour. The longer the chase the better
chance for the fresh camels!” and for the hundredth time he looked
back at the long, hard skyline behind them. There was the great, empty,
dun-coloured desert, but where the glint of steel or the twinkle of
white helmet for which he yearned? And soon they cleared the obstacle in their front. It spindled away into
nothing, as a streak of dust would which has been blown across an empty
room. It was curious to see that when it was so narrow that one could
almost jump it, the Arabs would still go for many hundreds of yards
rather than risk the crossing. Then, with good, hard country before them
once more, the tired beasts were whipped up, and they ambled on with a
double-jointed jog-trot, which set the prisoners nodding and bowing in
grotesque and ludicrous misery. It was fun at first, and they smiled
at each other, but soon the fun had become tragedy as the terrible
camel-ache seized them by spine and waist, with its deep, dull throb,
which rises gradually to a splitting agony.
