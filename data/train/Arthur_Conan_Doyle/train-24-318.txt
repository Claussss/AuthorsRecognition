“Art so set on plunder then? Is the purse so light that there is not
enough for a rouse? I have a bag at my belt, camarade, and you have but
to put your fist into it for what you want. It was ever share and share
between us.” “Nay, friend, it is not the Frenchman's gold, but the Frenchman's blood
that I would have. I should not rest quiet in the grave, coz, if I had
not another turn at them. For with us in France it has ever been fair
and honest war--a shut fist for the man, but a bended knee for the
woman. But how was it at Winchelsea when their galleys came down upon it
some few years back? I had an old mother there, lad, who had come down
thither from the Midlands to be the nearer her son. They found her
afterwards by her own hearthstone, thrust through by a Frenchman's bill.
My second sister, my brother's wife, and her two children, they were but
ash-heaps in the smoking ruins of their house. I will not say that we
have not wrought great scath upon France, but women and children have
been safe from us. And so, old friend, my heart is hot within me, and I
long to hear the old battle-cry again, and, by God's truth! if Sir
Nigel unfurls his pennon, here is one who will be right glad to feel the
saddle-flaps under his knees.”
