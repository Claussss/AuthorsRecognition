      “‘Tell me everything, then,’ said I.       “‘I cannot, Jack, I cannot,’ she cried.       “‘Until you tell me who it is that has been living in that
      cottage, and who it is to whom you have given that photograph,
      there can never be any confidence between us,’ said I, and
      breaking away from her, I left the house. That was yesterday, Mr.
      Holmes, and I have not seen her since, nor do I know anything
      more about this strange business. It is the first shadow that has
      come between us, and it has so shaken me that I do not know what
      I should do for the best. Suddenly this morning it occurred to me
      that you were the man to advise me, so I have hurried to you now,
      and I place myself unreservedly in your hands. If there is any
      point which I have not made clear, pray question me about it.
      But, above all, tell me quickly what I am to do, for this misery
      is more than I can bear.”
