“The clothes are commonplace,” remarked Holmes, “save only the overcoat,
which is full of suggestive touches.” He held it tenderly towards the
light. “Here, as you perceive, is the inner pocket prolonged into the
lining in such fashion as to give ample space for the truncated fowling
piece. The tailor's tab is on the neck--'Neal, Outfitter, Vermissa,
U.S.A.' I have spent an instructive afternoon in the rector's library,
and have enlarged my knowledge by adding the fact that Vermissa is a
flourishing little town at the head of one of the best known coal and
iron valleys in the United States. I have some recollection, Mr. Barker,
that you associated the coal districts with Mr. Douglas's first wife,
and it would surely not be too far-fetched an inference that the V.V.
upon the card by the dead body might stand for Vermissa Valley, or that
this very valley which sends forth emissaries of murder may be that
Valley of Fear of which we have heard. So much is fairly clear. And
now, Mr. Barker, I seem to be standing rather in the way of your
explanation.”
