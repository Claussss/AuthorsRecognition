"We had a difference upon a point of professional etiquette," said Dr.
James, and it was all the explanation he would vouchsafe. For two long months Dr. Ripley was brought in contact with his rival
every day, and he learned many things which he had not known before.
She was a charming companion, as well as a most assiduous doctor.  Her
short presence during the long, weary day was like a flower in a sand
waste.  What interested him was precisely what interested her, and she
could meet him at every point upon equal terms.  And yet under all her
learning and her firmness ran a sweet, womanly nature, peeping out in
her talk, shining in her greenish eyes, showing itself in a thousand
subtle ways which the dullest of men could read.  And he, though a bit
of a prig and a pedant, was by no means dull, and had honesty enough to
confess when he was in the wrong.
