quite six years since Douglas left California. You followed him next
year, did you not?” “That is so.” “And he had been married five years. You must have returned about the
time of his marriage.” “About a month before. I was his best man.” “Did you know Mrs. Douglas before her marriage?” “No, I did not. I had been away from England for ten years.”
