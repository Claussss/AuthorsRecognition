      “Underneath is written in a hand so shaky as to be hardly
      legible, ‘Beddoes writes in cipher to say H. has told all. Sweet
      Lord, have mercy on our souls!’       “That was the narrative which I read that night to young Trevor,
      and I think, Watson, that under the circumstances it was a
      dramatic one. The good fellow was heartbroken at it, and went out
      to the Terai tea planting, where I hear that he is doing well. As
      to the sailor and Beddoes, neither of them was ever heard of
      again after that day on which the letter of warning was written.
      They both disappeared utterly and completely. No complaint had
      been lodged with the police, so that Beddoes had mistaken a
      threat for a deed. Hudson had been seen lurking about, and it was
      believed by the police that he had done away with Beddoes and had
      fled. For myself I believe that the truth was exactly the
      opposite. I think that it is most probable that Beddoes, pushed
      to desperation and believing himself to have been already
      betrayed, had revenged himself upon Hudson, and had fled from the
      country with as much money as he could lay his hands on. Those
      are the facts of the case, Doctor, and if they are of any use to
      your collection, I am sure that they are very heartily at your
      service.”
