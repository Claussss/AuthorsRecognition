This is wonderful enough, but far more fantastic is what has still to
be told.  The most marked property of this ectoplasm, very fully
illustrated in the photographs, is that it sets or curdles into the
shapes of human members--of fingers, of hands, of faces, which are at
first quite sketchy and rudimentary, but rapidly coalesce and develop
until they are undistinguishable from those of living beings.  Is not
this the very strangest and most inexplicable thing that has ever yet
been observed by human eyes?  These faces or limbs are usually the size
of life, but they frequently are quite miniatures.  Occasionally they
begin by being miniatures, and grow into full size.  On their first
appearance in the ectoplasm the limb is only on one plane of matter, a
mere flat appearance, which rapidly rounds itself off, until it has
assumed all three planes and is complete.  It may be a mere simulacrum,
like a wax hand, or it may be endowed with full power of grasping
another hand, with every articulation in perfect working order.
