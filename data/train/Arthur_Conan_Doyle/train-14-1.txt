      “Well, Watson, what do you make of it?”       Holmes was sitting with his back to me, and I had given him no
      sign of my occupation.       “How did you know what I was doing? I believe you have eyes in
      the back of your head.”       “I have, at least, a well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot in
      front of me,” said he. “But, tell me, Watson, what do you make of
      our visitor’s stick? Since we have been so unfortunate as to miss
      him and have no notion of his errand, this accidental souvenir
      becomes of importance. Let me hear you reconstruct the man by an
      examination of it.”
