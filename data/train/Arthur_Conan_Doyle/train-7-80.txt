It was a view which, when once seen, must always haunt the mind. Such an
expanse of savage and unrelieved desert might be part of some cold and
burned-out planet rather than of this fertile and bountiful earth. Away
and away it stretched to die into a soft, violet haze in the extremest
distance. In the foreground the sand was of a bright golden yellow,
which was quite dazzling in the sunshine. Here and there in a scattered
cordon stood the six trusty negro soldiers leaning motionless upon their
rifles, and each throwing a shadow which looked as solid as himself. But
beyond this golden plain lay a low line of those black slag-heaps,
with yellow sand-valleys winding between them. These in their turn were
topped by higher and more fantastic hills, and these by others, peeping
over each other's shoulders until they blended with that distant violet
haze. None of these hills were of any height,--a few hundred feet at the
most,--but their savage, saw-toothed crests and their steep scarps of
sun-baked stone gave them a fierce character of their own.
