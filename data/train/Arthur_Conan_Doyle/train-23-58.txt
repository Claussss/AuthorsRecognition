Before leaving this section of the subject, I should say a few more
words upon the evidence as it affects the etheric body.  This body is a
perfect thing.  This is a matter of consequence in these days when so
many of our heroes have been mutilated in the wars.  One cannot
mutilate the etheric body, and it remains always intact.  The first
words uttered by a returning spirit in the recent experience of Dr.
Abraham Wallace were "I have got my left arm again."  The same applies
to all birth marks, deformities, blindness, and other imperfections.
None of them are permanent, and all will vanish in that happier life
that awaits us.  Such is the teaching from the beyond--that a perfect
body waits for each.
