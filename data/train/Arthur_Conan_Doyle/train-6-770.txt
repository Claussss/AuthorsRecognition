but at least their deaths were speedily avenged. The man was in the act of pushing off the second prisoner when an arrow
crashed through his head, and he fell stone dead upon the parapet. But
even in falling he had given the fatal thrust and a second russet figure
swung beside the first against the dark background of the castle wall.
