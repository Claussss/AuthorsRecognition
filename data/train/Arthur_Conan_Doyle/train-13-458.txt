      “Before going into this, I would draw your attention to the fact
      that, if Alec Cunningham’s narrative was correct, and if the
      assailant, after shooting William Kirwan, had _instantly_ fled,
      then it obviously could not be he who tore the paper from the
      dead man’s hand. But if it was not he, it must have been Alec
      Cunningham himself, for by the time that the old man had
      descended several servants were upon the scene. The point is a
      simple one, but the Inspector had overlooked it because he had
      started with the supposition that these county magnates had had
      nothing to do with the matter. Now, I make a point of never
      having any prejudices, and of following docilely wherever fact
      may lead me, and so, in the very first stage of the
      investigation, I found myself looking a little askance at the
      part which had been played by Mr. Alec Cunningham.
