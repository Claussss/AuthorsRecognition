What the German soldier said was so clearly the truth that even the
fanatics were silenced. Away in the east the long shimmering lines
of steel, and the patches of scarlet upon the green hillside, were
arguments which the most thoughtless could not overlook. ‘What would you advise, then?’ asked Monmouth moodily, tapping his
jewelled riding-whip against his high boots. ‘To cross the river and come to hand-grips with them ere they can
get help from the town,’ the burly German answered bluntly. ‘I cannot
understand what we are here for if it be not to fight. If we win, the
town must fall. If we lose, We have had a bold stroke for it, and can do
no more.’
