Pratt-Haldane was most amiable, and listened with all politeness to my
story.  But when I looked at his heavy set features, his slow eyes, and
the ponderous study furniture which surrounded him, I could hardly tell
him what I had come to say.  It was all so substantial, so material.
And, besides, what would I myself have said a short month ago if one of
my colleagues had come to me with a story of demonic possession?
Perhaps.  I should have been less patient than he was.  As it was, he
took notes of my statement, asked me how much tea I drank, how many
hours I slept, whether I had been overworking much, had I had sudden
pains in the head, evil dreams, singing in the ears, flashes before the
eyes--all questions which pointed to his belief that brain congestion
was at the bottom of my trouble.  Finally he dismissed me with a great
many platitudes about open-air exercise, and avoidance of nervous
excitement.  His prescription, which was for chloral and bromide, I
rolled up and threw into the gutter.
