      “But when one gets old one has a longing for home. For years I’ve
      been dreaming of the bright green fields and the hedges of
      England. At last I determined to see them before I died. I saved
      enough to bring me across, and then I came here where the
      soldiers are, for I know their ways and how to amuse them and so
      earn enough to keep me.”       “Your narrative is most interesting,” said Sherlock Holmes. “I
      have already heard of your meeting with Mrs. Barclay, and your
      mutual recognition. You then, as I understand, followed her home
      and saw through the window an altercation between her husband and
      her, in which she doubtless cast his conduct to you in his teeth.
      Your own feelings overcame you, and you ran across the lawn and
      broke in upon them.”
