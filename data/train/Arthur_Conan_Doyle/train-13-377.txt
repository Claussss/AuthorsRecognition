      â€œIt was perfectly obvious to me, on reading the Ritual, that the
      measurements must refer to some spot to which the rest of the
      document alluded, and that if we could find that spot, we should
      be in a fair way towards finding what the secret was which the
      old Musgraves had thought it necessary to embalm in so curious a
      fashion. There were two guides given us to start with, an oak and
      an elm. As to the oak there could be no question at all. Right in
      front of the house, upon the left-hand side of the drive, there
      stood a patriarch among oaks, one of the most magnificent trees
      that I have ever seen.
