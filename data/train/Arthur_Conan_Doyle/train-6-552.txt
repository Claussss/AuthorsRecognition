“In truth my heart was sore for you, Nigel; for you have missed such
a night as comes seldom in any man's life. All went even as we had
planned. The postern gate was opened, and a party made their way in; but
we awaited them, and all were taken or slain. But the greater part of
the French had remained without upon the plain of Nieullet, so we
took horse and went out against them. When we drew near them they were
surprised, but they made good cheer among themselves, calling out to
each other: 'If we fly we lose all. It is better to fight on, in the
hopes that the day may be ours.' This was heard by our people in the
van, who cried out to them: 'By Saint George! you speak truth. Evil
befall him who thinks of flying!' So they held their ground like worthy
people for the space of an hour, and there were many there whom it is
always good to meet: Sir Geoffrey himself, and Sir Pepin de Werre, with
Sir John de Landas, old Ballieul of the Yellow Tooth, and his brother
Hector the Leopard. But above all Sir Eustace de Ribeaumont was at great
pains to meet us worthily, and he was at handstrokes with the King for a
long time. Then, when we had slain or taken them, all the prisoners were
brought to a feast which was ready for them, and the knights of England
waited upon them at the table and made good cheer with them. And all
this, Nigel, we owe to you.”
