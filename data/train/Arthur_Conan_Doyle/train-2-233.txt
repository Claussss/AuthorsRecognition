“None whatever.” “But the cause remains as obscure as before. Come into the arbour here
and let us discuss it together. That villainous stuff seems still to
linger round my throat. I think we must admit that all the evidence
points to this man, Mortimer Tregennis, having been the criminal in the
first tragedy, though he was the victim in the second one. We must
remember, in the first place, that there is some story of a family
quarrel, followed by a reconciliation. How bitter that quarrel may have
been, or how hollow the reconciliation we cannot tell. When I think of
Mortimer Tregennis, with the foxy face and the small shrewd, beady eyes
behind the spectacles, he is not a man whom I should judge to be of a
particularly forgiving disposition. Well, in the next place, you will
remember that this idea of someone moving in the garden, which took our
attention for a moment from the real cause of the tragedy, emanated
from him. He had a motive in misleading us. Finally, if he did not
throw the substance into the fire at the moment of leaving the room,
who did do so? The affair happened immediately after his departure. Had
anyone else come in, the family would certainly have risen from the
table. Besides, in peaceful Cornwall, visitors did not arrive after ten
o’clock at night. We may take it, then, that all the evidence points to
Mortimer Tregennis as the culprit.”
