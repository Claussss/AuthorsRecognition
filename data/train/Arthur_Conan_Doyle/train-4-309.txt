Chapter XIII. Of Sir Gervas Jerome, Knight Banneret of the County of
Surrey The inn was very full of company, being occupied not only by many
Government agents and couriers on their way to and from the seat of
the rising, but also by all the local gossips, who gathered there to
exchange news and consume Dame Hobson the landladyâ€™s home-brewed. In
spite, however, of this stress of custom and the consequent uproar, the
hostess conducted us into her own private room, where we could consume
her excellent cheer in peace and quietness. This favour was due, I
think, to a little sly manoeuvring and a few whispered words from Saxon,
who amongst other accomplishments which he had picked up during his
chequered career had a pleasing knack of establishing friendly relations
with the fair sex, irrespective of age, size, or character. Gentle
and simple, Church and Dissent, Whig and Tory, if they did but wear a
petticoat our comrade never failed, in spite of his fifty years, to make
his way into their good graces by the help of his voluble tongue mid
assured manner.
