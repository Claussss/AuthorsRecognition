      “My dear Mr. Grant Munro—” began Holmes.       Our visitor sprang from his chair. “What!” he cried, “you know my
      name?”       “If you wish to preserve your _incognito_,” said Holmes, smiling,
      “I would suggest that you cease to write your name upon the
      lining of your hat, or else that you turn the crown towards the
      person whom you are addressing. I was about to say that my friend
      and I have listened to a good many strange secrets in this room,
      and that we have had the good fortune to bring peace to many
      troubled souls. I trust that we may do as much for you. Might I
      beg you, as time may prove to be of importance, to furnish me
      with the facts of your case without further delay?”
