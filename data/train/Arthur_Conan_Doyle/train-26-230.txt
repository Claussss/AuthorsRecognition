The essay must always be a somewhat repellent form of literature,
unless it be handled with the lightest and deftest touch. It is too
reminiscent of the school themes of our boyhood--to put a heading
and then to show what you can get under it. Even Stevenson, for whom
I have the most profound admiration, finds it difficult to carry the
reader through a series of such papers, adorned with his original
thought and quaint turn of phrase. Yet his "Men and Books" and
"Virginibus Puerisque" are high examples of what may be done in
spite of the inherent unavoidable difficulty of the task.
