“What I did,” said Alleyne, “was too small a thing for thanks; and yet,
if I may say it without offence, it was too grave and near a matter
for mirth and raillery. I had counted on my brother's love, but God has
willed that it should be otherwise. It is a joy to me to see you again,
lady, and to know that you have reached home in safety, if this be
indeed your home.” “Yes, in sooth, Castle Twynham is my home, and Sir Nigel Loring my
father. I should have told you so this morning, but you said that you
were coming thither, so I bethought me that I might hold it back as
a surprise to you. Oh dear, but it was brave to see you!” she cried,
bursting out a-laughing once more, and standing with her hand pressed to
her side, and her half-closed eyes twinkling with amusement. “You drew
back and came forward with your eyes upon my book there, like the mouse
who sniffs the cheese and yet dreads the trap.”
