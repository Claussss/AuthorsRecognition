Out of the door of the house there stepped a tall, flaxen-haired man,
such a figure as one would choose for the flank of a Grenadier company.
As he turned his brown face and his blue eyes toward us I recognised
Lord Dacre. With long strides he came down the gravel path straight for the spot
where we lay. “Come out, Ned!” he shouted; “you'll have the game-keeper putting a
charge of shot into you. Come out, man, and don't skulk behind the
bushes.”
