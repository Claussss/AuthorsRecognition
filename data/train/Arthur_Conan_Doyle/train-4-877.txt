‘Hooker hath orders to proceed to a certain farm,’ I answered. ‘This we

he. ‘Rat me, if I dare look my musqueteers in the face again unless I
bring them something to toast upon the end of their ramrods! They had

something to attract him. He might see sword-playing at Hockley, or
cocking at Shoe Lane, or baiting at Southwark, or shooting at Tothill

down the river with the ebb tide to the cherry orchards at Rotherhithe,
or drive to Islington to drink the cream, or, above all, walk in the
Park, which is most modish for a gentleman who dresses in the fashion.

to draw us, Dorset Gardens, Lincoln’s Inn, Drury Lane, and the
Queen’s--among the four there was ever some amusement to be found.’
