"And now I come to the amazing part of my tale.  When I woke it was
broad daylight.  I glanced at my watch, and the time was nearly nine.
I had particularly asked to be called at eight, so I was very much
astonished at this forgetfulness.  I sprang up and rang for the
servant.  There was no response.  I rang again and again, with the same
result.  Then I came to the conclusion that the bell was out of order.
I huddled on my clothes and hurried downstairs in an exceedingly bad
temper to order some hot water.  You can imagine my surprise when I
found that there was no one there.  I shouted in the hall.  There was
no answer.  Then I ran from room to room. All were deserted.  My host
had shown me which was his bedroom the night before, so I knocked at
the door. No reply.  I turned the handle and walked in.  The room was
empty, and the bed had never been slept in.  He had gone with the rest.
The foreign host, the foreign footman, the foreign cook, all had
vanished in the night!  That was the end of my visit to Wisteria Lodge."
