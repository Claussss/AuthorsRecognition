But this time there was no hasty flight, no rapturous pursuit to the
wall. The little man braced himself straight, flung up his metal-headed
whip, and met the horse with a crashing blow upon the head, repeated
again and again with every attack. In vain the horse reared and tried
to overthrow its enemy with swooping shoulders and pawing hoofs. Cool,
swift and alert, the man sprang swiftly aside from under the very shadow
of death, and then again came the swish and thud of the unerring blow
from the heavy handle.
