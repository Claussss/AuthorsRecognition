      “Why should he not go to the home of his fathers?”       “It seems natural, does it not? And yet, consider that every
      Baskerville who goes there meets with an evil fate. I feel sure

      race, and the heir to great wealth, to that deadly place. And yet
      it cannot be denied that the prosperity of the whole poor, bleak
      countryside depends upon his presence. All the good work which
      has been done by Sir Charles will crash to the ground if there is
      no tenant of the Hall. I fear lest I should be swayed too much by
      my own obvious interest in the matter, and that is why I bring
      the case before you and ask for your advice.”
