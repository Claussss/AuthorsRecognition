that you are not more conversant with Sanscrit. When I was your age, I
could converse not only in that noble language, but also in the Tamulic,
Lohitic, Gangelic, Taic, and Malaic dialects, which are all offshoots
from the Turanian branch.” “I regret extremely, sir,” I answered, “that I have not inherited your
wonderful talents as a polyglot.”
