CHAPTER X. OF THE LETTER WHICH CAME FROM THE HALL Having thrown this side-light upon my narrative, I can now resume the
statement of my own personal experiences. These I had brought down, as
the reader will doubtless remember, to the date of the arrival of the
savage-looking wanderer who called himself Corporal Rufus Smith. This
incident occurred about the beginning of the month of October, and I
find upon a comparison of dates that Dr. Easterling's visit to Cloomber
preceded it by three weeks or more.
