He was dressed in a brown velveteen coat, loose, dark trousers, with a
shirt that was cut low in the collar, so as to show the muscular,
brown neck, and he still wore the red fez which I had noticed the night
before. I observed with a feeling of surprise, as we approached him, that none
of these garments showed the slightest indication of the rough treatment
and wetting which they must have received during their wearer's
submersion and struggle to the shore.
