A thick wood lay two hundred paces from the road upon which the archers
stood. A stretch of smooth grassy sward lay between. The two peasants
were led out fifty yards from the road, with their faces toward the
wood. There they stood, held on a leash, and casting many a wondering
frightened glance over their shoulders at the preparations which were
being made behind them. Old Bartholomew and the big Yorkshireman had stepped out of the ranks
and stood side by side each with his strung bow in his left hand and a
single arrow in his right. With care they had drawn on and greased their
shooting-gloves and fastened their bracers. They plucked and cast up a
few blades of grass to measure the wind, examined every small point of
their tackle, turned their sides to the mark, and widened their feet
in a firmer stance. From all sides came chaff and counsel from their
comrades.
