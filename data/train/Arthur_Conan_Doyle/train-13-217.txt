IV. The Stockbroker’s Clerk       Shortly after my marriage I had bought a connection in the
      Paddington district. Old Mr. Farquhar, from whom I purchased it,
      had at one time an excellent general practice; but his age, and
      an affliction of the nature of St. Vitus’s dance from which he
      suffered, had very much thinned it. The public not unnaturally
      goes on the principle that he who would heal others must himself
      be whole, and looks askance at the curative powers of the man
      whose own case is beyond the reach of his drugs. Thus as my
      predecessor weakened his practice declined, until when I
      purchased it from him it had sunk from twelve hundred to little
      more than three hundred a year. I had confidence, however, in my
      own youth and energy, and was convinced that in a very few years
      the concern would be as flourishing as ever.
