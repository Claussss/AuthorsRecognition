These questions were absolutely unanswerable, and yet the solemn words
and the terrible gravity which I had seen in the faces of both the
old soldiers forbade me from thinking that their fears were entirely
unfounded. It was all a puzzle--an absolutely insoluble puzzle. One thing at least was clear to me--and that was that in the present
state of my knowledge, and after the general's distinct prohibition,
it was impossible for me to interfere in any way. I could only wait and
pray that, whatever the danger might be, it might pass over, or at least
that my dear Gabriel and her brother might be protected against it.
