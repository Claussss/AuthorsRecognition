      “See the value of imagination,” said Holmes. “It is the one
      quality which Gregory lacks. We imagined what might have
      happened, acted upon the supposition, and find ourselves
      justified. Let us proceed.”       We crossed the marshy bottom and passed over a quarter of a mile
      of dry, hard turf. Again the ground sloped, and again we came on
      the tracks. Then we lost them for half a mile, but only to pick
      them up once more quite close to Mapleton. It was Holmes who saw
      them first, and he stood pointing with a look of triumph upon his
      face. A man’s track was visible beside the horse’s.
