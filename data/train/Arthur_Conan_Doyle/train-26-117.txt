Or is it that our subliminal ego, to use the jargon of the new
psychology, or our astral, in the terms of the new theology, can
learn and convey to the mind that which our own known senses are
unable to apprehend? But that is too long a side track for us to
turn down it. When Maupassant chose he could run Poe close in that domain of the
strange and weird which the American had made so entirely his own.
Have you read Maupassant's story called "Le Horla"? That is as good
a bit of diablerie as you could wish for. And the Frenchman has,
of course, far the broader range. He has a keen sense of humour,
breaking out beyond all decorum in some of his stories, but giving
a pleasant sub-flavour to all of them. And yet, when all is said,
who can doubt that the austere and dreadful American is far the
greater and more original mind of the two?
