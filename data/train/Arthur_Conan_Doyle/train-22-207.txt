“Well, gentlemen,” said my friend gravely, “I am asking you now to
put everything to the test with me, and you will judge for yourselves
whether the observations I have made justify the conclusions to which
I have come. It is a chill evening, and I do not know how long our
expedition may last; so I beg that you will wear your warmest coats.
It is of the first importance that we should be in our places before it
grows dark; so with your permission we shall get started at once.”
