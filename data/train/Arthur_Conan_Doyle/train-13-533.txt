      “I am compelled, to begin with, to say something of my own
      college career. I am a London University man, you know, and I am
      sure that you will not think that I am unduly singing my own
      praises if I say that my student career was considered by my
      professors to be a very promising one. After I had graduated I
      continued to devote myself to research, occupying a minor
      position in King’s College Hospital, and I was fortunate enough
      to excite considerable interest by my research into the pathology
      of catalepsy, and finally to win the Bruce Pinkerton prize and
      medal by the monograph on nervous lesions to which your friend
      has just alluded. I should not go too far if I were to say that
      there was a general impression at that time that a distinguished
      career lay before me.
