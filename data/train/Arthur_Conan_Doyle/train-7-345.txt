There was a lantern upon the table, and he sat down beside it. The
yellow light shone upon his heavy cheek and the red edges of his book.
The strong, steady voice rose above the wash of the water. â€œ'Let them give thanks whom the Lord hath redeemed and delivered from
the hand of the enemy, and gathered them out of the lands, from the
east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south. They went
astray in the wilderness out of the way, and found no city to dwell in.
Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them. So they cried unto the
Lord in their trouble, and He delivered them from their distress. He led
them forth by the right way, that they might go to the city where they
dwelt. Oh that men would therefore praise the Lord for His goodness, and
declare the wonders that He doeth for the children of men.'
