      “There was one thing in the case which had made the deepest
      impression both upon the servants and the police. This was the
      contortion of the Colonel’s face. It had set, according to their
      account, into the most dreadful expression of fear and horror
      which a human countenance is capable of assuming. More than one
      person fainted at the mere sight of him, so terrible was the
      effect. It was quite certain that he had foreseen his fate, and
      that it had caused him the utmost horror. This, of course, fitted
      in well enough with the police theory, if the Colonel could have
      seen his wife making a murderous attack upon him. Nor was the
      fact of the wound being on the back of his head a fatal objection
      to this, as he might have turned to avoid the blow. No
      information could be got from the lady herself, who was
      temporarily insane from an acute attack of brain-fever.
