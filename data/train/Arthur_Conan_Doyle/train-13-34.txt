      “And nothing to connect this man Simpson with the interests of
      the Mapleton stables?”       “Nothing at all.”       Holmes leaned back in the carriage, and the conversation ceased.
      A few minutes later our driver pulled up at a neat little
      red-brick villa with overhanging eaves which stood by the road.
      Some distance off, across a paddock, lay a long grey-tiled
      out-building. In every other direction the low curves of the
      moor, bronze-coloured from the fading ferns, stretched away to
      the sky-line, broken only by the steeples of Tavistock, and by a
      cluster of houses away to the westward which marked the Mapleton
      stables. We all sprang out with the exception of Holmes, who
      continued to lean back with his eyes fixed upon the sky in front
      of him, entirely absorbed in his own thoughts. It was only when I
      touched his arm that he roused himself with a violent start and
      stepped out of the carriage.
