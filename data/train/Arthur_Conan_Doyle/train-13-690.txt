      Percy Phelps and his nurse looked at Holmes during this
      demonstration with surprise and a good deal of disappointment
      written upon their faces. He had fallen into a reverie, with the
      moss-rose between his fingers. It had lasted some minutes before
      the young lady broke in upon it.       “Do you see any prospect of solving this mystery, Mr. Holmes?”
      she asked, with a touch of asperity in her voice.
