      run to nothing. But, indeed, I have little doubt that we can

      it is nearly nine, and the landlady babbled of green peas at
      seven-thirty. What with your eternal tobacco, Watson, and your
      irregularity at meals, I expect that you will get notice to quit,
      and that I shall share your downfall—not, however, before we have
      solved the problem of the nervous tutor, the careless servant,
      and the three enterprising students.”
