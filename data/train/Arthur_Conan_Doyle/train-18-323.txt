“Not that I know of,” my father answered, raising his white eyebrows
in surprise. “You appear to be in an inquisitive humour this
afternoon--what is the object of all these questions? Have our Eastern
neighbours aroused your curiosity or suspicion in any way?” I parried the question as best I might, for I was unwilling to let the
old man know what was in my mind. No good purpose could come from his
enlightenment; his age and his health demanded rest rather than anxiety;
and indeed, with the best will in the world I should have found it
difficult to explain to another what was so very obscure to myself. For
every reason I felt that it was best that he should be kept in the dark.
