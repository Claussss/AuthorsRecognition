The Anglo-Celtic race has always run to individualism, and yet there
is none which is capable of conceiving and carrying out a finer
ideal of discipline. There is nothing in Roman or Grecian annals,
not even the lava-baked sentry at Pompeii, which gives a more
sternly fine object-lesson in duty than the young recruits of the
British army who went down in their ranks on the Birkenhead. And
this expedition of Greely's gave rise to another example which seems
to me hardly less remarkable. You may remember, if you have read the
book, that even when there were only about eight unfortunates still
left, hardly able to move for weakness and hunger, the seven took
the odd man out upon the ice, and shot him dead for breach of
discipline. The whole grim proceeding was carried out with as much
method and signing of papers, as if they were all within sight of
the Capitol at Washington. His offence had consisted, so far as
I can remember, of stealing and eating the thong which bound two
portions of the sledge together, something about as appetizing as a
bootlace. It is only fair to the commander to say, however, that it
was one of a series of petty thefts, and that the thong of a sledge
might mean life or death to the whole party.
