        We'll drink all together
        To the gray goose feather
          And the land where the gray goose flew. “Ha, by my hilt!” shouted Aylward, “it is the dear old bow song of the
Company. Here come two hundred as tight lads as ever twirled a shaft
over their thumbnails. Hark to the dogs, how lustily they sing!” Nearer and clearer, swelling up out of the night, came the gay marching
lilt:         What of the bow?
           The bow was made in England.
        Of true wood, of yew wood,
           The wood of English bows;
        For men who are free
        Love the old yew-tree
           And the land where the yew tree grows.
