‘Nay, I won’t come in with you, Micah,’ said he; ‘there’s mischief
likely to come of all this. My father may grumble over his beer jugs,
but he’s a Churchman and a Tantivy for all that. I’d best keep out of
it.’ ‘You are right,’ I answered. ‘There is no need for you to meddle in the
business. Be mum as to all that you have heard.’ ‘Mum as a mouse,’ said he, and pressing my hand turned away into the
darkness. When I returned to the sitting-room I found that my mother had
hurried into the kitchen, where the crackling of sticks showed that she
was busy in building a fire. Decimus Saxon was seated at the edge of
the iron-bound oak chest at the side of my father, and was watching him
keenly with his little twinkling eyes, while the old man was fixing
his horn glasses and breaking the seals of the packet which his strange
visitor had just handed to him.
