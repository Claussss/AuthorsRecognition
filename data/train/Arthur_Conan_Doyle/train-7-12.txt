“I'm relying on you, Mr. Stephens, to tell me all about Abousir,” said
Miss Sadie Adams. “I do like to know what I am looking at right there at
the time, and not six hours afterwards in my state-room. I haven't got
Abou-Simbel and the wall pictures straight in my mind yet, though I saw
them yesterday.” “I never hope to keep up with it,” said her aunt. “When I am safe back
in Commonwealth Avenue, and there's no dragoman to hustle me around,
I'll have time to read about it all, and then I expect I shall begin
to enthuse and want to come right back again. But it's just too good of
you, Mr. Stephens, to try and keep us informed.”
