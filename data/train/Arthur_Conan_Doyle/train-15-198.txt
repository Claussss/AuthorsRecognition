"It was now evening, and it was decided that the two caravans should
camp together--an arrangement which was the more welcome as we were by
no means sure that we had seen the last of the marauders. I had invited
the leader of the Arabs to have supper with me, and after a long
exercise of prayer with his followers, he came to join me, but my
attempt at hospitality was thrown away, for he would not touch the
excellent wine which I had unpacked for him, nor would he eat any of my
dainties, contenting himself with stale bread, dried dates, and water.
After this meal we sat alone by the smouldering fire, the magnificent
arch of the heavens above us of that deep, rich blue with those
gleaming, clear-cut stars which can only be seen in that dry desert air.
Our camp lay before us, and no sound reached our ears save the dull
murmur of the voices of our companions and the occasional shrill cry of
a jackal among the sandhills around us. Face to face I sat with this
strange man, the glow of the fire beating upon his eager and imperious
features and reflecting from his passionate eyes. It was the strangest
vigil, and one which will never pass from my recollection. I have spoken
with many wise and famous men upon my travels, but never with one who
left the impression of this one.
