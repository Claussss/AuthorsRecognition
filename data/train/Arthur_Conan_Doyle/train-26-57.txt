No smallest estimate of his character is fair which does not
make due allowance for the terrible experiences of his youth and
early middle age. His spirit was as scarred as his face. He was
fifty-three when the pension was given him, and up to then his
existence had been spent in one constant struggle for the first
necessities of life, for the daily meal and the nightly bed. He had
seen his comrades of letters die of actual privation. From childhood
he had known no happiness. The half blind gawky youth, with dirty
linen and twitching limbs, had always, whether in the streets of
Lichfield, the quadrangle of Pembroke, or the coffee-houses of
London, been an object of mingled pity and amusement. With a proud
and sensitive soul, every day of his life must have brought some
bitter humiliation. Such an experience must either break a man's
spirit or embitter it, and here, no doubt, was the secret of that
roughness, that carelessness for the sensibilities of others, which
caused Boswell's father to christen him "Ursa Major." If his nature
was in any way warped, it must be admitted that terrific forces had
gone to the rending of it. His good was innate, his evil the result
of a dreadful experience.
