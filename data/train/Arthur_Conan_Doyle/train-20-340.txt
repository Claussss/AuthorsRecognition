      “Thank you,” said Holmes. “We’ll have some food first. Then you
      can bring round the bicycle.”       “I haven’t got a bicycle.”       Holmes held up a sovereign.       “I tell you, man, that I haven’t got one. I’ll let you have two
      horses as far as the Hall.”       “Well, well,” said Holmes, “we’ll talk about it when we’ve had
      something to eat.”       When we were left alone in the stone-flagged kitchen, it was
      astonishing how rapidly that sprained ankle recovered. It was
      nearly nightfall, and we had eaten nothing since early morning,
      so that we spent some time over our meal. Holmes was lost in
      thought, and once or twice he walked over to the window and
      stared earnestly out. It opened on to a squalid courtyard. In the
      far corner was a smithy, where a grimy lad was at work. On the
      other side were the stables. Holmes had sat down again after one
      of these excursions, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair
      with a loud exclamation.
