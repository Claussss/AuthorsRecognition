Another speculation which is, perhaps, rather more fruitful is upon
what principle did Christ select his twelve chief followers.  Out of
all the multitudes he chose twelve men.  Why these particular ones?  It
was not for their intelligence or learning, for Peter and John, who
were among the most prominent, are expressly described as "unlearned
and ignorant men."  It was not for their virtue, for one of them proved
to be a great villain, and all of them deserted their Master in His
need.  It was not for their belief, for there were great numbers of
believers.  And yet it is clear that they were chosen on some principle
of selection since they were called in ones and in twos.  In at least
two cases they were pairs of brothers, as though some family gift or
peculiarity, might underlie the choice.
