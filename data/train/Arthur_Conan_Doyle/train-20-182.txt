      A flower-bed extended up to the study window, and we all broke
      into an exclamation as we approached it. The flowers were
      trampled down, and the soft soil was imprinted all over with
      footmarks. Large, masculine feet they were, with peculiarly long,
      sharp toes. Holmes hunted about among the grass and leaves like a
      retriever after a wounded bird. Then, with a cry of satisfaction,
      he bent forward and picked up a little brazen cylinder.
