XVIII. HOW BLACK SIMON CLAIMED FORFEIT FROM THE KING OF SARK 
For a day and a half the small fleet made good progress, but on the
second morning, after sighting Cape de la Hague, there came a brisk land
wind which blew them out to sea. It grew into a squall with rain and fog
so that they were two more days beating back. Next morning they found
themselves in a dangerous rock studded sea with a small island upon
their starboard quarter. It was girdled with high granite cliffs of
a reddish hue, and slopes of bright green grassland lay above them. A
second smaller island lay beside it. Dennis the shipman shook his head
as he looked.
