  "As we close it, the club-room is before us, and the table
  on which stand the omelet for Nugent, and the lemons for
  Johnson. There are assembled those heads which live for ever
  on the canvas of Reynolds. There are the spectacles of Burke,
  and the tall thin form of Langton, the courtly sneer of
  Beauclerk and the beaming smile of Garrick, Gibbon tapping
  his snuff-box, and Sir Joshua with his trumpet in his ear.
  In the foreground is that strange figure which is as familiar
  to us as the figures of those among whom we have been brought
  up--the gigantic body, the huge massy face, seamed with the
  scars of disease, the brown coat, the black worsted stockings,
  the grey wig with the scorched foretop, the dirty hands, the
  nails bitten and pared to the quick. We see the eyes and mouth
  moving with convulsive twitches; we see the heavy form rolling;
  we hear it puffing, and then comes the 'Why, sir!' and the
  'What then, sir?' and the 'No, sir!' and the 'You don't see
  your way through the question, sir!'"
