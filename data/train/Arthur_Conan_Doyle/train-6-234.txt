So much had long been patent to the world, but only of recent years had
he shown other and more formidable characteristics: a restless ambition
which coveted his neighbor's throne, and a wise foresight in matters
of commerce, which engaged him now in transplanting Flemish weavers and
sowing the seeds of what for many years was the staple trade of England.
Each of these varied qualities might have been read upon his face. The
brow, shaded by a crimson cap of maintenance, was broad and lofty. The
large brown eyes were ardent and bold. His chin was clean-shaven, and
the close-cropped dark mustache did not conceal the strong mouth, firm,
proud and kindly, but capable of setting tight in merciless ferocity.
His complexion was tanned to copper by a life spent in field sports or
in war, and he rode his magnificent black horse carelessly and easily,
as one who has grown up in the saddle. His own color was black also, for
his active; sinewy figure was set off by close-fitting velvet of that
hue, broken only by a belt of gold, and by a golden border of open pods
of the broom-plant.
