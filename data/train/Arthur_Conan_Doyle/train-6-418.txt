At the summit of the rise Nigel reined in Pommers and looked back at the
little village behind him. There was the old dark manor house, with one
bent figure leaning upon a stick and gazing dimly after him from beside
the door. He looked at the high-pitched roof, the timbered walls, the
long trail of swirling blue smoke which rose from the single chimney,
and the group of downcast old servants who lingered at the gate, John
the cook, Weathercote the minstrel, and Red Swire the broken soldier.
Over the river amid the trees he could see the grim, gray tower of
Waverley, and even as he looked, the iron bell, which had so often
seemed to be the hoarse threatening cry of an enemy, clanged out its
call to prayer. Nigel doffed his velvet cap and prayed also--prayed that
peace might remain at home, and good warfare, in which honor and fame
should await him, might still be found abroad. Then, waving his hand
to the people, he turned his horse's head and rode slowly eastward. A
moment later Aylward broke from the group of archers and laughing girls
who clung to his bridle and his stirrup straps, and rode on, blowing
kisses over his shoulder. So at last the two comrades, gentle and
simple, were fairly started on their venture.
