‘Then, young sir, we shall accept your loyal and gallant offer,’ said
Monmouth. ‘Are ye all agreed, gentlemen, upon the point?’ A murmur of
assent rose from the company. ‘You shall draw up the paper, Wade. Offer him money, a seniority amongst
the dukes, the perpetual Presidentship of Wales--what you will, if you
can but shake him. If not, sequestration, exile, and everlasting infamy.
And, hark ye! you can enclose a copy of the papers drawn up by Van
Brunow, which prove the marriage of my mother, together with the
attestations of the witnesses. Have them ready by to-morrow at daybreak,
when the messenger may start.’ (Note H, Appendix.)
