No word of Pollock. An elephant battery came up from the Punjab, looking in very good
condition. There were several convalescents with it going up to rejoin
their regiments. Knew none of them except Mostyn of the Hussars and
young Blakesley, who was my fag at Charterhouse, and whom I have never
seen since. Punch and cigars _al fresco_ up to eleven o'clock. Letters to-day from Wills & Co. about their little bill forwarded on
from Delhi. Thought a campaign freed a man from these annoyances. Wills
says in his note that, since his written applications have been in
vain, he must call upon me in person. If he calls upon me now he will
assuredly be the boldest and most persevering of tailors.
