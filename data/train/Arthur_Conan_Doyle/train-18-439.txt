“You have been there, then?” I asked. “Been there!” he cried. “What would I be doin' at the Hole o' Cree? No,
I've never been there, nor any other man in his senses.” “How do you know about it, then?” “My great-grandfeyther had been there, and that's how I ken,” Fullarton
answered. “He was fou' one Saturday nicht and he went for a bet. He
didna like tae talk aboot it afterwards, and he wouldna tell a' what
befell him, but he was aye feared o' the very name. He's the first
Fullarton that's been at the Hole o' Cree, and he'll be the last for
me. If ye'll tak' my advice ye'll just gie the matter up and gang hame
again, for there's na guid tae be got oot o' this place.”
