In fighting the Gauls, or the Germans, you are against brave men,
animated by the love of their country. This passion acts more, however,
upon some than others, so that the whole army is not equally inflamed by
it. These Jews, however, besides their love of country, which is very
strong, have a desperate religious fervour, which gives them a fury in
battle such as none of us have ever seen. They throw themselves with a
shriek of joy upon our swords and lances, as if death were all that they
desired.
