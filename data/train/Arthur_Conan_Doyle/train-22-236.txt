struck the limit. I have not moved it since the day I was married, and
it would have taken a file to get it off. I don't know, anyhow, that I
should have cared to part with it; but if I had wanted to I couldn't.
So we just had to leave that detail to take care of itself. On the other

myself at this instant. You slipped up there, Mr. Holmes, clever as
you are; for if you had chanced to take off that plaster you would have
found no cut underneath it.
