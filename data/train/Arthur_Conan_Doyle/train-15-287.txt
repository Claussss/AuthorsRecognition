There was a great fight at the temple, and it was rumoured that it would
be carried by storm to-night, so I went out on to the rising ground
whence one sees the city best. I wonder, uncle, if in your many
campaigns you have ever smelt the smell of a large beleaguered town. The
wind was south to-night, and this terrible smell of death came straight
to our nostrils. There were half a million people there, and every form
of disease, starvation, decomposition, filth and horror, all pent in
within a narrow compass. You know how the lion sheds smell behind the
Circus Maximus, acid and foul. It is like that, but there is a low,
deadly, subtle odour which lies beneath it and makes your very heart
sink within you. Such was the smell which came up from the city
to-night.
