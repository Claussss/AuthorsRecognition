      The interview left Sherlock Holmes very thoughtful, and several
      times in the next few days I saw him take his slip of paper from
      his notebook and look long and earnestly at the curious figures
      inscribed upon it. He made no allusion to the affair, however,
      until one afternoon a fortnight or so later. I was going out when
      he called me back.       “You had better stay here, Watson.”
