‘Your strong opinions, friend,’ said Sir Gervas quietly, ‘are borne out
doubtless by your full knowledge of the subject. How often, prythee,
have you been in these playhouses which you are so ready to decry?’ ‘I thank the Lord that I have never been so far tempted from the
straight path as to set foot within one,’ the Puritan answered, ‘nor
have I ever been in that great sewer which is called London. I trust,
however, that I with others of the faithful may find our way thither
with our tucks at our sides ere this business is finished, when we shall
not be content, I’ll warrant, with shutting these homes of vice, as
Cromwell did, but we shall not leave one stone upon another, and shall
sow the spot with salt, that it may be a hissing and a byword amongst
the people.’
