      A stone-flagged passage, with the kitchens branching away from
      it, led by a wooden staircase directly to the first floor of the
      house. It came out upon the landing opposite to a second more
      ornamental stair which came up from the front hall. Out of this
      landing opened the drawing-room and several bedrooms, including
      those of Mr. Cunningham and his son. Holmes walked slowly, taking
      keen note of the architecture of the house. I could tell from his
      expression that he was on a hot scent, and yet I could not in the
      least imagine in what direction his inferences were leading him.
