      It was a very long street of two-story brick houses, neat and
      prim, with whitened stone steps and little groups of aproned
      women gossiping at the doors. Halfway down, Lestrade stopped and
      tapped at a door, which was opened by a small servant girl. Miss
      Cushing was sitting in the front room, into which we were
      ushered. She was a placid-faced woman, with large, gentle eyes,
      and grizzled hair curving down over her temples on each side. A
      worked antimacassar lay upon her lap and a basket of coloured
      silks stood upon a stool beside her.
