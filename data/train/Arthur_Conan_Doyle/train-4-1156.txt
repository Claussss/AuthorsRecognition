‘Who the plague can this spark be?’ said the skipper. ‘Go on deck, Jem,
and tell him that I am counting my live stock, and that I shall be with
him anon.’ ‘Nay, your honour! There will trouble come of it unless you come up. He
swears that he will not bear to be put off, and that he must see you on
the instant.’ ‘Curse his blood, whoever he be!’ growled the seaman. ‘Every cock on
his own dunghill. What doth the rogue mean? Were he the Lord High Privy
Seal, I would have him to know that I am lord of my own quarter-deck!’
So saying, with many snorts of indignation, the mate and the captain
withdrew together up the ladder, banging the heavy hatchways down as
they passed through.
