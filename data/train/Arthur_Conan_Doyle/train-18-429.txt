The scent must have lain strongly upon the ground, for the dog never
hesitated nor stopped, dragging its master along at a pace which
rendered conversation impossible. At one place, in crossing a small stream, we seemed to get off the trail
for a few minutes, but our keen-nosed ally soon picked it up on the
other side and followed it over the trackless moor, whining and yelping
all the time in its eagerness. Had we not all three been fleet of foot
and long of wind, we could not have persisted in the continuous, rapid
journey over the roughest of ground, with the heather often well-nigh up
to our waists.
