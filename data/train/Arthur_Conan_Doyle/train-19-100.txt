But she has left a weight upon my heart.  Vague presentiments of coming
misfortune lie heavy upon me.  I try in vain to persuade myself that
these are only words of empty anger.  I can remember those relentless
eyes too clearly to think so.  What shall I do--ah, what shall I do?  I
am no longer master of my own soul.  At any moment this loathsome
parasite may creep into me, and then----  I must tell some one my
hideous secret--I must tell it or go mad.  If I had some one to
sympathize and advise!  Wilson is out of the question.  Charles Sadler
would understand me only so far as his own experience carries him.
Pratt-Haldane!  He is a well-balanced man, a man of great common-sense
and resource.  I will go to him.  I will tell him every thing.  God
grant that he may be able to advise me!
