“An almanac!” “Excellent, Watson! I am very much mistaken if you have not touched the

is in common use. It has the requisite number of pages. It is in double

I fear, a very auspicious beginning. Number one hundred and twenty-seven
is 'Government'; which at least makes sense, though somewhat irrelevant
to ourselves and Professor Moriarty. Now let us try again. What does the
Mahratta government do? Alas! the next word is 'pig's-bristles.' We are
undone, my good Watson! It is finished!”
