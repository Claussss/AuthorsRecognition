That night they camped at Mauron, where a small English and Breton
garrison held the castle. Right glad were the bowmen to see some of
their own countrymen once more, and they spent the night over wine and
dice, a crowd of Breton girls assisting, so that next morning their
bundles were much lighter, and most of the plunder of La Brohiniere was
left with the men and women of Mauron. Next day their march lay with a
fair sluggish river upon their right, and a great rolling forest upon
their left which covered the whole country. At last toward evening the
towers of Ploermel rose before them and they saw against a darkening sky
the Red Cross of England waving in the wind. So blue was the river Duc
which skirted the road, and so green its banks, that they might indeed
have been back beside their own homely streams, the Oxford Thames or
the Midland Trent, but ever as the darkness deepened there came in wild
gusts the howling of wolves from the forest to remind them that they
were in a land of war. So busy had men been for many years in hunting
one another that the beasts of the chase had grown to a monstrous
degree, until the streets of the towns were no longer safe from the wild
inroads of the fierce creatures, the wolves and the bears, who swarmed
around them.
