      It is indeed, a fearful place. The torrent, swollen by the
      melting snow, plunges into a tremendous abyss, from which the
      spray rolls up like the smoke from a burning house. The shaft
      into which the river hurls itself is an immense chasm, lined by
      glistening coal-black rock, and narrowing into a creaming,
      boiling pit of incalculable depth, which brims over and shoots
      the stream onward over its jagged lip. The long sweep of green
      water roaring forever down, and the thick flickering curtain of
      spray hissing forever upward, turn a man giddy with their
      constant whirl and clamour. We stood near the edge peering down
      at the gleam of the breaking water far below us against the black
      rocks, and listening to the half-human shout which came booming
      up with the spray out of the abyss.
