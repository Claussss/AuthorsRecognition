He had a crew of seven rough, hardy mariners, who had been at his back
in many a skirmish. They were armed with short swords, but Cock Badding
carried a weapon peculiar to himself, a twenty-pound blacksmith's
hammer, the memory of which, as “Badding's cracker,” still lingers
in the Cinque Ports. Then there were the eager Nigel, the melancholy
Aylward, Black Simon who was a tried swordsman, and three archers,
Baddlesmere, Masters and Dicon of Rye, all veterans of the French War.
The numbers in the two vessels might be about equal; but Badding as
he glanced at the bold harsh faces which looked to him for orders had
little fear for the result.
