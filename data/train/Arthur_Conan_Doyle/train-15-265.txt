It was evening in the port of Tyre, some eleven hundred years before
the coming of Christ. The city held, at that time, about a quarter of a
million of inhabitants, the majority of whom dwelt upon the mainland,
where the buildings of the wealthy merchants, each in its own tree-girt
garden, extended for seven miles along the coast. The great island,
however, from which the town got its name, lay out some distance from
the shore, and contained within its narrow borders the more famous of
the temples and public buildings. Of these temples the chief was that of
Melmoth, which covered with its long colonnades the greater part of that
side of the island which looked down upon the Sidonian port, so called
because only twenty miles away the older city of Sidon maintained a
constant stream of traffic with its rising offshoot.
