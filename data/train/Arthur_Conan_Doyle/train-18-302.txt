I was walking down the lane lost in thought, and had got as far as the
wicket gate which opens upon the Branksome lawn, when I was surprised to
hear my father's voice raised in most animated and excited converse. The old man had been of late so abstracted from the daily affairs of the
world, and so absorbed in his own special studies, that it was difficult
to engage his attention upon any ordinary, mundane topic. Curious to
know what it was that had drawn him so far out of himself, I opened
the gate softly, and walking quietly round the laurel bushes, found him
sitting, to my astonishment, with none other than the very man who was
occupying my thoughts, Ram Singh, the Buddhist.
