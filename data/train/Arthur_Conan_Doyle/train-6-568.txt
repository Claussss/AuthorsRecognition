Cosford on the slope of a long hill two leagues from the fair town of
Guildford?” “Say only that I sent my greeting, and that Saint Catharine has been my
friend--only that and nothing more. And now leave me, I pray you, for my
head is weary and I would fain have sleep.” Thus it came about that a month later on the eve of the Feast of Saint
Matthew, the Lady Mary, as she walked front Cosford gates, met with
a strange horseman, richly clad, a serving-man behind him, looking
shrewdly about him with quick blue eyes, which twinkled from a red and
freckled face. At sight of her he doffed his hat and reined his horse.
