So, with glitter of armor and flaunting of pennons, their warhorses
tossing and pawing, the champions rode down to the midway oak. Behind
them streamed hundreds of archers and men-at-arms whose weapons had been
wisely taken from them lest a general battle should ensue. With them
also went the townsfolk, men and women, together with wine-sellers,
provisions merchants, armorers, grooms and heralds, with surgeons to
tend the wounded and priests to shrive the dying. The path was blocked
by this throng, but all over the face of the country horsemen and
footmen, gentle and simple, men and women, could be seen speeding their
way to the scene of the encounter.
