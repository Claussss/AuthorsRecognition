thought to arouse from prayer or meditation, but never have I seen
such a holy exercise as this under an abbey's roof, with swords for
breviaries and archers for acolytes. I fear that I have come amiss, and
yet I ride on an errand from one who permits no delay.” The Abbot, and possibly the sacrist also, had begun to realize that
events had gone a great deal farther than they had intended, and that
without an extreme scandal it was no easy matter for them to save
their dignity and the good name of Waverley. Therefore, in spite of
the debonair, not to say disrespectful, bearing of the newcomer, they
rejoiced at his appearance and intervention.
