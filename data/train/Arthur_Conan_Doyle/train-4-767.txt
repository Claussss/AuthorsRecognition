‘There is a Captain Lockarby, who is serving in Colonel Saxon’s
regiment, in Monmouth’s army,’ said I. ‘Should things go wrong with me,
I would take it as a great kindness if you would bear him my love, and
ask him to break it gently, by word or by letter, to those at Havant.
If I were sure that this would be done, it would be a great ease to my
mind.’ ‘It shall be done, lad,’ said the good farmer. ‘I shall send my best man
and fleetest horse this very night, that they may know the straits in
which you are. I have a file here if it would help you.’
