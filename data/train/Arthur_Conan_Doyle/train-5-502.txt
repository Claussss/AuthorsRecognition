Dr. James Ripley was two-and-thirty years of age, reserved, learned,
unmarried, with set, rather stern features, and a thinning of the dark
hair upon the top of his head, which was worth quite a hundred a year
to him.  He was particularly happy in his management of ladies.  He had
caught the tone of bland sternness and decisive suavity which dominates
without offending.  Ladies, however, were not equally happy in their
management of him.  Professionally, he was always at their service.
Socially, he was a drop of quicksilver.  In vain the country mammas
spread out their simple lures in front of him.  Dances and picnics were
not to his taste, and he preferred during his scanty leisure to shut
himself up in his study, and to bury himself in Virchow's Archives and
the professional journals.
