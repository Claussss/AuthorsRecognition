‘I could fancy it a great boa,’ I remarked, ‘which was drawing its coils
round the town.’ ‘A rattlesnake, rather,’ said Reuben, pointing to the guns in the rear.
‘It keeps all its noise in its tail.’ ‘Here comes its head, if I mistake not,’ quoth Saxon. ‘It were best
perhaps that we stand at the side of the gate.’ As he spoke a group of gaily dressed cavaliers broke away from the main
body and rode straight for the town. Their leader was a tall, slim,
elegant young man, who sat his horse with the grace of a skilled rider,
and who was remarkable amongst those around him for the gallantry of his
bearing and the richness of his trappings. As he galloped towards the
gate a roar of welcome burst from the assembled multitude, which was
taken up and prolonged by the crowds behind, who, though unable to see
what was going forward, gathered from the shouting that the King was
approaching.
