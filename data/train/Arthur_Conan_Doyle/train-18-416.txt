_Evening_.--Have managed to compare notes with Gunner Rufus Smith of the
Artillery, who knocked the old fellow over with the butt of his gun. His
experience has been the same as mine. He has heard the sound, too. What
is the meaning of it all? My brain is in a whirl. Oct. 10 (four days later).--God help us! This last laconic entry terminated the journal. It seemed to me that,
coming as it did after four days' complete silence, it told a clearer
tale of shaken nerve and a broken spirit than could any more elaborate
narrative. Pinned on to the journal was a supplementary statement which
had evidently been recently added by the general.
