“You blasted traitor!” hissed McGinty through his closed teeth. “Ay, John McGinty, you may call me that if it eases your smart. You and
your like have been the enemy of God and man in these parts. It took
a man to get between you and the poor devils of men and women that you
held under your grip. There was just one way of doing it, and I did it.
You call me a traitor; but I guess there's many a thousand will call me
a deliverer that went down into hell to save them. I've had three months
of it. I wouldn't have three such months again if they let me loose
in the treasury at Washington for it. I had to stay till I had it all,
every man and every secret right here in this hand. I'd have waited
a little longer if it hadn't come to my knowledge that my secret was
coming out. A letter had come into the town that would have set you wise
to it all. Then I had to act and act quickly.
