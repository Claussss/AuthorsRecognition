Many of them, as was but natural, died violent deaths, some by
accident and a few by their own hands. No man of the first class
ever died in the ring. The nearest approach to it was the singular
and mournful fate which befell Simon Byrne, the brave Irishman,
who had the misfortune to cause the death of his antagonist, Angus
Mackay, and afterwards met his own end at the hands of Deaf Burke.
Neither Byrne nor Mackay could, however, be said to be boxers of the
very first rank. It certainly would appear, if we may argue from the
prize-ring, that the human machine becomes more delicate and is more
sensitive to jar or shock. In the early days a fatal end to a fight
was exceedingly rare. Gradually such tragedies became rather more
common, until now even with the gloves they have shocked us by their
frequency, and we feel that the rude play of our forefathers is
indeed too rough for a more highly organized generation. Still, it
may help us to clear our minds of cant if we remember that within
two or three years the hunting-field and the steeple-chase claim
more victims than the prize-ring has done in two centuries.
