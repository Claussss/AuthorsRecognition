Then the rain began to fall. All day it rained, and all the night
and all the week and all the month, until folk had forgotten the blue
heavens and the gleam of the sunshine. It was not heavy, but it was
steady and cold and unceasing, so that the people were weary of its
hissing and its splashing, with the slow drip from the eaves. Always the
same thick evil cloud flowed from east to west with the rain beneath
it. None could see for more than a bow-shot from their dwellings for the
drifting veil of the rain-storms. Every morning the folk looked upward
for a break, but their eyes rested always upon the same endless cloud,
until at last they ceased to look up, and their hearts despaired of
ever seeing the change. It was raining at Lammas-tide and raining at the
Feast of the Assumption and still raining at Michaelmas. The crops and
the hay, sodden and black, had rotted in the fields, for they were not
worth the garnering. The sheep had died, and the calves also, so there
was little to kill when Martinmas came and it was time to salt the meat
for the winter. They feared a famine, but it was worse than famine which
was in store for them.
