      “Because I feared that some false conclusion might be drawn from
      it and that I might find myself involved in a scandal.”       “And why were you so pressing that Sir Charles should destroy
      your letter?”       “If you have read the letter you will know.”       “I did not say that I had read all the letter.”       “You quoted some of it.”       “I quoted the postscript. The letter had, as I said, been burned
      and it was not all legible. I ask you once again why it was that
      you were so pressing that Sir Charles should destroy this letter
      which he received on the day of his death.”
