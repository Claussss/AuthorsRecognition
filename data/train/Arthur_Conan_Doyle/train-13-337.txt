      “‘It seemed that after we had left, Prendergast and his gang had
      proceeded to put to death the five remaining prisoners. The two
      warders had been shot and thrown overboard, and so also had the
      third mate. Prendergast then descended into the ’tween-decks and
      with his own hands cut the throat of the unfortunate surgeon.
      There only remained the first mate, who was a bold and active
      man. When he saw the convict approaching him with the bloody
      knife in his hand he kicked off his bonds, which he had somehow
      contrived to loosen, and rushing down the deck he plunged into
      the after-hold.
