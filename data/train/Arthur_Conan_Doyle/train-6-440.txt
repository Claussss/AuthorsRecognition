“Yet a little farther! Yet a little farther still!” he muttered. “The
wind is towards them and the fools have forgot that I can overshoot them
by fifty paces. Now, my good lord, I pray you for one instant to hold
the horses, for my weapon is of more avail this day, than thine can be.
They may make sorry cheer ere they gain the shelter of the wood once
more.” He had sprung from his horse, and with a downward wrench of his arm and
a push with his knee he slipped the string into the upper nock of his
mighty war-bow. Then in a flash he notched his shaft and drew it to
the pile, his keen blue eyes glowing fiercely behind it from under his
knotted brows. With thick legs planted sturdily apart, his body laid
to the bow, his left arm motionless as wood, his right bunched into a
double curve of swelling muscles as he stretched the white well-waxed
string, he looked so keen and fierce a fighter that the advancing line
stopped for an instant at the sight of him. Two or three loosed off
their arrows, but the shafts flew heavily against the head wind, and
snaked along the hard turf some score of paces short of the mark. One
only, a short bandy-legged man, whose squat figure spoke of enormous
muscular strength, ran swiftly in and then drew so strong a bow that the
arrow quivered in the ground at Aylward's very feet.
