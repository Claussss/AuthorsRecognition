The argument which I would advance is this.  If a strong
materialisation medium can throw out a cloud of stuff which is actually
visible, may not a medium of a less pronounced type throw out a similar
cloud with analogous properties which is not opaque enough to be seen
by the average eye, but can make an impression both on the dry plate in
the camera and on the clairvoyant faculty?  If that be so--and it would
not seem to be a very far-fetched proposition--we have at once an
explanation both of psychic photographs and of the visions of the
clairvoyant seer.  When I say an explanation, I mean of its superficial
method of formation, and not of the forces at work behind, which remain
no less a mystery even when we accept Dr. Geley's statement that they
are "ideoplastic."
