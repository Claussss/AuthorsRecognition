      “How do you get at that?”       “We might deduce it from the mere character of the one hand as
      compared with the other. But we have more assured reasons than
      that for supposing it. If you examine this scrap with attention
      you will come to the conclusion that the man with the stronger
      hand wrote all his words first, leaving blanks for the other to
      fill up. These blanks were not always sufficient, and you can see
      that the second man had a squeeze to fit his ‘quarter’ in between
      the ‘at’ and the ‘to,’ showing that the latter were already
      written. The man who wrote all his words first is undoubtedly the
      man who planned the affair.”
