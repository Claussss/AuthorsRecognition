“It will be the better if you stretch his limbs, for he grows
overheavy,” said the knight. “Now mark me, Nigel! Yonder betwixt the
ash-tree and the red rock what do you see on the side of the far hill?” “There is a white dot upon it. Surely it is a horse.” “I have marked it all morning, Nigel. This horseman has kept ever upon
our flank, spying upon us or waiting to make some attempt upon us. Now
I should be right glad to have a prisoner, for it is my wish to know
something of this country-side, and these peasants can speak neither
French nor English. I would have you linger here in hiding when we go
forward. This man will still follow us. When he does so, yonder wood
will lie betwixt you and him. Do you ride round it and come upon him
from behind. There is broad plain upon his left, and we will cut him
off upon the right. If your horse be indeed the swifter, then you cannot
fail to take him.”
