      My companion bowed.       “I’ve been down to Scotland Yard, Mr. Holmes. I saw Inspector
      Stanley Hopkins. He advised me to come to you. He said the case,
      so far as he could see, was more in your line than in that of the
      regular police.”       “Pray sit down and tell me what is the matter.”       “It’s awful, Mr. Holmes—simply awful I wonder my hair isn’t grey.
      Godfrey Staunton—you’ve heard of him, of course? He’s simply the
      hinge that the whole team turns on. I’d rather spare two from the
      pack, and have Godfrey for my three-quarter line. Whether it’s
      passing, or tackling, or dribbling, there’s no one to touch him,
      and then, he’s got the head, and can hold us all together. What
      am I to do? That’s what I ask you, Mr. Holmes. There’s Moorhouse,
      first reserve, but he is trained as a half, and he always edges
      right in on to the scrum instead of keeping out on the touchline.
      He’s a fine place-kick, it’s true, but then he has no judgment,
      and he can’t sprint for nuts. Why, Morton or Johnson, the Oxford
      fliers, could romp round him. Stevenson is fast enough, but he
      couldn’t drop from the twenty-five line, and a three-quarter who
      can’t either punt or drop isn’t worth a place for pace alone. No,
      Mr. Holmes, we are done unless you can help me to find Godfrey
      Staunton.”
