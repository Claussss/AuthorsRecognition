‘Here’s a pretty piece of work,’ said Saxon, kneeling by the dead man’s
side and passing his hands over his pockets. ‘Footpads, doubtless. Not a
stiver in his pockets, nor as much as a sleeve-link to help pay for the
burial.’ ‘How was he slain!’ I asked in horror, looking down at the poor vacant
face, the empty house from which the tenant had departed. ‘A stab from behind and a tap on the head from the butt of a pistol.
He cannot have been dead long, and yet every groat is gone. A man of
position, too, I should judge from his dress--broadcloth coat by the
feel, satin breeches, and silver buckles on his shoes. The rogues must
have had some plunder with him. Could we but run across them, Clarke, it
would be a great and grand thing.’
