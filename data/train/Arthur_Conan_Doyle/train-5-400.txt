"I told you that I know no Eastern tongue." "Ah, so you did.  It is the name of the embalmer, I take it.  A very
conscientious worker he must have been.  I wonder how many modern works

Abercrombie Smith that he was still palpitating with fear.  His hands
shook, his lower lip trembled, and look where he would, his eye always
came sliding round to his gruesome companion.  Through all his fear,
however, there was a suspicion of triumph in his tone and manner.  His
eye shone, and his footstep, as he paced the room, was brisk and
jaunty.  He gave the impression of a man who has gone through an
ordeal, the marks of which he still bears upon him, but which has
helped him to his end.
