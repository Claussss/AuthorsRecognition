But let not my last note upon the great duke be a carping one.
Rather let my final sentence be one which will remind you of his
frugal and abstemious life, his carpetless floor and little camp
bed, his precise courtesy which left no humblest letter unanswered,
his courage which never flinched, his tenacity which never faltered,
his sense of duty which made his life one long unselfish effort
on behalf of what seemed to him to be the highest interest of the
State. Go down and stand by the huge granite sarcophagus in the dim
light of the crypt of St. Paul's, and in the hush of that austere
spot, cast back your mind to the days when little England alone
stood firm against the greatest soldier and the greatest army that
the world has ever known. Then you feel what this dead man stood
for, and you pray that we may still find such another amongst us
when the clouds gather once again.
