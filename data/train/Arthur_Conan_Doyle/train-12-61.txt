“This isn't bad,” he said, holding up a great glowing yellow mass as
large as his own head. “It is really a very fine piece of amber. It
was forwarded to me by my agent at the Baltic. Twenty-eight pounds,
it weighs. I never heard of so fine a one. I have no very large
brilliants--there were no very large ones in the market--but my average
is good. Pretty toys, are they not?” He picked up a double handful of
emeralds from a drawer, and then let them trickle slowly back into the
heap.
