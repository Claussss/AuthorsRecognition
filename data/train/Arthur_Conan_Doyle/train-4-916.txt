‘Nay! but,’ I persisted, ‘you are a man, judging from what we have seen
of your courage and skill in the use of your weapons, who would gain
speedy preferment in any army. Surely it were better to use your gifts
to the gaining of honour and credit, than to make them a stepping-stone
to disgrace and the gallows?’ ‘For the gallows I care not a clipped shilling,’ the highwayman
answered, sending up thick blue curls of smoke into the morning air. ‘We
have all to pay nature’s debt, and whether I do it in my boots or on a
feather bed, in one year or in ten, matters as little to me as to any
soldier among you. As to disgrace, it is a matter of opinion. I see
no shame myself in taking a toll upon the wealth of the rich, since I
freely expose my own skin in the doing of it.’
