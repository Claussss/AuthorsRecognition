“It is ill weather for bows,” remarked John at last, when, with a long
sigh, he drained the last drop from his helmet. “My strings are as limp
as a cow's tail this morning.” “You should rub them with water glue,” quoth Johnston. “You remember,
Samkin, that it was wetter than this on the morning of Crecy, and yet I
cannot call to mind that there was aught amiss with our strings.” “It is in my thoughts,” said Black Simon, still pensively grinding his
sword, “that we may have need of your strings ere sundown. I dreamed of
the red cow last night.”
