“When first the occult sciences were pursued many thousands of years
ago, it was found by the learned that the short tenure of human
existence was too limited to allow a man to attain the loftiest heights
of inner life. The inquirers of those days directed their energies in
the first place, therefore, to the lengthening of their own days in
order that they might have more scope for improvement. “By their knowledge of the secret laws of Nature they were enabled to
fortify their bodies against disease and old age. It only remained to
protect themselves against the assaults of wicked and violent men who
are ever ready to destroy what is wiser and nobler than themselves.
There was no direct means by which this protection could be effected,
but it was in some measure attained by arranging the occult forces in
such a way that a terrible and unavoidable retribution should await the
offender.
