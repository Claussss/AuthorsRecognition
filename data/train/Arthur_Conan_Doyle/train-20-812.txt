      “Sit down, Captain Crocker. You got my telegram?”       Our visitor sank into an armchair and looked from one to the
      other of us with questioning eyes.       “I got your telegram, and I came at the hour you said. I heard
      that you had been down to the office. There was no getting away
      from you. Let’s hear the worst. What are you going to do with me?
      Arrest me? Speak out, man! You can’t sit there and play with me
      like a cat with a mouse.”
