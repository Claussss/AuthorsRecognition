Several women of the labouring class and one or two travellers who might
have been small local storekeepers made up the rest of the company, with
the exception of one young man in a corner by himself. It is with this
man that we are concerned. Take a good look at him; for he is worth it. He is a fresh-complexioned, middle-sized young man, not far, one would
guess, from his thirtieth year. He has large, shrewd, humorous gray eyes
which twinkle inquiringly from time to time as he looks round through
his spectacles at the people about him. It is easy to see that he is of
a sociable and possibly simple disposition, anxious to be friendly to
all men. Anyone could pick him at once as gregarious in his habits and
communicative in his nature, with a quick wit and a ready smile. And yet
the man who studied him more closely might discern a certain firmness
of jaw and grim tightness about the lips which would warn him that there
were depths beyond, and that this pleasant, brown-haired young Irishman
might conceivably leave his mark for good or evil upon any society to
which he was introduced.
