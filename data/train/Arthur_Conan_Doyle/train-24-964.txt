craning up his neck from the ground. “He stands on the further side of my mark,” answered the Brabanter, “so
he has little to fear from you.” “Well, the saints assoil him!” cried John. “Though I think he is
over-near to be scathed.” As he spoke he raised his two feet, with the
bow-stave upon their soles, and his cord twanged with a deep rich hum
which might be heard across the valley. The measurer in the distance
fell flat upon his face, and then jumping up again, he began to run in
the opposite direction.
