      “I have trusted you too long, Effie,” he cried, sternly. “Leave
      go of me! I must pass you. My friends and I are going to settle
      this matter once and forever!” He pushed her to one side, and we
      followed closely after him. As he threw the door open an old
      woman ran out in front of him and tried to bar his passage, but
      he thrust her back, and an instant afterwards we were all upon
      the stairs. Grant Munro rushed into the lighted room at the top,
      and we entered at his heels.
