“You told me to be kind to the next French officer whom I found in
distress,” said he. “Good luck! Bon voyage!” he whispered, as I bounded
into the saddle. “Remember, 'Poltava' is the watchword.” It was well that he had given it to me, for twice I had to pass Cossack
pickets before I was clear of the lines. I had just ridden past the last vedettes and hoped that I was a free man
again, when there was a soft thudding in the snow behind me, and a heavy
man upon a great black horse came swiftly after me. My first impulse was
to put spurs to Violette. My second, as I saw a long black beard against
a steel cuirass, was to halt and await him.
