Smaller than the royal gerfalcon, the Bishop's bird was none the less
a swift and beautiful creature. From her perch upon his wrist she had
watched with fierce, keen eyes the birds in the heaven, mantling herself
from time to time in her eagerness. Now when the button was undone
and the leash uncast the peregrine dashed off with a whir of her
sharp-pointed wings, whizzing round in a great ascending circle which
mounted swiftly upward, growing ever smaller as she approached that
lofty point where, a mere speck in the sky, the heron sought escape from
its enemies. Still higher and higher the two birds mounted, while the
horsemen, their faces upturned, strained their eyes in their efforts to
follow them.
