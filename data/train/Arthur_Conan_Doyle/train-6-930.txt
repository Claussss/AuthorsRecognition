Down the valley the slow stream meandered with marshy meadows on
either side. A mile or two lower a huge drove of horses were to be seen
assembled upon the bank. They were the steeds of the French cavalry,
and the blue haze of a hundred fires showed where King John's men were
camping. In front of the mound upon which they stood the English line
was drawn, but there were few fires, for indeed, save their horses,
there was little for them to cook. Their right rested upon the river,
and their array stretched across a mile of ground until the left was in
touch with a tangled forest which guarded it from flank attack. In front
was a long thick hedge and much broken ground, with a single deeply
rutted country road cutting through it in the middle. Under the hedge
and along the whole front of the position lay swarms of archers upon the
grass, the greater number slumbering peacefully with sprawling limbs
in the warm rays of the September sun. Behind were the quarters of the
various knights, and from end to end flew the banners and pennons marked
with the devices of the chivalry of England and Guienne.
