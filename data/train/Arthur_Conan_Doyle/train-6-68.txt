The result was but too successful, for it nearly brought about the
downfall of the rider. When those red eyes straining for death were
suddenly shrouded in unexpected darkness the amazed horse propped on its
forefeet and came to so dead a stop that Nigel was shot forward on to
its neck and hardly held himself by his hair-entwined hand. Ere he had
slid back into position the moment of danger had passed, for the horse,
its purpose all blurred in its mind by this strange thing which had
befallen, wheeled round once more, trembling in every fiber, and tossing
its petulant head until at last the mantle had been slipped from its
eyes and the chilling darkness had melted into the homely circle of
sunlit grass once more.
