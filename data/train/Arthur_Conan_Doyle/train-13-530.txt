      “Good-evening, doctor,” said Holmes, cheerily. “I am glad to see
      that you have only been waiting a very few minutes.”       “You spoke to my coachman, then?”       “No, it was the candle on the side-table that told me. Pray
      resume your seat and let me know how I can serve you.”       “My name is Doctor Percy Trevelyan,” said our visitor, “and I
      live at 403, Brook Street.”       “Are you not the author of a monograph upon obscure nervous
      lesions?” I asked.
