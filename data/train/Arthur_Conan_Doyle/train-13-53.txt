      “The horse was alone before,” I cried.       “Quite so. It was alone before. Hullo, what is this?”       The double track turned sharp off and took the direction of
      King’s Pyland. Holmes whistled, and we both followed along after
      it. His eyes were on the trail, but I happened to look a little
      to one side, and saw to my surprise the same tracks coming back
      again in the opposite direction.
