Robert Knolles looked grimly at the messenger. “You may thank the saints
that you have had my promise,” said he, “else would I have stripped that
lying tabard from thy back and the skin beneath it from thy bones, that
thy master might have a fitting answer to his message. Tell him that I
hold him and all that are within his castle as hostage for the lives of
my men, and that should he dare to do them scathe he and every man that
is with him shall hang upon his battlements. Go, and go quickly, lest my
patience fail.”
