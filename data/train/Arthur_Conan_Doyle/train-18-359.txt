Many signs, however, and chief among them the presence of the Buddhists
upon the coast as described by you this morning, have convinced me that
the weary waiting is at last over and that the hour of retribution is at
hand. Why I should have been allowed to live nearly forty years after my
offence is more than I can understand, but it is possible that those who
had command over my fate know that such a life is the greatest of all
penalties to me.
