“On the far side,” said the dragoman, waving his donkey-whip towards the
east, “is the military line which conducts Wady Haifa to Sarras. Sarras
lies to the south, under that black hill. Those two blue mountains which
you see very far away are in Dongola, more than a hundred miles from
Sarras. The railway there is forty miles long, and has been much annoyed
by the Dervishes, who are very glad to turn the rails into spears. The
telegraph wires are also much appreciated thereby. Now, if you will
kindly turn round, I will explain, also, what we see upon the other
side.”
