With the assured air of a man who knows exactly where he is and whither
he is going, the man-at-arms began to clamber up a narrow fern-lined
cleft among the rocks. It was no easy ascent in the darkness, but Simon
climbed on like an old dog hot upon a scent, and the panting Aylward
struggled after as best he might. At last they were at the summit and
the archer threw himself down upon the grass. “Nay, Simon, I have not enough breath to blow out a candle,” said he.
“Stint your haste for a minute, since we have a long night before us.
Surely this man is a friend indeed, if you hasten so to see him.”
