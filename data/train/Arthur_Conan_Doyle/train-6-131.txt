“Brother sacrist,” said the Abbot angrily, “methinks you show overmuch
zeal in this case, and certes, we are well able to uphold the dignity
and honor of the Abbey court without any rede of thine. As to you,
worthy summoner, you will give your opinion when we crave for it, and
not before, or you may yourself get some touch of the power of our
tribunal. But your case hath been tried, Squire Loring, and judgment
given. I have no more to say.”
