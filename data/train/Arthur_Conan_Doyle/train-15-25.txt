THE LAST GALLEY 
    "Mutato nomine, de te, Britannia, fabula narratur." It was a spring morning, one hundred and forty-six years before the
coming of Christ. The North African coast, with its broad hem of golden
sand, its green belt of feathery palm trees, and its background of
barren, red-scarped hills, shimmered like a dream country in the opal
light. Save for a narrow edge of snow-white surf, the Mediterranean lay
blue and serene as far as the eye could reach. In all its vast expanse
there was no break but for a single galley, which was slowly making its
way from the direction of Sicily and heading for the distant harbour of
Carthage.
