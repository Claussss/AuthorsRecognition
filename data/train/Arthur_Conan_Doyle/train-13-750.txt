      “Oh, come! Try the dish before you.”       “Thank you, I would really rather not.”       “Well, then,” said Holmes, with a mischievous twinkle, “I suppose
      that you have no objection to helping me?”       Phelps raised the cover, and as he did so he uttered a scream,
      and sat there staring with a face as white as the plate upon
      which he looked. Across the centre of it was lying a little
      cylinder of blue-grey paper. He caught it up, devoured it with
      his eyes, and then danced madly about the room, pressing it to
      his bosom and shrieking out in his delight. Then he fell back
      into an armchair so limp and exhausted with his own emotions that
      we had to pour brandy down his throat to keep him from fainting.
