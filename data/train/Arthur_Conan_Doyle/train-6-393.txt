But Edith pushed her away, and her fair cheeks were flushed with her
anger. “What right have you over me, Mary, you who are but two years
older, that you should follow me over the country-side as though I were
a runagate villain and you my mistress? Do you yourself go back, and
leave me to do that which seems best in my own eyes.” But Mary still held her in her arms, and still strove to soften the hard
and angry heart. “Our mother is dead, Edith. I thank God that she died
ere she saw you under this roof! But I stand for her, as I have done all
my life, since I am indeed your elder. It is with her voice that I beg
and pray you that you will not trust this man further, and that you will
come back ere it be too late!”
