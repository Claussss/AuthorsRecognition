‘Ah, my young friend!’ he said at last. ‘Is it, then, the custom of this
part of the country to carry your visitor’s rooms by storm or escalado
in the early hours of the morning?’ ‘Is it the custom,’ I answered sternly, ‘to barricade up your door when
you are sleeping under the roof-tree of an honest man? What did you
fear, that you should take such a precaution?’ ‘Nay, you are indeed a spitfire,’ he replied, sinking back upon the
pillow, and drawing the clothes round him, ‘a feuerkopf as the Germans
call it, or sometimes tollkopf, which in its literal significance
meaneth a fool’s head. Your father was, as I have heard, a strong and a
fierce man when the blood of youth ran in his veins; but you, I should
judge, are in no way behind him. Know, then, that the bearer of papers
of import, _documenta preciosa sed periculosa_, is bound to leave
nought to chance, but to guard in every way the charge which hath been
committed to him. True it is that I am in the house of an honest man,
but I know not who may come or who may go during the hours of the night.
Indeed, for the matter of that--but enough is said. I shall be with you
anon.’
