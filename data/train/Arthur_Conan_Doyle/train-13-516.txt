      “Well, though I had her heart, her father was set upon her
      marrying Barclay. I was a harum-scarum, reckless lad, and he had
      had an education, and was already marked for the sword-belt. But
      the girl held true to me, and it seemed that I would have had her
      when the Mutiny broke out, and all hell was loose in the country.       “We were shut up in Bhurtee, the regiment of us with half a
      battery of artillery, a company of Sikhs, and a lot of civilians
      and women-folk. There were ten thousand rebels round us, and they
      were as keen as a set of terriers round a rat-cage. About the
      second week of it our water gave out, and it was a question
      whether we could communicate with General Neill’s column, which
      was moving up country. It was our only chance, for we could not
      hope to fight our way out with all the women and children, so I
      volunteered to go out and to warn General Neill of our danger. My
      offer was accepted, and I talked it over with Sergeant Barclay,
      who was supposed to know the ground better than any other man,
      and who drew up a route by which I might get through the rebel
      lines. At ten o’clock the same night I started off upon my
      journey. There were a thousand lives to save, but it was of only
      one that I was thinking when I dropped over the wall that night.
