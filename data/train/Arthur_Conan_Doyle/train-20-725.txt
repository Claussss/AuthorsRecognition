      “I have heard your name, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and I am aware of
      your profession—one of which I by no means approve.”       “In that, Doctor, you will find yourself in agreement with every
      criminal in the country,” said my friend, quietly.       “So far as your efforts are directed towards the suppression of
      crime, sir, they must have the support of every reasonable member
      of the community, though I cannot doubt that the official
      machinery is amply sufficient for the purpose. Where your calling
      is more open to criticism is when you pry into the secrets of
      private individuals, when you rake up family matters which are
      better hidden, and when you incidentally waste the time of men
      who are more busy than yourself. At the present moment, for
      example, I should be writing a treatise instead of conversing
      with you.”
