The long line of camels moved as noiselessly as ghosts across the
desert. Before and behind were the silent swaying white figures of the
Arabs. Not a sound anywhere, not the very faintest sound, until far
away behind them they heard a human voice singing in a strong, droning,
unmusical fashion. It had the strangest effect, this far-away voice,
in that huge inarticulate wilderness. And then there came a well-known
rhythm into that distant chant, and they could almost hear the words: We
nightly pitch our moving tent A day's march nearer home.
