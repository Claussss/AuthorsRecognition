Hubert,” said Chandos. “On your feet I know well that I should not see
your back as we have seen it to-day. Say what you will, your horse has
played you false, and I claim your suit of harness for Nigel Loring.” “Your tongue is overlong, John, and I am weary of its endless clack!”
 said Sir Hubert, his yellow mustache bristling from a scarlet face. “If
you claim my harness, do you yourself come and take it. If there is a
moon in the sky you may try this very night when the board is cleared.”
