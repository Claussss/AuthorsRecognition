      â€œThere was a coloured gas-lamp inside which was turned so low
      that I could see little save that the hall was of some size and
      hung with pictures. In the dim light I could make out that the
      person who had opened the door was a small, mean-looking,
      middle-aged man with rounded shoulders. As he turned towards us
      the glint of the light showed me that he was wearing glasses.
