      “Was it she who gave the alarm?”       “She and Mrs. King, the cook.”       “Where are they now?”       “In the kitchen, I believe.”       “Then I think we had better hear their story at once.”       The old hall, oak-panelled and high-windowed, had been turned
      into a court of investigation. Holmes sat in a great,
      old-fashioned chair, his inexorable eyes gleaming out of his
      haggard face. I could read in them a set purpose to devote his
      life to this quest until the client whom he had failed to save
      should at last be avenged. The trim Inspector Martin, the old,
      grey-headed country doctor, myself, and a stolid village
      policeman made up the rest of that strange company.
