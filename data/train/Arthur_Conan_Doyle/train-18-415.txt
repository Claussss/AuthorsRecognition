Can the fellow's threats have something in them and this be the warning
bell of which he spoke? Surely it is impossible. Yet his manner was
indescribably impressive. I have tried to set down what he said as accurately as I can, but I

to Chamberlain or Elliott. They tell me I am looking like a ghost this
morning.
