“The same fate shall be meted out to the wretched soldier, Smith, who,
though less guilty than yourself, has incurred the same penalty by
raising his sacrilegious hand against the chosen of Buddha. If your
life is prolonged, it is merely that you may have time to repent of your
misdeed and to feel the full force of your punishment. “And lest you should be tempted to cast it out of your mind and to
forget it, our bell--our astral bell, the use of which is one of our
occult secrets--shall ever remind you of what have been and what is to
be. You shall hear it by day and you shall hear it by night, and it will
be a sign to you that do what you may and go where you will, you can
never shake yourself clear of the _chelas_ of Ghoolab Shah.
