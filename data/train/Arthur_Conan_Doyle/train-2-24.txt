“No, there was no attempt at robbery.” “This is very painful—very painful and terrible,” said Mr. Scott Eccles
in a querulous voice, “but it is really uncommonly hard on me. I had
nothing to do with my host going off upon a nocturnal excursion and
meeting so sad an end. How do I come to be mixed up with the case?” “Very simply, sir,” Inspector Baynes answered. “The only document found
in the pocket of the deceased was a letter from you saying that you
would be with him on the night of his death. It was the envelope of
this letter which gave us the dead man’s name and address. It was after
nine this morning when we reached his house and found neither you nor
anyone else inside it. I wired to Mr. Gregson to run you down in London
while I examined Wisteria Lodge. Then I came into town, joined Mr.
Gregson, and here we are.”
