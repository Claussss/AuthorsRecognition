If it were grim and desolate upon the English border, however, what
can describe the hideous barrenness of this ten times harried tract
of France? The whole face of the country was scarred and disfigured,
mottled over with the black blotches of burned farm-steadings, and
the gray, gaunt gable-ends of what had been chateaux. Broken fences,
crumbling walls, vineyards littered with stones, the shattered arches of
bridges--look where you might, the signs of ruin and rapine met the eye.
Here and there only, on the farthest sky-line, the gnarled turrets of a
castle, or the graceful pinnacles of church or of monastery showed where
the forces of the sword or of the spirit had preserved some small islet
of security in this universal flood of misery. Moodily and in silence
the little party rode along the narrow and irregular track, their hearts
weighed down by this far-stretching land of despair. It was indeed
a stricken and a blighted country, and a man might have ridden from
Auvergne in the north to the marches of Foix, nor ever seen a smiling
village or a thriving homestead.
