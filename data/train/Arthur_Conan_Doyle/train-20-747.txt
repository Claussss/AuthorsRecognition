      The dog had suddenly turned out of the main road into a
      grass-grown lane. Half a mile farther this opened into another
      broad road, and the trail turned hard to the right in the
      direction of the town, which we had just quitted. The road took a
      sweep to the south of the town, and continued in the opposite
      direction to that in which we started.       “This _détour_ has been entirely for our benefit, then?” said
      Holmes. “No wonder that my inquiries among those villagers led to
      nothing. The doctor has certainly played the game for all it is
      worth, and one would like to know the reason for such elaborate
      deception. This should be the village of Trumpington to the right
      of us. And, by Jove! here is the brougham coming round the
      corner. Quick, Watson—quick, or we are done!”
