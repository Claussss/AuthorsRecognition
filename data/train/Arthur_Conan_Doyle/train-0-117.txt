“Is that her ring?” I asked. “The Lord be thanked!” cried the old woman; “Sally will be a glad woman
this night. That’s the ring.” “And what may your address be?” I inquired, taking up a pencil. “13, Duncan Street, Houndsditch. A weary way from here.” “The Brixton Road does not lie between any circus and Houndsditch,” said
Sherlock Holmes sharply. The old woman faced round and looked keenly at him from her little
red-rimmed eyes. “The gentleman asked me for _my_ address,” she said.
“Sally lives in lodgings at 3, Mayfield Place, Peckham.”
