      “‘What do you want with me?’ I asked.       “‘Only to ask a few questions of a Greek gentleman who is
      visiting us, and to let us have the answers. But say no more than
      you are told to say, or’—here came the nervous giggle again—‘you
      had better never have been born.’       “As he spoke he opened a door and showed the way into a room
      which appeared to be very richly furnished, but again the only
      light was afforded by a single lamp half-turned down. The chamber
      was certainly large, and the way in which my feet sank into the
      carpet as I stepped across it told me of its richness. I caught
      glimpses of velvet chairs, a high white marble mantel-piece, and
      what seemed to be a suit of Japanese armour at one side of it.
      There was a chair just under the lamp, and the elderly man
      motioned that I should sit in it. The younger had left us, but he
      suddenly returned through another door, leading with him a
      gentleman clad in some sort of loose dressing-gown who moved
      slowly towards us. As he came into the circle of dim light which
      enables me to see him more clearly I was thrilled with horror at
      his appearance. He was deadly pale and terribly emaciated, with
      the protruding, brilliant eyes of a man whose spirit was greater
      than his strength. But what shocked me more than any signs of
      physical weakness was that his face was grotesquely criss-crossed
      with sticking-plaster, and that one large pad of it was fastened
      over his mouth.
