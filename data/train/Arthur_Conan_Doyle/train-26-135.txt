It was all attuned to the sedate life of that, the last of the quiet
centuries. In the lonely country-house, with few letters and fewer
papers, do you suppose that the readers ever complained of the
length of a book, or could have too much of the happy Pamela or of
the unhappy Clarissa? It is only under extraordinary circumstances
that one can now get into that receptive frame of mind which was
normal then. Such an occasion is recorded by Macaulay, when he tells
how in some Indian hill station, where books were rare, he let loose
a copy of "Clarissa." The effect was what might have been expected.
Richardson in a suitable environment went through the community
like a mild fever. They lived him, and dreamed him, until the whole
episode passed into literary history, never to be forgotten by those
who experienced it. It is tuned, for every ear. That beautiful style
is so correct and yet so simple that there is no page which a
scholar may not applaud nor a servant-maid understand.
