Parkman is worth reading, if it were only for his account of the
Indians. Perhaps the very strangest thing about them, and the most
unaccountable, is their small numbers. The Iroquois were one of the
most formidable of tribes. They were of the Five Nations, whose
scalping-parties wandered over an expanse of thousands of square
miles. Yet there is good reason to doubt whether the whole five
nations could have put as many thousand warriors in the field. It
was the same with all the other tribes of Northern Americans, both
in the east, the north, and the west. Their numbers were always
insignificant. And yet they had that huge country to themselves,
the best of climates, and plenty of food. Why was it that they did
not people it thickly? It may be taken as a striking example of the
purpose and design which run through the affairs of men, that at the
very moment when the old world was ready to overflow the new world
was empty to receive it. Had North America been peopled as China
is peopled, the Europeans might have founded some settlements, but
could never have taken possession of the continent. Buffon has made
the striking remark that the creative power appeared to have never
had great vigour in America. He alluded to the abundance of the
flora and fauna as compared with that of other great divisions of
the earth's surface. Whether the numbers of the Indians are an
illustration of the same fact, or whether there is some special
cause, is beyond my very modest scientific attainments. When one
reflects upon the countless herds of bison which used to cover the
Western plains, or marks in the present day the race statistics
of the French Canadians at one end of the continent, and of the
Southern negro at the other, it seems absurd to suppose that there
is any geographical reason against Nature being as prolific here
as elsewhere. However, these be deeper waters, and with your leave
we will get back into my usual six-inch wading-depth once more.
