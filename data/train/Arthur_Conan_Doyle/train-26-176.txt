You see that the literature of Waterloo is well represented in my
small military library. Of all books dealing with the personal
view of the matter, I think that "Siborne's Letters," which is a
collection of the narratives of surviving officers made by Siborne
in the year 1827, is the most interesting. Gronow's account is
also very vivid and interesting. Of the strategical narratives,
Houssaye's book is my favourite. Taken from the French point of
view, it gets the actions of the allies in truer perspective than
any English or German account can do; but there is a fascination
about that great combat which makes every narrative that bears upon
it of enthralling interest.
