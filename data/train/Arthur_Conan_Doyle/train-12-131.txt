“I have caught them in my patent burglar trap,” said Haw. “They are my
first birds, but I have no doubt that they will not be the last. I will
show you how it works. It is quite a new thing. This flooring is now
as strong as possible, but every night I disconnect it. It is done
simultaneously by a central machine for every room on the ground-floor.
When the floor is disconnected one may advance three or four steps,
either from the window or door, and then that whole part turns on a
hinge and slides you into a padded strong-room beneath, where you may
kick your heels until you are released. There is a central oasis between
the hinges, where the furniture is grouped for the night. The flooring
flies into position again when the weight of the intruder is removed,
and there he must bide, while I can always take a peep at him by this
simple little optical arrangement. I thought it might amuse you to have
a look at my prisoners before I handed them over to the head-constable,
who I see is now coming up the avenue.”
