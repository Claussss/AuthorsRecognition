for many,” said he, “and it is but right that my comrades should know
it. I have no need of monk or friar, for I cannot think that harm will
ever come beyond the grave to one who has borne himself as a knight
should, but others have other thoughts upon these matters and would fain
have time for prayer and penitence. Adieu, fair sirs, and I drink a last
glass to a happy meeting at the midway oak.”
