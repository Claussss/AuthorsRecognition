      “His companion!”       Holmes pulled a large sheet of tissue-paper out of his pocket and
      carefully unfolded it upon his knee.       “What do you make of that?” he asked.       The paper was covered with the tracings of the footmarks of some
      small animal. It had five well-marked footpads, an indication of
      long nails, and the whole print might be nearly as large as a
      dessert-spoon.
