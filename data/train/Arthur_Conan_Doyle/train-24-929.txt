The broken and rugged road had wound along the crests of low hills,
with wooded ridges on either side of it over which peeped the loftier
mountains, the distant Peak of the South and the vast Altabisca, which
towered high above them and cast its black shadow from left to right
across the valley. From where they now stood they could look forward
down a long vista of beech woods and jagged rock-strewn wilderness, all
white with snow, to where the pass opened out upon the uplands beyond.
Behind them they could still catch a glimpse of the gray plains of
Gascony, and could see her rivers gleaming like coils of silver in the
sunshine. As far as eye could see from among the rocky gorges and the
bristles of the pine woods there came the quick twinkle and glitter of
steel, while the wind brought with it sudden distant bursts of martial
music from the great host which rolled by every road and by-path towards
the narrow pass of Roncesvalles. On the cliffs on either side might also
be seen the flash of arms and the waving of pennons where the force of
Navarre looked down upon the army of strangers who passed through their
territories.
