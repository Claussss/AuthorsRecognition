A tall man clad in a long white robe, with a golden fillet running
through his flowing auburn hair, was striding down the street with the
free elastic gait of one who has lived an active life in the open. His
face was ruddy and noble, with a short, crisp beard covering a strong,
square jaw. In his clear blue eyes as he looked at the evening sky and
the busy waters beneath him there was something of the exaltation of the
poet, while a youth walking beside him and carrying a harp hinted at the
graces of music. On the other side of him, however, a second squire bore
a brazen shield and a heavy spear, so that his master might never be
caught unawares by his enemies. In his train there came a tumultuous
rabble of dark hawk-like men, armed to the teeth, and peering about with
covetous eyes at the signs of wealth which lay in profusion around them.
They were swarthy as Arabs, and yet they were better clad and better
armed than the wild children of the desert.
