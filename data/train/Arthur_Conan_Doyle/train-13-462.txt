      “Excellent!” cried Mr. Acton.       “But very superficial,” said Holmes. “We come now, however, to a
      point which is of importance. You may not be aware that the
      deduction of a man’s age from his writing is one which has been
      brought to considerable accuracy by experts. In normal cases one
      can place a man in his true decade with tolerable confidence. I
      say normal cases, because ill-health and physical weakness
      reproduce the signs of old age, even when the invalid is a youth.
      In this case, looking at the bold, strong hand of the one, and
      the rather broken-backed appearance of the other, which still
      retains its legibility although the t’s have begun to lose their
      crossing, we can say that the one was a young man and the other
      was advanced in years without being positively decrepit.”
