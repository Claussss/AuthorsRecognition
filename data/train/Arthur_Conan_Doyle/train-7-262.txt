going to come through all right. The Gippy Camel Corps are hot on our
trail.” “How do you know?” “What else could have scared them?” “O Colonel, do you really think we shall be saved?” sobbed Sadie. The
dull routine of misery through which they had passed had deadened all
their nerves until they seemed incapable of any acute sensation, but now
this sudden return of hope brought agony with it like the recovery of
a frostbitten limb. Even the strong, self-contained Belmont was filled
with doubts and apprehensions. He had been hopeful when there was no
sign of relief, and now the approach of it set him trembling.
