He shook my hand and set off down the road, but he came running after me
presently, calling me to stop. “I was just thinking,” he said, “that you must consider us a great
mystery up there at Cloomber. I dare say you have come to look upon
it as a private lunatic asylum, and I can't blame you. If you are
interested in the matter, I feel it is unfriendly upon my part not to
satisfy your curiosity, but I have promised my father to be silent about
it. And indeed if I were to tell you all that I know you might not
be very much the wiser after all. I would have you understand this,
however--that my father is as sane as you or I, and that he has very
good reasons for living the life which he does. I may add that his wish
to remain secluded does not arise from any unworthy or dishonourable
motives, but merely from the instinct of self-preservation.”
