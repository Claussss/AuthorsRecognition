Slowly the gallant Beaumanoir led the twenty-five men who were left
to their original station, where they opened their visors and threw
themselves down upon the grass, panting like weary dogs, and wiping the
sweat from their bloodshot eyes. A pitcher of wine of Anjou was carried
round by a page, and each in turn drained a cup, save only Beaumanoir
who kept his Lent with such strictness that neither food nor drink might
pass his lips before sunset. He paced slowly amongst his men, croaking
forth encouragement from his parched lips and pointing out to them that
among the English there was scarce a man who was not wounded, and some
so sorely that they could hardly stand. If the fight so far had gone
against them, there were still five hours of daylight, and much might
happen before the last of them was laid upon his back.
