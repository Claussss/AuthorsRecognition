      It argues the degree in which I had lost touch with my profession
      that the name of Leslie Armstrong was unknown to me. Now I am
      aware that he is not only one of the heads of the medical school
      of the university, but a thinker of European reputation in more
      than one branch of science. Yet even without knowing his
      brilliant record one could not fail to be impressed by a mere
      glance at the man, the square, massive face, the brooding eyes
      under the thatched brows, and the granite moulding of the
      inflexible jaw. A man of deep character, a man with an alert
      mind, grim, ascetic, self-contained, formidable—so I read Dr.
      Leslie Armstrong. He held my friend’s card in his hand, and he
      looked up with no very pleased expression upon his dour features.
