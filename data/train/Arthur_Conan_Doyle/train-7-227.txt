The wells in the centre of the grove consisted of seven large and two
small saucerlike cavities filled with peat-coloured water enough to form
a plentiful supply for any caravan. Camels and men drank it greedily,
though it was tainted by the all-pervading natron. The camels were
picketed, the Arabs threw their sleeping-mats down in the shade, and
the prisoners, after receiving a ration of dates and of doora, were told
that they might do what they would during the heat of the day, and that
the Moolah would come to them before sunset. The ladies were given the
thicker shade of an acacia tree, and the men lay down under the palms.
The great green leaves swished slowly above them; they heard the low hum
of the Arab talk, and the dull champing of the camels, and then in an
instant, by that most mysterious and least understood of miracles, one
was in a green Irish valley, and another saw the long straight line
of Commonwealth Avenue, and a third was dining at a little round table
opposite to the bust of Nelson in the Army and Navy Club, and for
him the swishing of the palm branches had been transformed into the
long-drawn hum of Pall Mall. So the spirits went their several ways,
wandering back along strange, untraced tracks of the memory, while the
weary, grimy bodies lay senseless under the palm-trees in the Oasis of
the Libyan Desert.
