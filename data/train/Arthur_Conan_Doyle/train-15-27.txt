But approach and look at her now! What are these dark streaks which foul
her white decks and dapple her brazen shields? Why do the long red oars
move out of time, irregular, convulsive? Why are some missing from the
staring portholes, some snapped with jagged, yellow edges, some trailing
inert against the sides? Why are two prongs of the brazen ram twisted
and broken? See, even the high image of Baal is battered and disfigured!
By every sign this ship has passed through some grievous trial, some day
of terror, which has left its heavy marks upon her.
