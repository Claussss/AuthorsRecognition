“You held your own bravely,” I answered, “but what is your impression of
the man now that you have seen him?” “Why,” said my father, “he is one of those holy men who, under the
various names of Sannasis, Yogis, Sevras, Qualanders, Hakims, and Cufis
have devoted their lives to the study of the mysteries of the Buddhist
faith. He is, I take it, a theosophist, or worshipper of the God of
knowledge, the highest grade of which is the adept. This man and his
companions have not attained this high position or they could not have
crossed the sea without contamination. It is probable that they are all
advanced chelas who hope in time to attain to the supreme honour of
adeptship.”
