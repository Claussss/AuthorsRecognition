Stretched upon a couch in a low-roofed and ill-furnished chamber, which
looks down from under the machicolated corner turret upon the inner
court of the Castle of Calais, he lay half-unconscious and impotent,
while great deeds were doing under his window. Wounded in three places,
and with his head splintered by the sharp pommel of the Ferret's mace,
he hovered betwixt life and death, his shattered body drawing him
downward, his youthful spirit plucking him up.
