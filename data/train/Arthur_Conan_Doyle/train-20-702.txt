      to make your preparations for your match without reference to
      this young gentleman. It must, as you say, have been an
      overpowering necessity which tore him away in such a fashion, and
      the same necessity is likely to hold him away. Let us step round
      together to the hotel, and see if the porter can throw any fresh
      light upon the matter.”
