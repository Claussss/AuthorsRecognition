“I bear in mind that my father was wont to say that they were very stout
spearmen.” “No better in the world, for the spears are twelve foot long and they
hold them in very thick array; but their archers are weak, save only the
men of Ettrick and Selkirk who come from the forest. I pray you to open
the lattice, Nigel, for the steam is overthick. Now in Wales it is the
spearmen who are weak, and there are no archers in these islands like
the men of Gwent with their bows of elm, which shoot with such power
that I have known a cavalier to have his horse killed when the shaft
had passed through his mail breeches, his thigh and his saddle. And yet,
what is the most strongly shot arrow to these new balls of iron driven
by the fire-powder which will crush a man's armor as an egg is crushed
by a stone? Our fathers knew them not.”
