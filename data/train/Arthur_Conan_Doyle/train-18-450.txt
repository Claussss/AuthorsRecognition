Oh, the wearisome, tedious journey! It had seemed long enough when we
had some slight flicker of hope, or at least of expectation, before us,
but now that our worst fears were fulfilled it appeared interminable. We picked up our peasant guide at the outskirts of the marsh, and having
restored his dog we let him find his own way home, without telling him
anything of the results of our expedition. We ourselves plodded all
day over the moors with heavy feet and heavier hearts until we saw the
ill-omened tower of Cloomber, and at last, as the sun was setting, found
ourselves once more beneath its roof.
