“Tell me, friend,” said Alleyne to the portly red-faced inn-keeper, “has
a knight and a squire passed this way within the hour?” “Nay, sir, it would be two hours back. Was he a small man, weak in the
eyes, with a want of hair, and speaks very quiet when he is most to be
feared?” “The same,” the squire answered. “But I marvel how you should know how
he speaks when he is in wrath, for he is very gentle-minded with those
who are beneath him.”
