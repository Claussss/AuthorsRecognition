“Good land, what a sight you are, Sadie!” cried Miss Adams, suddenly,
and it was the first reappearance of her old self. “What _would_ your
mother say if she saw you? Why, sakes alive, your hair is full of straw
and your frock clean crazy!” “I guess we all want some setting to right,” said Sadie, in a voice
which was much more subdued than that of the Sadie of old. “Mrs.
Belmont, you look just too perfectly sweet anyhow, but if you'll allow
me, I'll fix your dress for you.”
