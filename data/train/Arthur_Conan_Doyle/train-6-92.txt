gear, even as I have found my own horse, for I had rather ride into

we may get the money,” said the old woman sadly. “It was different in
the days of my father. I can remember that a suit of mail was but a
small matter in those days, for in every English town such things could
be made. But year by year since men have come to take more care of their
bodies, there have been added a plate of proof here and a cunning joint
there, and all must be from Toledo or Milan, so that a knight must have
much metal in his purse ere he puts any on his limbs.”
