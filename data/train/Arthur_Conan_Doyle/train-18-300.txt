It was difficult for me to associate the noble-faced Ram Singh's gentle,
refined manner and words of wisdom with any deed of violence, yet now
that I thought of it I could see that a terrible capacity for wrath lay
behind his shaggy brows and dark, piercing eyes. I felt that of all men whom I had ever met he was the one whose
displeasure I should least care to face. But how could two men so
widely dissociated as the foul-mouthed old corporal of artillery and
the distinguished Anglo-Indian general have each earned the ill-will of
these strange castaways? And if the danger were a positive physical one,
why should he not consent to my proposal to have the three men placed
under custody--though I confess it would have gone much against my grain
to act in so inhospitable a manner upon such vague and shadowy grounds.
