CHAPTER XVI. AT THE HOLE OF CREE It was dark enough when we started to make it no easy matter to find our
way across the moors, but as we advanced it grew lighter and lighter,
until by the time we reached Fullarton's cabin it was broad daylight. Early as it was, he was up and about, for the Wigtown peasants are an
early rising race. We explained our mission to him in as few words as
possible, and having made his bargain--what Scot ever neglected that
preliminary?--he agreed not only to let us have the use of his dog but
to come with us himself.
