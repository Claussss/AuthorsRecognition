March 25.  I am amazed, confounded.  It is clear that I must reconsider
my opinion upon this matter.  But first let me place on record what has
occurred. I had finished breakfast, and was looking over some diagrams with which
my lecture is to be illustrated, when my housekeeper entered to tell me
that Agatha was in my study and wished to see me immediately.  I
glanced at the clock and saw with sun rise that it was only half-past
nine.
