Such is his melancholy report. The fact is that the England of that
day seems to have been very full of that hereditary form of chronic
ill-health which we call by the general name of struma. How far
the hard-drinking habits in vogue for a century or so before had
anything to do with it I cannot say, nor can I trace a connection
between struma and learning; but one has only to compare this
account of Gibbon with Johnson's nervous twitches, his scarred face
and his St. Vitus' dance, to realize that these, the two most solid
English writers of their generation, were each heir to the same
gruesome inheritance.
