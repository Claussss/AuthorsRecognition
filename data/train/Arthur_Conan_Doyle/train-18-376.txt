It is hard when others are gaining glory and experience to be stuck in
this miserable valley. I have been out of it completely, bar a few petty
skirmishes. However, we may see some service yet. A jemidar of ours brought in a Hillman today, who says that the tribes
are massing in the Terada ravine, ten miles to the north of us, and
intend attacking the next convoy. We can't rely on information of this
sort, but there may prove to be some truth in it. Proposed to shoot our
informant, so as to prevent his playing the double traitor and reporting
our proceedings. Elliott demurred.
