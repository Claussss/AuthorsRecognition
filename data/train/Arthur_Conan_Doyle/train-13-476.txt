      just where the light strikes it. No, thank you, I had some supper
      at Waterloo, but I’ll smoke a pipe with you with pleasure.”       I handed him my pouch, and he seated himself opposite to me and
      smoked for some time in silence. I was well aware that nothing
      but business of importance would have brought him to me at such
      an hour, so I waited patiently until he should come round to it.
