The two knights had come aboard the cog, and the grapplings having been
thrown off, the three vessels now moved abreast. Through all the storm
and rush of the fight Alleyne had been aware of the voice of Goodwin
Hawtayne, the master-shipman, with his constant “Hale the bowline!
Veer the sheet!” and strange it was to him to see how swiftly the
blood-stained sailors turned from the strife to the ropes and back. Now
the cog's head was turned Francewards, and the shipman walked the deck,
a peaceful master-mariner once more.
