Shortly after the contest had begun, any one looking from the lists
along this road might have remarked, far away in the extreme distance,
two brilliant and sparkling points which glittered and twinkled in
the bright shimmer of the winter sun. Within an hour these had become
clearer and nearer, until they might be seen to come from the reflection
from the head-pieces of two horsemen who were riding at the top of their
speed in the direction of Bordeaux. Another half-hour had brought
them so close that every point of their bearing and equipment could be
discerned. The first was a knight in full armor, mounted upon a brown
horse with a white blaze upon breast and forehead. He was a short man of
great breadth of shoulder, with vizor closed, and no blazonry upon his
simple white surcoat or plain black shield. The other, who was evidently
his squire and attendant, was unarmed save for the helmet upon his
head, but bore in his right hand a very long and heavy oaken spear which
belonged to his master. In his left hand the squire held not only the
reins of his own horse but those of a great black war-horse, fully
harnessed, which trotted along at his side. Thus the three horses and
their two riders rode swiftly to the lists, and it was the blare of the
trumpet sounded by the squire as his lord rode into the arena which
had broken in upon the prize-giving and drawn away the attention and
interest of the spectators.
