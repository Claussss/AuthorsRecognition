For good or bad, many books have gone to the building of this one. I
look round my study table and I survey those which lie with me at the
moment, before I happily disperse them forever. I see La Croix's
“Middle Ages,” Oman's “Art of War,” Rietstap's “Armorial General,” De la
Borderie's “Histoire de Bretagne,” Dame Berner's “Boke of St. Albans,”
 “The Chronicle of Jocelyn of Brokeland,” “The Old Road,” Hewitt's
“Ancient Armour,” Coussan's “Heraldry,” Boutell's “Arms,” Browne's
“Chaucer's England,” Cust's “Scenes of the Middle Ages,” Husserand's
“Wayfaring Life,” Ward's “Canterbury Pilgrims;” Cornish's “Chivalry,”
 Hastings' “British Archer,” Strutt's “Sports,” Johnes Froissart,
Hargrove's “Archery,” Longman's “Edward III,” Wright's “Domestic
Manners.” With these and many others I have lived for months. If I have
been unable to combine and transfer their effect, the fault is mine.
