She stopped and gave a gasp for breath. "You are faint,"  said the Professor--"keep the head low; it aids the
cerebral circulation."  He flattened down the cushion.  "I am sorry to
leave you, O'Brien; but I have my class duties to look to.  Possibly I
may find you here when I return." With a grim and rigid face he strode out of the room.  Not one of the
three hundred students who listened to his lecture saw any change in
his manner and appearance, or could have guessed that the austere
gentleman in front of them had found out at last how hard it is to rise
above one's humanity.  The lecture over, he performed his routine
duties in the laboratory, and then drove back to his own house.  He did
not enter by the front door, but passed through the garden to the
folding glass casement which led out of the morning-room.  As he
approached he heard his wife's voice and O'Brien's in loud and animated
talk.  He paused among the rose-bushes, uncertain whether to interrupt
them or no.  Nothing was further from his nature than play the
eavesdropper; but as he stood, still hesitating, words fell upon his
ear which struck him rigid and motionless.
