‘There was a time when I was called plump Reuben,’ quoth my friend, as
we rode together up the winding track. ‘What with too little that is
solid and too much that is liquid I am like to be skeleton Reuben ere I
see Havant again. I am as full of rain-water as my father’s casks are of
October. I would, Micah, that you would wring me out and hang me to dry
upon one of these bushes.’ ‘If we are wet, King James’s men must be wetter,’ said I, ‘for at least
we have had such shelter as there was.’
