The atmosphere of the room was of a horrible and depressing stuffiness.
The servant who had first entered had thrown up the window, or it would
have been even more intolerable. This might partly be due to the fact
that a lamp stood flaring and smoking on the centre table. Beside it
sat the dead man, leaning back in his chair, his thin beard projecting,
his spectacles pushed up on to his forehead, and his lean dark face
turned towards the window and twisted into the same distortion of
terror which had marked the features of his dead sister. His limbs were
convulsed and his fingers contorted as though he had died in a very
paroxysm of fear. He was fully clothed, though there were signs that
his dressing had been done in a hurry. We had already learned that his
bed had been slept in, and that the tragic end had come to him in the
early morning.
