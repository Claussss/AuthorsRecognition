Oh, crowning infamy! Was there no limit to these degradations? He was no
longer even to choose his own pace. Since he had chosen to gallop so far
at his own will he must now gallop farther still at the will of another.
A spur struck home on either flank. A stinging whip-lash fell across his
shoulder. He bounded his own height in the air at the pain and the shame
of it. Then, forgetting his weary limbs, forgetting his panting, reeking
sides, forgetting everything save this intolerable insult and the
burning spirit within, he plunged off once more upon his furious gallop.
He was out on the heather slopes again and heading for Weydown Common.
On he flew and on. But again his brain failed him and again his limbs
trembled beneath him, and yet again he strove to ease his pace, only to
be driven onward by the cruel spur and the falling lash. He was blind
and giddy with fatigue.
