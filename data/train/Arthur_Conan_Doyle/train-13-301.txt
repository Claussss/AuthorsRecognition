      you will get food and drink. I have no doubt that I shall find
      you a situation.’       “‘Thank you, sir,’ said the seaman, touching his forelock. ‘I’m
      just off a two-yearer in an eight-knot tramp, short-handed at
      that, and I wants a rest. I thought I’d get it either with Mr.
      Beddoes or with you.’
