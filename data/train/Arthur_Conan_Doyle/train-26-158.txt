It must be confessed that Marbot's details are occasionally a little
hard to believe. Never in the pages of Lever has there been such a
series of hairbreadth escapes and dare-devil exploits. Surely he
stretched it a little sometimes. You may remember his adventure at
Eylau--I think it was Eylau--how a cannon-ball, striking the top of
his helmet, paralyzed him by the concussion of his spine; and how,
on a Russian officer running forward to cut him down, his horse bit
the man's face nearly off. This was the famous charger which savaged
everything until Marbot, having bought it for next to nothing, cured
it by thrusting a boiling leg of mutton into its mouth when it tried
to bite him. It certainly does need a robust faith to get over these
incidents. And yet, when one reflects upon the hundreds of battles
and skirmishes which a Napoleonic officer must have endured--how
they must have been the uninterrupted routine of his life from the
first dark hair upon his lip to the first grey one upon his head,
it is presumptuous to say what may or may not have been possible in
such unparalleled careers. At any rate, be it fact or fiction--fact
it is, in my opinion, with some artistic touching up of the high
lights--there are few books which I could not spare from my shelves
better than the memoirs of the gallant Marbot.
