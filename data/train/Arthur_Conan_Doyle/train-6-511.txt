The little skiff was swiftly lowered over the side and the slack end of
the cable fastened to the after thwart. Cock Badding and his comrades
pulled as if they would snap their oars, and the little vessel began
slowly to lurch forward over the rollers. But the next moment a larger
skiff had splashed over the side of the Frenchman, and no less than four
seamen were hard at work under her bows. If the Marie Rose advanced a
yard the Frenchman was going two. Again Cock Badding raved and shook his
fist. He clambered aboard, his face wet with sweat and dark with anger.
