      Once, I remember, as we passed over the Gemmi, and walked along
      the border of the melancholy Daubensee, a large rock which had
      been dislodged from the ridge upon our right clattered down and
      roared into the lake behind us. In an instant Holmes had raced up
      on to the ridge, and, standing upon a lofty pinnacle, craned his
      neck in every direction. It was in vain that our guide assured
      him that a fall of stones was a common chance in the spring-time
      at that spot. He said nothing, but he smiled at me with the air
      of a man who sees the fulfillment of that which he had expected.
