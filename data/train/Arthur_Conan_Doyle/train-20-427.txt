      “Well, Watson, what do you think of it?” asked Holmes, as we
      travelled back next morning.       “I can see that you are not satisfied.”       “Oh, yes, my dear Watson, I am perfectly satisfied. At the same
      time, Stanley Hopkins’s methods do not commend themselves to me.
      I am disappointed in Stanley Hopkins. I had hoped for better
      things from him. One should always look for a possible
      alternative, and provide against it. It is the first rule of
      criminal investigation.”
