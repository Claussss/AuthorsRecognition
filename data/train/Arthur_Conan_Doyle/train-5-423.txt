"You fool!" he hissed.  "You'll  be  sorry." "Very likely," cried the other.  "Mind what I say.  It's off!  I won't
hear of it!" "You've promised, anyhow." "Oh, I'll keep that!  I won't speak.  But I'd rather little Eva was in
her grave.  Once for all, it's off.  She'll do what I say.  We don't
want to see you again." So much Smith could not avoid hearing, but he hurried on, for he had no
wish to be involved in their dispute.  There had been a serious breach
between them, that was clear enough, and Lee was going to cause the
engagement with his sister to be broken off.  Smith thought of Hastie's
comparison of the toad and the dove, and was glad to think that the
matter was at an end.  Bellingham's face when he was in a passion was
not pleasant to look upon.  He was not a man to whom an innocent girl
could be trusted for life.  As he walked, Smith wondered languidly what
could have caused the quarrel, and what the promise might be which
Bellingham had been so anxious that Monkhouse Lee should keep.
