      “That is the problem which we have to solve,” Holmes answered,
      “and for my part I shall set about it by presuming that my
      reasoning is correct, and that a double murder has been
      committed. One of these ears is a woman’s, small, finely formed,
      and pierced for an earring. The other is a man’s, sun-burned,
      discoloured, and also pierced for an earring. These two people
      are presumably dead, or we should have heard their story before
      now. To-day is Friday. The packet was posted on Thursday morning.
      The tragedy, then, occurred on Wednesday or Tuesday or earlier.
      If the two people were murdered, who but their murderer would
      have sent this sign of his work to Miss Cushing? We may take it
      that the sender of the packet is the man whom we want. But he
      must have some strong reason for sending Miss Cushing this
      packet. What reason then? It must have been to tell her that the
      deed was done! or to pain her, perhaps. But in that case she
      knows who it is. Does she know? I doubt it. If she knew, why
      should she call the police in? She might have buried the ears,
      and no one would have been the wiser. That is what she would have
      done if she had wished to shield the criminal. But if she does
      not wish to shield him she would give his name. There is a tangle
      here which needs straightening out.” He had been talking in a
      high, quick voice, staring blankly up over the garden fence, but
      now he sprang briskly to his feet and walked towards the house.
