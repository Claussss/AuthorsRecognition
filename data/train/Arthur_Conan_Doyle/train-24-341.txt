or in cell this day you could not have taught a wayward maiden to abide
by the truth. Is it not so? What avail is the shepherd if he leaves his
sheep.” “A sorry shepherd!” said Alleyne humbly. “But here is your noble
father.” “And you shall see how worthy a pupil I am. Father, I am much beholden
to this young clerk, who was of service to me and helped me this very
morning in Minstead Woods, four miles to the north of the Christchurch
road, where I had no call to be, you having ordered it otherwise.” All
this she reeled off in a loud voice, and then glanced with sidelong,
questioning eyes at Alleyne for his approval.
