      could not stay away longer. It is so lonely up there with
      only—Oh, my God, it is Paul!’       “These last words were in Greek, and at the same instant the man
      with a convulsive effort tore the plaster from his lips, and
      screaming out ‘Sophy! Sophy!’ rushed into the woman’s arms. Their
      embrace was but for an instant, however, for the younger man
      seized the woman and pushed her out of the room, while the elder
      easily overpowered his emaciated victim, and dragged him away
      through the other door. For a moment I was left alone in the
      room, and I sprang to my feet with some vague idea that I might
      in some way get a clue to what this house was in which I found
      myself. Fortunately, however, I took no steps, for looking up I
      saw that the older man was standing in the doorway with his eyes
      fixed upon me.
