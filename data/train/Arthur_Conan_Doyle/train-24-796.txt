“Who is this, then?” asked Sir Nigel. Alleyne was about to explain, when a fresh roar from the stranger
interrupted him. “Thou villain inn-keeper,” he shouted, “did I not ask you when I brought
my lady here whether your inn was clean?” “You did, sire.” “Did I not very particularly ask you whether there were any vermin in
it?” “You did, sire.” “And you answered me?” “That there were not, sire.” “And yet ere I have been here an hour I find Englishmen crawling about
within it. Where are we to be free from this pestilent race? Can a
Frenchman upon French land not sit down in a French auberge without
having his ears pained by the clack of their hideous talk? Send them
packing, inn-keeper, or it may be the worse for them and for you.”
