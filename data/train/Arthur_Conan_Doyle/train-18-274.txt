Captain Meadows, I must bid you adieu, thanking you for your kindness

your own before the year is out. I trust, Mr. West, that I may see you
again before I leave this part of the country. Farewell!” He raised his red fez, inclined his noble head with the stately grace
which characterised all his actions, and strode away in the direction
from which he had come.
