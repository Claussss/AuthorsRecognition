“In what shape then did Satan appear?” the Abbot demanded. “As a great yellow horse, holy father--a monster horse, with eyes of
fire and the teeth of a griffin.” “A yellow horse!” The sacrist glared at the scared monk. “You foolish
brother! How will you behave when you have indeed to face the King of
Terrors himself if you can be so frightened by the sight of a yellow
horse? It is the horse of Franklin Aylward, my father, which has been
distrained by us because he owes the Abbey fifty good shillings and can
never hope to pay it. Such a horse, they say, is not to be found betwixt
this and the King's stables at Windsor, for his sire was a Spanish
destrier, and his dam an Arab mare of the very breed which Saladin,
whose soul now reeks in Hell, kept for his own use, and even it has been
said under the shelter of his own tent. I took him in discharge of the
debt, and I ordered the varlets who had haltered him to leave him alone
in the water-meadow, for I have heard that the beast has indeed a most
evil spirit, and has killed more men than one.”
