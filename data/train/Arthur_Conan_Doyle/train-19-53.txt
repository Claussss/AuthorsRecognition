Well, the incident places me in a most unfortunate position.  On the
one hand, I am very loath to abandon a series of experiments which have
already gone so far, and which promise such brilliant results.  On the
other, if this unhappy woman has conceived a passion for me----  But
surely even now I must have made some hideous mistake.  She, with her
age and her deformity!  It is impossible.  And then she knew about
Agatha.  She understood how I was placed.  She only smiled out of
amusement, perhaps, when in my dazed state I seized her hand.  It was
my half-mesmerized brain which gave it a meaning, and sprang with such
bestial swiftness to meet it.  I wish I could persuade myself that it
was indeed so.  On the whole, perhaps, my wisest plan would be to
postpone our other experiments until Wilson's return.  I have written a
note to Miss Penclosa, therefore, making no allusion to last night, but
saying that a press of work would cause me to interrupt our sittings
for a few days.  She has answered, formally enough, to say that if I
should change my mind I should find her at home at the usual hour.
