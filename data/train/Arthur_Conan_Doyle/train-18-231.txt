There was just light enough to make out the scudding clouds and the
white gleam of the breakers, but beyond that all was absolute darkness. We stood ankle deep in the shingle and seaweed, shading our eyes with
our hands and peering out into the inky obscurity. It seemed to me as I listened that I could hear human voices loud
in intreaty and terror, but amid the wild turmoil of Nature it was
difficult to distinguish one sound from another.
