“Welcome!” cried Edward. “Welcome to our worthy and faithful Seneschal
of Calais! Come, sit here before me at the board, for I have sent for
you that I may hear your news from over the sea, and thank you for
the care that you have taken of that which is as dear to me as wife or
child. Set a place for Sir Aymery there, and give him food and drink,
for he has ridden fast and far in our service to-day.”
