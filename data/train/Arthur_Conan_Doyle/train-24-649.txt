further end of the room, “what was this great battle about?” “Why, you jack-fool, what would it be about save who should wear the
crown of France?” “I thought that mayhap it might be as to who should have this
feather-bed of thine.” “If I come down to you, Silas, I may lay my belt across your shoulders,”
 Aylward answered, amid a general shout of laughter. “But it is time
young chickens went to roost when they dare cackle against their elders.
It is late, Simon.”
