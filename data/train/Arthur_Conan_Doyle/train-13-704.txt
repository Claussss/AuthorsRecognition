      “I’ve heard of your methods before now, Mr. Holmes,” said he,
      tartly. “You are ready enough to use all the information that the
      police can lay at your disposal, and then you try to finish the
      case yourself and bring discredit on them.”       “On the contrary,” said Holmes, “out of my last fifty-three cases
      my name has only appeared in four, and the police have had all
      the credit in forty-nine. I don’t blame you for not knowing this,
      for you are young and inexperienced, but if you wish to get on in
      your new duties you will work with me and not against me.”
