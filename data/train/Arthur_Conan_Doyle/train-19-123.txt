"Well, Professor Gilroy--or is it Mr. Gilroy?" said she, with that
bitter smile of hers.  "How is your friend Mr. Charles Sadler after the
ball?" "You fiend!" I cried.  "You have come to the end of your tricks now.  I
will have no more of them.  Listen to what I say."  I strode across and
shook her roughly by the shoulder "As sure as there is a God in heaven,
I swear that if you try another of your deviltries upon me I will have
your life for it.  Come what may, I will have your life.  I have come
to the end of what a man can endure."
