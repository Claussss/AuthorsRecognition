velvet, ‘hath studied the art of war among the Muscovites, in their
barbarous and bloody encounters with the Turks. God forbid that we

idolaters of a savage country.’ ‘Sir William would like to see war carried out on truly courteous
principles,’ said the first speaker. ‘A battle should be like a stately
minuet, with no loss of dignity or of etiquette.’
