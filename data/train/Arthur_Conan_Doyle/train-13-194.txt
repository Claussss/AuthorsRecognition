      â€œIt was all still and quiet upon the ground floor. In the kitchen
      a kettle was singing on the fire, and a large black cat lay
      coiled up in the basket; but there was no sign of the woman whom
      I had seen before. I ran into the other room, but it was equally
      deserted. Then I rushed up the stairs, only to find two other
      rooms empty and deserted at the top. There was no one at all in
      the whole house. The furniture and pictures were of the most
      common and vulgar description, save in the one chamber at the
      window of which I had seen the strange face. That was comfortable
      and elegant, and all my suspicions rose into a fierce bitter
      flame when I saw that on the mantelpiece stood a copy of a
      full-length photograph of my wife, which had been taken at my
      request only three months ago.
