Swinging their mighty weapon, the storming party thudded and crashed
upon the gate, every blow loosening and widening the cracks which rent
it from end to end. The three knights, with Nigel, the Frenchman Raoul
and the other squires, stood beside the ram, cheering on the men, and
chanting to the rhythm of the swing with a loud “Ha!” at every blow. A
great stone loosened from the parapet roared through the air and
struck Sir James Astley and another of the attackers, but Nigel and the
Frenchman had taken their places in an instant, and the ram thudded and
smashed with greater energy than ever. Another blow and another! the
lower part was staving inward, but the great central bar still held
firm. Surely another minute would beat it from its sockets.
