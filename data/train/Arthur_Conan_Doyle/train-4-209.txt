‘Here comes some one who is not afraid to gallop,’ I remarked. ‘Halt here in the shadow!’ cried Saxon, in a short, quick whisper. ‘Have
your blade loose in the scabbard. He must have a set errand who rides so
fast o’ nights.’ Looking down the road we could make out through the darkness a shadowy
blur which soon resolved itself into man and horse. The rider was
well-nigh abreast of us before he was aware of our presence, when he
pulled up his steed in a strange, awkward fashion, and faced round in
our direction.
