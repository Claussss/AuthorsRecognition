“And how would they bring about our destruction, Mr. Standback?” cried
McGinty. “Is it by the police? Sure, half of them are in our pay and
half of them afraid of us. Or is it by the law courts and the judge?
Haven't we tried that before now, and what ever came of it?” “There is a Judge Lynch that might try the case,” said Brother Morris. A general shout of anger greeted the suggestion. “I have but to raise my finger,” cried McGinty, “and I could put two
hundred men into this town that would clear it out from end to end.”
 Then suddenly raising his voice and bending his huge black brows into
a terrible frown, “See here, Brother Morris, I have my eye on you, and
have had for some time! You've no heart yourself, and you try to take
the heart out of others. It will be an ill day for you, Brother Morris,
when your own name comes on our agenda paper, and I'm thinking that it's
just there that I ought to place it.”
