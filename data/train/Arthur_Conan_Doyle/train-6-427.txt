“What how, Nigel!” he cried. “Mary has told me that you make a start
this morning, and we have waited here this hour and more on the chance
of seeing you pass. Come, lad, and have a last stoup of English ale, for
many a time amid the sour French wines you will long for the white foam
under your nose, and the good homely twang of it.” Nigel had to decline the draft, for it meant riding into Guildford town,
a mile out of his course, but very gladly he agreed with Mary that
they should climb the path to the old shrine and offer a last orison
together. The knight and Aylward waited below with the horses; and so it
came about that Nigel and Mary found themselves alone under the solemn
old Gothic arches, in front of the dark shadowed recess in which gleamed
the golden reliquary of the saint. In silence they knelt side by side
in prayer, and then came forth once more out of the gloom and the shadow
into the fresh sunlit summer morning. They stopped ere they descended
the path, and looked to right and left at the fair meadows and the blue
Wey curling down the valley.
