      “Well, I’ll come out by the same train to-morrow, though it’s
      more than likely that my report will be a negative one.”       “God bless you for promising to come,” cried our client. “It
      gives me fresh life to know that something is being done. By the
      way, I have had a letter from Lord Holdhurst.”       “Ha! What did he say?”       “He was cold, but not harsh. I daresay my severe illness
      prevented him from being that. He repeated that the matter was of
      the utmost importance, and added that no steps would be taken
      about my future—by which he means, of course, my dismissal—until
      my health was restored and I had an opportunity of repairing my
      misfortune.”
