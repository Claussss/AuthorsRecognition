In the case of the direct voice one of the leading exponents is Mrs.
French, an amateur medium in America, whose work is described both by
Mr. Funk and Mr. Randall.  She is a frail elderly lady, yet in her
presence the most masculine and robust voices make communications, even
when her own mouth is covered.  I have myself investigated the direct
voice in the case of four different mediums, two of them amateurs, and
can have no doubt of the reality of the voices, and that they are not
the effect of ventriloquism.  I was more struck by the failures than by
the successes, and cannot easily forget the passionate pantings with
which some entity strove hard to reveal his identity to me, but without
success.  One of these mediums was tested afterwards by having the
mouth filled with coloured water, but the voice continued as before.
