Which are the great short stories of the English language? Not a
bad basis for a debate! This I am sure of: that there are far fewer
supremely good short stories than there are supremely good long
books. It takes more exquisite skill to carve the cameo than the
statue. But the strangest thing is that the two excellences seem
to be separate and even antagonistic. Skill in the one by no means
ensures skill in the other. The great masters of our literature,
Fielding, Scott, Dickens, Thackeray, Reade, have left no single
short story of outstanding merit behind them, with the possible
exception of Wandering Willie's Tale in "Red Gauntlet." On the other
hand, men who have been very great in the short story, Stevenson,
Poe, and Bret Harte, have written no great book. The champion
sprinter is seldom a five-miler as well.
