It is this wonderful life, its example and inspiration, which was the
real object of the descent of this high spirit on to our planet.  If
the human race had earnestly centred upon that instead of losing itself
in vain dreams of vicarious sacrifices and imaginary falls, with all
the mystical and contentious philosophy which has centred round the
subject, how very different the level of human culture and happiness
would be to-day!  Such theories, with their absolute want of reason or
morality, have been the main cause why the best minds have been so
often alienated from the Christian system and proclaimed themselves
materialists.  In contemplating what shocked their instincts for truth
they have lost that which was both true and beautiful.  Christ's death
was worthy of His life, and rounded off a perfect career, but it is the
life which He has left as the foundation for the permanent religion of
mankind.  All the religious wars, the private feuds, and the countless
miseries of sectarian contention, would have been at least minimised,
if not avoided, had the bare example of Christ's life been adopted as
the standard of conduct and of religion.
