At this simple and kindly speech a flush of devotion, mingled in my
own case at least with a heart-whole pity for the poor, weak gentleman,
swept over us. We pressed round him with our hands upon the hilts of our
swords, swearing that we would stand by him, though all the world stood
between him and his rights. Even the rigid and impassive Puritans were
moved to a show of loyalty; while the courtiers, carried away by zeal,
drew their rapiers and shouted until the crowd beneath caught the
enthusiasm, and the air was full of the cheering. The light returned
to Monmouthâ€™s eye and the colour to his cheek as he listened to the
clamour. For a moment at least he looked like the King which he aspired
to be.
