And the most dreadful part of it all is my own loneliness.  Here I sit
in a commonplace English bow-window, looking out upon a commonplace
English street with its garish 'buses and its lounging policeman, and
behind me there hangs a shadow which is out of all keeping with the age
and place.  In the home of knowledge I am weighed down and tortured by
a power of which science knows nothing.  No magistrate would listen to
me.  No paper would discuss my case.  No doctor would believe my
symptoms.  My own most intimate friends would only look upon it as a
sign of brain derangement.  I am out of all touch with my kind.  Oh,
that devilish woman!  Let her have a care!  She may push me too far.
When the law cannot help a man, he may make a law for himself.
