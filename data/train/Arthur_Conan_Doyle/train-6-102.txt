Nigel stooped over her and kissed her brow. “Your words will ever be as
a star upon my path,” said he. Then, carrying over the small table and
the chessmen, he proposed that they should play their usual game before
they sought their rooms for the night. But a sudden and rude interruption broke in upon their gentle contest.

And then there came a sharp clash of arms, a dull heavy blow as from
a club or sword-pommel, and a deep voice from without summoned them to
open in the King's name. The old dame and Nigel had both sprung to their
feet, their table overturned and their chessmen scattered among the
rushes. Nigel's hand had sought his crossbow, but the Lady Ermyntrude
grasped his arm.
