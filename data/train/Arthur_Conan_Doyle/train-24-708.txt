“By Saint Paul!” he cried, as Alleyne entered, “you are the man who will
stand by me in this matter. I have been in sore need of you, Alleyne.” “God be with you, my fair lord!” the squire answered. “I trust that you
have taken no hurt from all that you have gone through yesterday.” “Nay; I feel the fresher for it, Alleyne. It has eased my joints, which
were somewhat stiff from these years of peace. I trust, Alleyne, that
thou didst very carefully note and mark the bearing and carriage of
this knight of France; for it is time, now when you are young, that you
should see all that is best, and mould your own actions in accordance.
This was a man from whom much honor might be gained, and I have seldom
met any one for whom I have conceived so much love and esteem. Could
I but learn his name, I should send you to him with my cartel, that we
might have further occasion to watch his goodly feats of arms.”
