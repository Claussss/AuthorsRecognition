kill you. Come, for the Virgin's sake, or for my sake, for I cannot go
and leave you here.” “Come, then,” said he; and they ran together to the cover of the woods.

his hair and his beard. He held something which flashed in his right
hand, and he stooped at the threshold to unloose the black hound.
