“They didn't,” said the captain. “Indeed they did, and if I did not tell you sooner it was because
you were always ready to laugh at what I said about them. They had
instruments o' their own--when they used them I can't say--but every day
at noon they worked out the latitude and longitude, and marked out the
vessel's position on a chart that was pinned on their cabin table. I saw
them at it, and so did the steward from his pantry.”
