I handed him the glass, and he drank it down. “That’s better,” he said. “Well, I waited for a quarter of an hour, or

whom was Drebber, and the other was a young chap whom I had never seen

the head of the steps he gave him a shove and a kick which sent him half
across the road. ‘You hound,’ he cried, shaking his stick at him; ‘I’ll
teach you to insult an honest girl!’ He was so hot that I think he would
have thrashed Drebber with his cudgel, only that the cur staggered away

corner, and then, seeing my cab, he hailed me and jumped in. ‘Drive me
to Halliday’s Private Hotel,’ said he.
