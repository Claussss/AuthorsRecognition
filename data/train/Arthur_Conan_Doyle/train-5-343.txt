"My dear Clara, how you do croak!" "Oh! I don't wish to do that, Charles.  But you remember what happened
to Lord Bellamy's child.  She was just Ida's age.  That was another
case in which Sir William's advice was disregarded." Lord Charles groaned impatiently. "I have not disregarded it," said he. "No, no, of course not.  I know your strong sense, and your good heart
too well, dear.  You were very wisely looking at both sides of the
question.  That is what we poor women cannot do.  It is emotion against
reason, as I have often heard you say.  We are swayed this way and
that, but you men are persistent, and so you gain your way with us.
But I am so pleased that you have decided for Tangier."
