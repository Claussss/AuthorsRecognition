Two of the bravest champions whom Spiritualism has ever produced, the
late W. T. Stead and the late Archdeacon Colley--names which will bulk
large in days to come--attached great importance to spirit photography
as a final and incontestable proof of survival.  In his recent work,
"Proofs of the Truth of Spiritualism" (Kegan Paul), the eminent
botanist, Professor Henslow, has given one case which would really
appear to be above criticism.  He narrates how the inquirer subjected a
sealed packet of plates to the Crewe circle without exposure,
endeavoring to get a psychograph.  Upon being asked on which plate he
desired it, he said "the fifth."  Upon this plate being developed,
there was found on it a copy of a passage from the Codex Alexandrinus
of the New Testament in the British Museum.  Reproductions, both of the
original and of the copy, will be found in Professor Henslow's book.
