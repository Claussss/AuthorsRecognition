I made the promise to allay my sister's apprehensions, but in the bright
sunlight of morning it appeared less than absurd to imagine that our
poor vegetarian castaways could have any sinister intentions, or that
their advent could have any effect upon the tenant of Cloomber. I was anxious, myself, however, to see whether I could see anything of
the Heatherstones, so after breakfast I walked up to the Hall. In their
seclusion it was impossible for them to have learnt anything of the
recent events. I felt, therefore, that even if I should meet the general
he could hardly regard me as an intruder while I had so much news to
communicate.
