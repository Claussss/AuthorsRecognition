My neighbor, Charles Sadler, the handsome young demonstrator of
anatomy, came in this evening to return a volume of Virchow's
"Archives" which I had lent him.  I call him young, but, as a matter of
fact, he is a year older than I am. "I understand, Gilroy," said he, "that you are being experimented upon
by Miss Penclosa." "Well," he went on, when I had acknowledged it, "if I were you, I
should not let it go any further.  You will think me very impertinent,
no doubt, but, none the less, I feel it to be my duty to advise you to
have no more to do with her."
