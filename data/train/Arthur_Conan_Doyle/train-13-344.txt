      “There are cases enough here, Watson,” said he, looking at me
      with mischievous eyes. “I think that if you knew all that I had
      in this box you would ask me to pull some out instead of putting
      others in.”       “These are the records of your early work, then?” I asked. “I
      have often wished that I had notes of those cases.”       “Yes, my boy, these were all done prematurely before my
      biographer had come to glorify me.” He lifted bundle after bundle
      in a tender, caressing sort of way. “They are not all successes,
      Watson,” said he. “But there are some pretty little problems
      among them. Here’s the record of the Tarleton murders, and the
      case of Vamberry, the wine merchant, and the adventure of the old
      Russian woman, and the singular affair of the aluminium crutch,
      as well as a full account of Ricoletti of the club-foot, and his
      abominable wife. And here—ah, now, this really is something a
      little _recherché_.”
