      “‘The partitions between the cells of the convicts, instead of
      being of thick oak, as is usual in convict-ships, were quite thin
      and frail. The man next to me, upon the aft side, was one whom I
      had particularly noticed when we were led down the quay. He was a
      young man with a clear, hairless face, a long, thin nose, and
      rather nut-cracker jaws. He carried his head very jauntily in the
      air, had a swaggering style of walking, and was, above all else,
      remarkable for his extraordinary height. I don’t think any of our
      heads would have come up to his shoulder, and I am sure that he
      could not have measured less than six and a half feet. It was
      strange among so many sad and weary faces to see one which was
      full of energy and resolution. The sight of it was to me like a
      fire in a snowstorm. I was glad, then, to find that he was my
      neighbour, and gladder still when, in the dead of the night, I
      heard a whisper close to my ear, and found that he had managed to
      cut an opening in the board which separated us.
