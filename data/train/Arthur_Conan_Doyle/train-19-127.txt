5 P. M.  Now, let me try to be accurate.  Let me try to say exactly how
it occurred.  It is fresh in my mind, and I can set it down correctly,
though it is not likely that the time will ever come when I shall
forget the doings of to-day. I had returned from the Mardens' after lunch, and was cutting some
microscopic sections in my freezing microtome, when in an instant I
lost consciousness in the sudden hateful fashion which has become only
too familiar to me of late.
