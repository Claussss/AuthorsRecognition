No, I can look for no help from any human being.  If I consult any
more, they may put their heads together and I may find myself in an
asylum.  I can but grip my courage with both hands, and pray that an
honest man may not be abandoned. April 10.  It is the sweetest spring within the memory of man.  So
green, so mild, so beautiful! Ah, what a contrast between nature
without and my own soul so torn with doubt and terror!  It has been an
uneventful day, but I know that I am on the edge of an abyss.  I know
it, and yet I go on with the routine of my life.  The one bright spot
is that Agatha is happy and well and out of all danger.  If this
creature had a hand on each of us, what might she not do?
