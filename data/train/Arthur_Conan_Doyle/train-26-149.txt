He has, as you see, a goodly line of his brothers beside him. There
are the Italian ones, "Sandra Belloni," and "Vittoria"; there is
"Rhoda Fleming," which carried Stevenson off his critical feet;
"Beauchamp's Career," too, dealing with obsolete politics. No great
writer should spend himself upon a temporary theme. It is like the
beauty who is painted in some passing fashion of gown. She tends
to become obsolete along with her frame. Here also is the dainty
"Diana," the egoist with immortal Willoughby Pattern, eternal type
of masculine selfishness, and "Harry Richmond," the first chapters
of which are, in my opinion, among the finest pieces of narrative
prose in the language. That great mind would have worked in any form
which his age had favoured. He is a novelist by accident. As an
Elizabethan he would have been a great dramatist; under Queen Anne
a great essayist. But whatever medium he worked in, he must equally
have thrown the image of a great brain and a great soul.
