Such was the youth who, cracking his whip joyously, and followed by half
a score of dogs, cantered on his rude pony down the Tilford Lane, and
thence it was that with a smile of amused contempt upon his face
he observed the comedy in the field and the impotent efforts of the
servants of Waverley. Suddenly, however, as the comedy turned swiftly to black tragedy, this
passive spectator leaped into quick strenuous life. With a spring he
was off his pony, and with another he was over the stone wall and flying
swiftly across the field. Looking up from his victim, the great yellow
horse saw this other enemy approach, and spurning the prostrate, but
still writhing body with its heels, dashed at the newcomer.
