And then came the blessed change.  Never tell me that there is not a
Providence!  I was on the brink of perdition.  My feet were on the
edge.  Was it a coincidence that at that very instant help should come?
No, no, no; there is a Providence, and its hand has drawn me back.
There is something in the universe stronger than this devil woman with
her tricks.  Ah, what a balm to my heart it is to think so!
