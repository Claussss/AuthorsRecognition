      “Perhaps you would like me to stay there to-night?”       “I was just going to propose it.”       “Then, if my friend of the night comes to revisit me, he will
      find the bird flown. We are all in your hands, Mr. Holmes, and
      you must tell us exactly what you would like done. Perhaps you
      would prefer that Joseph came with us so as to look after me?”       “Oh, no; my friend Watson is a medical man, you know, and he’ll
      look after you. We’ll have our lunch here, if you will permit us,
      and then we shall all three set off for town together.”
