     Illustration: THE PEOPLE OF TURI'S CANOE, AFTER A VOYAGE OF GREAT
     HARDSHIP, AT LAST SIGHT THE SHORES OF NEW ZEALAND. From a painting
     in the Auckland Art Gallery by C. F. Goldie and L. J. Steele. In the public gallery of Auckland they have a duplicate of one of these
enormous canoes. It is 87 feet in length and the thwarts are broad
enough to hold three or four men. When it was filled with its hundred
warriors, with the chief standing in the centre to give time to the
rowers, it must, as it dashed through the waves, have been a truly
terrific object. I should think that it represented the supreme
achievement of neolithic man. There are a series of wonderful pictures
of Maori life in the same gallery by Goldie and Steele. Of these I
reproduce, by permission, one which represents the starving crew of one
canoe sighting the distant shore. The engraving only gives a faint
indication of the effect of the vividly-coloured original.
