      Our hope was that, by taking train, we might get to Beckenham as
      soon or sooner than the carriage. On reaching Scotland Yard,
      however, it was more than an hour before we could get Inspector
      Gregson and comply with the legal formalities which would enable
      us to enter the house. It was a quarter to ten before we reached
      London Bridge, and half past before the four of us alighted on
      the Beckenham platform. A drive of half a mile brought us to The
      Myrtlesâ€”a large, dark house standing back from the road in its
      own grounds. Here we dismissed our cab, and made our way up the
      drive together.
