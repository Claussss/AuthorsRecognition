I led the old seaman aside, and having thanked him for the kindness
which he had shown me, I spoke to him of the gauger, and implored him to
use his influence to save the man. ‘It rests with Captain Venables,’ said he gloomily. ‘If we let him go
what becomes of our cave?’ ‘Is there no way of insuring his silence?’ I asked. ‘Well, we might ship
him to the Plantations,’ said the mate. ‘We could take him to the Texel
with us, and get Captain Donders or some other to give him a lift across
the western ocean.’
