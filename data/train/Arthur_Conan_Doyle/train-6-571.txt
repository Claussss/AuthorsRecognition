XVI. HOW THE KING'S COURT FEASTED IN CALAIS CASTLE 
It was a bright sunshiny morning when Nigel found himself at last able
to leave his turret chamber and to walk upon the rampart of the castle.
There was a brisk northern wind, heavy and wet with the salt of the
sea, and he felt, as he turned his face to it, fresh life and strength
surging in his blood and bracing his limbs. He took his hand from
Aylward's supporting arm and stood with his cap off, leaning on the
rampart and breathing in the cool strong air. Far off upon the distant
sky-line, half hidden by the heave of the waves, was the low white
fringe of cliffs which skirted England. Between him and them lay the
broad blue Channel, seamed and flecked with flashing foam, for a sharp
sea was running and the few ships in sight were laboring heavily.
Nigel's eyes traversed the wide-spread view, rejoicing in the change
from the gray wall of his cramped chamber. Finally they settled upon a
strange object at his very feet.
