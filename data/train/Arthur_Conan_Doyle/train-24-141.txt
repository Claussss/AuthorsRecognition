that thou shouldst stare so?” “I never have,” said Alleyne frankly, “though I have oft heard talk of
their deeds.” “By my hilt!” cried the other, “if you were to cross the narrow sea you
would find them as thick as bees at a tee-hole. Couldst not shoot a
bolt down any street of Bordeaux, I warrant, but you would pink archer,
squire, or knight. There are more breastplates than gaberdines to be
seen, I promise you.”
