      “And the other points?”       “He has been in the habit of lighting his pipe at lamps and
      gas-jets. You can see that it is quite charred all down one side.
      Of course a match could not have done that. Why should a man hold
      a match to the side of his pipe? But you cannot light it at a
      lamp without getting the bowl charred. And it is all on the right
      side of the pipe. From that I gather that he is a left-handed
      man. You hold your own pipe to the lamp, and see how naturally
      you, being right-handed, hold the left side to the flame. You
      might do it once the other way, but not as a constancy. This has
      always been held so. Then he has bitten through his amber. It
      takes a muscular, energetic fellow, and one with a good set of
      teeth, to do that. But if I am not mistaken I hear him upon the
      stair, so we shall have something more interesting than his pipe
      to study.”
