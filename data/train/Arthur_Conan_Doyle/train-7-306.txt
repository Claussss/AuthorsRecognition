There was a black, bulging ridge like a bastion upon the right side of
the terrible khor up which the camels were winding. At one point it rose
into a small pinnacle. On this pinnacle stood a solitary, motionless
figure clad entirely in black, save for a brilliant dash of scarlet upon
his head. There could not surely be two such short, sturdy figures or
such large, colourless faces in the Libyan desert. His shoulders were
stooping forward, and he seemed to be staring intently down into
the ravine. His pose and outline were like a caricature of the great
Napoleon.
