"No, thank you.  I want you to come with me, Hastie, and do what I ask
you." "Certainly, my boy." "And bring a heavy stick with you." "Hullo!" Hastie stared.  "Here's a hunting-crop that would fell an ox." "One other thing.  You have a box of amputating knives.  Give me the
longest of them." "There you are.  You seem to be fairly on the war trail.  Anything
else?" "No; that will do." Smith placed the knife inside his coat, and led the
way to the quadrangle.  "We are neither of us chickens, Hastie," said
he.  "I think I can do this job alone, but I take you as a precaution.
I am going to have a little talk with Bellingham.  If I have only him
to deal with, I won't, of course, need you.  If I shout, however, up
you come, and lam out with your whip as hard as you can lick.  Do you
understand?"
