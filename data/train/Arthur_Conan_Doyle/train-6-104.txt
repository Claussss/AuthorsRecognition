“I call on Nigel Loring!” he cried. “I, the officer of the King's law
and the lay summoner of Waverley, call upon the man named Nigel Loring!” “Yes, it is he!” cried the sacrist. “Archers, do as you were ordered!” In an instant the band threw themselves upon him like the hounds on a
stag. Desperately Nigel strove to gain his sword which lay upon the iron
coffer. With the convulsive strength which comes from the spirit rather
than from the body, he bore them all in that direction, but the sacrist
snatched the weapon from its place, and the rest dragged the writhing
Squire to the ground and swathed him in a cord.
