"There's some fellow gone in or out of your room," he remarked. Bellingham sprang up and stood helpless for a moment, with the
expression of a man who is half incredulous and half afraid. "I surely locked it.  I am almost positive that I locked it," he
stammered.  "No one could have opened it." "Why, I hear someone coming up the steps now," said Smith. Bellingham rushed out through the door, slammed it loudly behind him,
and hurried down the stairs.  About half-way down Smith heard him stop,
and thought he caught the sound of whispering.  A moment later the door
beneath him shut, a key creaked in a lock, and Bellingham, with beads
of moisture upon his pale face, ascended the stairs once more, and
re-entered the room.
