A moment later Nigel's sword and Badding's hammer had each claimed a
victim and driven back the rush of assailants. The five were safe upon
the deck, but it was hard for them to keep a footing there. The French
seamen, Bretons and Normans, were stout, powerful fellows, armed with
axes and swords, fierce fighters and brave men. They swarmed round
the little band, attacking them from all sides. Black Simon felled the
black-bearded French Captain, and at the same instant was cut over the
head and lay with his scalp open upon the deck. The seaman Wat of Hythe
was killed by a crashing blow from an ax. Nigel was struck down, but
was up again like a flash, and drove his sword through the man who had
felled him.
