      â€œHunter waited until his fellow-grooms had returned, when he sent
      a message to the trainer and told him what had occurred. Straker
      was excited at hearing the account, although he does not seem to
      have quite realized its true significance. It left him, however,
      vaguely uneasy, and Mrs. Straker, waking at one in the morning,
      found that he was dressing. In reply to her inquiries, he said
      that he could not sleep on account of his anxiety about the
      horses, and that he intended to walk down to the stables to see
      that all was well. She begged him to remain at home, as she could
      hear the rain pattering against the window, but in spite of her
      entreaties he pulled on his large mackintosh and left the house.
