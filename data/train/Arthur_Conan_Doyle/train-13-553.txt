      Sherlock Holmes had listened to this long narrative with an
      intentness which showed me that his interest was keenly aroused.
      His face was as impassive as ever, but his lids had drooped more
      heavily over his eyes, and his smoke had curled up more thickly
      from his pipe to emphasize each curious episode in the doctor’s
      tale. As our visitor concluded, Holmes sprang up without a word,
      handed me my hat, picked his own from the table, and followed Dr.
      Trevelyan to the door. Within a quarter of an hour we had been
      dropped at the door of the physician’s residence in Brook Street,
      one of those sombre, flat-faced houses which one associates with
      a West-End practice. A small page admitted us, and we began at
      once to ascend the broad, well-carpeted stair.
