While he spoke the young Squire had climbed on to the top of the
wall and stood there balanced, the very image of grace and spirit and
gallantry, his bridle hanging from one hand and his whip grasped in the
other. With a fierce snort, the horse made for him instantly, and his
white teeth flashed as he snapped; but again a heavy blow from the
loaded whip caused him to swerve, and even at the instant of the swerve,
measuring the distance with steady eyes, and bending his supple body for
the spring, Nigel bounded into the air and fell with his legs astride
the broad back of the yellow horse. For a minute, with neither saddle
nor stirrups to help him, and the beast ramping and rearing like a mad
thing beneath him, he was hard pressed to hold his own. His legs were
like two bands of steel welded on to the swelling arches of the great
horse's ribs, and his left hand was buried deep in the tawny mane.
