A great centre of proof and of inspiration lay during those early days
in Mr. D. D. Home, a Scottish-American, who possessed powers which make
him one of the most remarkable personalities of whom we have any
record.  Home's life, written by his second wife, is a book which
deserves very careful reading.  This man, who in some aspects was more
than a man, was before the public for nearly thirty years.  During that
time he never received payment for his services, and was always ready,
to put himself at the disposal of any bona-fide and reasonable
enquirer.  His phenomena were produced in full light, and it was
immaterial to him whether the sittings were in his own rooms or in
those of his friends.  So high were his principles that upon one
occasion, though he was a man of moderate means and less than moderate
health, he refused the princely fee of two thousand pounds offered for
a single sitting by the Union Circle in Paris.
