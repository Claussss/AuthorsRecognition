“It is no less than a feather-bed, fair sir, which he bears upon his
back, for I would fain bring it to Tilford, and yet it is overlarge for
me when I take my place with my fellows in the ranks. But indeed this
war has been a most excellent one, and I have already sent half a
wagonload of my gear back to Bordeaux to await my homecoming. Yet I have
my fears when I think of all the rascal foot-archers who are waiting
there, for some folk have no grace or honesty in their souls, and cannot
keep their hands from that which belongs to another. But if I may throw
my leg over yonder spare horse I will come on with you, fair sir, for
indeed it would be joy to my heart to know that I was riding under your
banner once again.”
