Such were the bitter words of Knolles, the more bitter because Nigel
felt in his heart that he had indeed done wrong, and that Chandos would
have said the same though, perchance, in kinder words. He listened in
silent respect, as his duty was, and then having saluted his leader
he withdrew apart, threw himself down amongst the bushes, and wept the
hottest tears of his life, sobbing bitterly with his face between his
hands. He had striven hard, and yet everything had gone wrong with him.
He was bruised, burned and aching from head to foot. Yet so high is the
spirit above the body that all was nothing compared to the sorrow and
shame which racked his soul.
