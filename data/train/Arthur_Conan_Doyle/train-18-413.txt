“You dog,” I said in Hindustani. “What do you mean by letting people
disturb me in this way?” The man stared at me in amazement. “Has any one disturbed the sahib?” he
asked. “This instant--this moment. You must have seen him pass out of my tent.” “Surely the Burra Sahib is mistaken,” the man answered, respectfully but
firmly. “I have been here for an hour, and no one has passed from the
tent.” Puzzled and disconcerted, I was sitting by the side of my couch
wondering whether the whole thing were a delusion, brought on by the
nervous excitement of our skirmish, when a new marvel overtook me. From
over my head there suddenly sounded a sharp, tinkling sound, like that
produced by an empty glass when flipped by the nail, only louder and
more intense.
