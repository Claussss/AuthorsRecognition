But what was this new outrage which had been inflicted upon it? What was
this defiling bar of iron which was locked hard against its mouth? What
were these straps which galled the tossing neck, this band which spanned
its chest? In those instants of stillness ere the mantle had been
plucked away Nigel had lain forward, had slipped the snaffle between the
champing teeth, and had deftly secured it. Blind, frantic fury surged in the yellow horse's heart once more at this
new degradation, this badge of serfdom and infamy. His spirit rose high
and menacing at the touch. He loathed this place, these people, all and
everything which threatened his freedom. He would have done with them
forever; he would see them no more. Let him away to the uttermost parts
of the earth, to the great plains where freedom is. Anywhere over
the far horizon where he could get away from the defiling bit and the
insufferable mastery of man.
