‘Then, sir, we are upon the same errand,’ quoth the Londoner, bowing
with his hand over his heart, until his sword seemed to point straight
up to the ceiling. ‘The Honourable George Dawnish, at your service! Your
very humble and devoted servant, sir! Yours to command in any or
all ways. It is a real joy and privilege to me, sir, to make your
distinguished acquaintance. Hem!’ The country squire appeared to be somewhat taken aback at this shower
of London compliments. ‘Ahem, sir! Yes, sir!’ said he, bobbing his head.
‘Glad to see you, sir! Most damnably so! But these men, sergeant? Time
presses, for to-morrow is Shepton market, and I would fain see my old
twenty-score boar once more before he is sold. There is a beefy one.
I’ll have him.’
