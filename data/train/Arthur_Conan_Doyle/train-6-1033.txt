“Welcome, Nigel!” said she. He stooped and kissed it. “Saint Catharine has brought me home,” said he. A merry supper it was at Cosford Manor that night, with Nigel at the
head betwixt the jovial old knight and the Lady Mary, whilst at the
farther end Samkin Aylward, wedged between two servant maids, kept his
neighbors in alternate laughter and terror as he told his tales of the
French Wars. Nigel had to turn his doeskin heels and show his little
golden spurs. As he spoke of what was passed Sir John clapped him on the
shoulder, while Mary took his strong right hand in hers, and the good
old priest smiling blessed them both. Nigel had drawn a little golden
ring from his pocket, and it twinkled in the torchlight.
