     'I stretch lame hands of faith and grope
     And gather dust and chaff, and call
     To what I feel is Lord of all,
     And faintly trust the larger hope.' It is the central mystery of mysteries--the problem of sin and
suffering, the one huge difficulty which the reasoner has to solve in
order to vindicate the dealings of God with man. But take our own case
as an example. I, for one, am very clear what I have got out of our
experience. I say it with all humility, but I have a clearer view of
my duties than ever I had before. It has taught me to be less remiss in
saying what I think to be true, less indolent in doing what I feel to be
rightful.‚Äù
