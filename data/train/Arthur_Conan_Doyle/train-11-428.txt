The night was falling, and the Emperor's haggard face gleamed white
through the gloom as he turned it toward me. “Who is that?” he asked. “It is Colonel Gerard,” said Soult. “Have you seen Marshal Grouchy?” “No, Sire. The Prussians were between.” “It does not matter. Nothing matters now. Soult, I will go back.” He tried to turn his horse, but Bertrand seized his bridle. “Ah, Sire,”
 said Soult, “the enemy has had good fortune enough already.” They forced
him on among them. He rode in silence with his chin upon his breast, the
greatest and the saddest of men. Far away behind us those remorseless
guns were still roaring. Sometimes out of the darkness would come
shrieks and screams and the low thunder of galloping hoofs. At the sound
we would spur our horses and hasten onward through the scattered troops.
At last, after riding all night in the clear moonlight, we found that
we had left both pursued and pursuers behind. By the time we passed
over the bridge at Charleroi the dawn was breaking. What a company of
spectres we looked in that cold, clear, searching light, the Emperor
with his face of wax, Soult blotched with powder, Lobau dabbled with
blood! But we rode more easily now, and had ceased to glance over our
shoulders, for Waterloo was more than thirty miles behind us. One of the
Emperor's carriages had been picked up at Charleroi, and we halted now
on the other side of the Sambre, and dismounted from our horses.
