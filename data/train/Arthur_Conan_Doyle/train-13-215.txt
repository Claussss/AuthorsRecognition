      It was a long ten minutes before Grant Munro broke the silence,
      and when his answer came it was one of which I love to think. He
      lifted the little child, kissed her, and then, still carrying
      her, he held his other hand out to his wife and turned towards
      the door.       “We can talk it over more comfortably at home,” said he. “I am
      not a very good man, Effie, but I think that I am a better one
      than you have given me credit for being.”
