In their first rush on to the Basilisk, the Spaniards had seized six of
the crew and four unarmed archers. Their throats had been cut and
their bodies tossed overboard. Now the Spaniards who littered the deck,
wounded and dead, were thrust over the side in the same fashion. One ran
down into the hold and had to be hunted and killed squealing under the
blows like a rat in the darkness. Within half an hour no sign was left
of this grim meeting in the fog save for the crimson splashes upon
bulwarks and deck. The archers, flushed and merry, were unstringing
their bows once more, for in spite of the water glue the damp air took
the strength from the cords. Some were hunting about for arrows which
might have stuck inboard, and some tying up small injuries received in
the scuffle. But an anxious shadow still lingered upon the face of Sir
Robert, and he peered fixedly about him through the fog.
