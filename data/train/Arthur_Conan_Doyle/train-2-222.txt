“Mr. Mortimer Tregennis died during the night, and with exactly the
same symptoms as the rest of his family.” Holmes sprang to his feet, all energy in an instant. “Can you fit us both into your dog-cart?” “Yes, I can.” “Then, Watson, we will postpone our breakfast. Mr. Roundhay, we are
entirely at your disposal. Hurry—hurry, before things get disarranged.” The lodger occupied two rooms at the vicarage, which were in an angle
by themselves, the one above the other. Below was a large sitting-room;
above, his bedroom. They looked out upon a croquet lawn which came up
to the windows. We had arrived before the doctor or the police, so that
everything was absolutely undisturbed. Let me describe exactly the
scene as we saw it upon that misty March morning. It has left an
impression which can never be effaced from my mind.
