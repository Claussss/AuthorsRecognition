      Holmes was down on his knees, examining with great attention the
      knots upon the red cord with which the lady had been secured.
      Then he carefully scrutinized the broken and frayed end where it
      had snapped off when the burglar had dragged it down.       “When this was pulled down, the bell in the kitchen must have
      rung loudly,” he remarked.       “No one could hear it. The kitchen stands right at the back of
      the house.”
