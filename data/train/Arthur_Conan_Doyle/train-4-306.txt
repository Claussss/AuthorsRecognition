On the extreme horizon there was visible a long line of gleaming,
glittering points, which shone and sparkled like a string of diamonds.
These brilliant specks were all in rapid motion, and yet kept their
positions to each other. ‘What is it, then?’ we both cried. ‘Horse upon the march,’ quoth Saxon. ‘It may be our friends of
Salisbury, who have made a long day’s journey; or, as I am inclined
to think, it may be some other body of the King’s horse. They are far
distant, and what we see is but the sun shining on their casques; yet
they are bound for this very village, if I mistake not. It would be
wisest to avoid entering it, lest the rustics set them upon our track.
Let us skirt it and push on for Bruton, where we may spare time for bite
and sup.’
