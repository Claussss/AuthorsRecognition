I looked, after the action, for the old chap, but his body had
disappeared, though how or whither I have no conception. His blood be
upon his own head! He would be alive now if he had not interfered, as
the constables say at home, “with an officer in the execution of his
duty.” The scouts tell me that his name was Ghoolab Shah, and that he was one
of the highest and holiest of the Buddhists. He had great fame in the
district as a prophet and worker of miracles--hence the hubbub when he
was cut down. They tell me that he was living in this very cave when
Tamerlane passed this way in 1399, with a lot more bosh of that sort.
