A friendly Squire at Nigel's elbow whispered the names of the famous
warriors beneath. “You are young Loring of Tilford, the Squire of
Chandos, are you not?” said he. “My name is Delves, and I come from
Doddington in Cheshire. I am the Squire of Sir James Audley, yonder
round-backed man with the dark face and close-cropped beard, who hath
the Saracen head as a crest above him.” “I have heard of him as a man of great valor,” said Nigel, gazing at him
with interest.
