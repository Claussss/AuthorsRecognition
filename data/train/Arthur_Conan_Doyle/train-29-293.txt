to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips. “This is the envelope,” he continued. “The postmark is London—eastern
division. Within are the very words which were upon my father’s last

felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the
snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in the grasp of some
resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can
guard against.”
