It is good to have the magic door shut behind us. On the other
side of that door are the world and its troubles, hopes and fears,
headaches and heartaches, ambitions and disappointments; but within,
as you lie back on the green settee, and face the long lines of your
silent soothing comrades, there is only peace of spirit and rest
of mind in the company of the great dead. Learn to love, learn to
admire them; learn to know what their comradeship means; for until
you have done so the greatest solace and anodyne God has given to
man have not yet shed their blessing upon you. Here behind this
magic door is the rest house, where you may forget the past, enjoy
the present, and prepare for the future.
