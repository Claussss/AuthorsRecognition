Already the head-sails and the main-sail had been raised, while a
hundred willing hands poled her off from the wharf. Now the wind caught
her; heeling over, and quivering with eagerness like an unleashed hound
she flew through the opening and out into the Channel. She was a famous
little schooner, the Marie Rose of Winchelsea, and under her daring
owner Cock Badding, half trader and half pirate, had brought back into
port many a rich cargo taken in mid-Channel, and paid for in blood
rather than money. Small as she was, her great speed and the fierce
character of her master had made her a name of terror along the French
coast, and many a bulky Eastlander or Fleming as he passed the narrow
seas had scanned the distant Kentish shore, fearing lest that ill-omened
purple sail with a gold Christopher upon it should shoot out suddenly
from the dim gray cliffs. Now she was clear of the land, with the wind
on her larboard quarter, every inch of canvas set, and her high sharp
bows smothered in foam, as she dug through the waves.
