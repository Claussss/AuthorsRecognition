      It was arranged as he suggested, though Miss Harrison excused
      herself from leaving the bedroom, in accordance with Holmes’s
      suggestion. What the object of my friend’s manœuvres was I could
      not conceive, unless it were to keep the lady away from Phelps,
      who, rejoiced by his returning health and by the prospect of
      action, lunched with us in the dining-room. Holmes had a still
      more startling surprise for us, however, for, after accompanying
      us down to the station and seeing us into our carriage, he calmly
      announced that he had no intention of leaving Woking.
