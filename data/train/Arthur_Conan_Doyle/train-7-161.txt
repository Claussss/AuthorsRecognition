[Illustration: They haven't hurt you, Norah, have they p139] The kind, grey eyes and calm, sweet face of the Irishwoman brought
comfort and hope to the whole party. She was a devout Roman Catholic,
and it is a creed which forms an excellent prop in hours of danger.
To her, to the Anglican Colonel, to the Nonconformist minister, to the
Presbyterian American, even to the two Pagan black riflemen, religion in
its various forms was fulfilling the same beneficent office,--whispering
always that the worst which the world can do is a small thing, and that,
however harsh the ways of Providence may seem, it is, on the whole, the
wisest and best thing for us that we should go cheerfully whither the
Great Hand guides us. They had not a dogma in common, these fellows in
misfortune, but they held the intimate, deep-lying spirit, the calm,
essential fatalism which is the world-old framework of religion, with
fresh crops of dogmas growing like ephemeral lichens upon its granite
surface.
