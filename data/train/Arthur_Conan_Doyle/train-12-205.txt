CHAPTER XI. A CHEMICAL DEMONSTRATION. 
Raffles Haw led the way through the front door, and crossing over the
gravelled drive pushed open the outer door of the laboratory--the same
through which the McIntyres had seen the packages conveyed from the
waggon. On passing through it Robert found that they were not really
within the building, but merely in a large bare ante-chamber, around
the walls of which were stacked the very objects which had aroused his
curiosity and his father's speculations. All mystery had gone from
them now, however, for while some were still wrapped in their sackcloth
coverings, others had been undone, and revealed themselves as great pigs
of lead.
