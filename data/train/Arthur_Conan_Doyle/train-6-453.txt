Once, late in the afternoon, they overtook a body of a hundred archers
all marching together with two knights riding at their head. They were
passing from Guildford Castle to Reigate Castle, where they were in
garrison. Nigel rode with the knights for some distance, and hinted that
if either was in search of honorable advancement, or wished to do some
small deed, or to relieve himself of any vow, it might be possible to
find some means of achieving it. They were both, however, grave and
elderly men, intent upon their business and with no mind for fond
wayside adventures, so Nigel quickened his pace and left them behind.
