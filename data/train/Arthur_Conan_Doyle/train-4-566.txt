that I could do your royal cause better service at the head of my
musqueteers.’ ‘So be it! So be it!’ said King Monmouth. Setting spurs to his horse, he
raised his hat in response to the cheers of the troops and cantered down
the High Street under a rain of flowers, which showered from roof and

pressed it to his lips, and then pushed it inside his breastplate.
Glancing up, I caught sight, of the smiling face of our host’s daughter
peeping down at us from a casement.
