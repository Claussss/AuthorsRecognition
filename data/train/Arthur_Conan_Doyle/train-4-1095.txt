‘Whom is it that you would see?’ asked the sergeant gruffly. ‘You have a
most infernally long tongue.’ ‘Aye, and a rough one, too, when I have fools to deal with,’ returned
the seaman. ‘If I had you in my watch, lad, for a three years’ cruise, I
would make a man of you yet.’ ‘Pass the old man through!’ cried the sergeant furiously, and the sailor
came stumping in, with his bronzed face all screwed up and twisted,
partly with amusement at his victory over the sergeant, and partly from
a great chunk of tobacco which he was wont to stow within his cheek.
Having glanced round without perceiving me, he put his hands to his
mouth and bellowed out my name, with a string of ‘Ahoys!’ which rang
through the building.
