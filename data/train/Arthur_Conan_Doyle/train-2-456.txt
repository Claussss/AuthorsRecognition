Von Bork flushed crimson. “How dare you speak in such a way!” “If I didn’t dare things, mister, I wouldn’t be in your service. But
I’ll tell you straight what is in my mind. I’ve heard that with you
German politicians when an agent has done his work you are not sorry to
see him put away.” Von Bork sprang to his feet. “Do you dare to suggest that I have given away my own agents!” “I don’t stand for that, mister, but there’s a stool pigeon or a cross
somewhere, and it’s up to you to find out where it is. Anyhow I am
taking no more chances. It’s me for little Holland, and the sooner the
better.”
