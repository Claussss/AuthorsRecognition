“Well, what are we to do now?” asked MacDonald with some gruffness. “Possess our souls in patience and make as little noise as possible,”
 Holmes answered. “What are we here for at all? I really think that you might treat us
with more frankness.” Holmes laughed. “Watson insists that I am the dramatist in real life,”
 said he. “Some touch of the artist wells up within me, and calls
insistently for a well-staged performance. Surely our profession, Mr.
Mac, would be a drab and sordid one if we did not sometimes set the
scene so as to glorify our results. The blunt accusation, the brutal tap
upon the shoulder--what can one make of such a denouement? But the quick
inference, the subtle trap, the clever forecast of coming events, the
triumphant vindication of bold theories--are these not the pride and the
justification of our life's work? At the present moment you thrill with
the glamour of the situation and the anticipation of the hunt. Where
would be that thrill if I had been as definite as a timetable? I only
ask a little patience, Mr. Mac, and all will be clear to you.”
