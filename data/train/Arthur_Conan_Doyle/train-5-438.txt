"Is that you, Smith?" "Hullo, Hastie!" "For God's sake come at once!  Young Lee is drowned!  Here's Harrington
of King's with the news.  The doctor is out.  You'll do, but come along
at once.  There may be life in him." "Have you brandy?" "I'll bring some.  There's a flask on my table." Smith bounded up the stairs, taking three at a time, seized the flask,
and was rushing down with it, when, as he passed Bellingham's room, his
eyes fell upon something which left him gasping and staring upon the
landing.
