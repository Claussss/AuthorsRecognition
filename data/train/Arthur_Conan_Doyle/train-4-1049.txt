of Saxon’s regiment of Wiltshire foot. I am surprised, indeed, that you
should have fallen away from that allegiance to which you did not only
swear yourself, but did administer the oath to so many others.’ ‘Not a whit, Captain, not a whit!’ he answered, resuming his old
bantam-cock manner as soon as he saw that there was no danger. ‘I am
upon oath as true and as leal a man as ever I was.’
