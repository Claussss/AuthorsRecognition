Even stranger was the sight at each side of the room, whence came that
chorus of groans which had first struck upon the ears of Nigel and his
companions. A line of great hogsheads were placed alongside the walls,
and within each sat a man, his head protruding from the top. As they
moved within there was a constant splashing and washing of water. The
white wan faces all turned together as the door flew open, and a cry
of amazement and of hope took the place of those long-drawn moans of
despair.
