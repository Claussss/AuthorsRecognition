THE DAWNING OF THE LIGHT 
Some sixty years ago that acute thinker Lord Brougham remarked that in
the clear sky of scepticism he saw only one small cloud drifting up and
that was Modern Spiritualism.  It was a curiously inverted simile, for
one would surely have expected him to say that in the drifting clouds
of scepticism he saw one patch of clear sky, but at least it showed how
conscious he was of the coming importance of the movement.  Ruskin,
too, an equally agile mind, said that his assurance of immortality
depended upon the observed facts of Spiritualism.  Scores, and indeed
hundreds, of famous names could be quoted who have subscribed the same
statement, and whose support would dignify any cause upon earth.  They
are the higher peaks who have been the first to catch the light, but
the dawn will spread until none are too lowly to share it.  Let us
turn, therefore, and inspect this movement which is most certainly
destined to revolutionise human thought and action as none other has
done within the Christian era.  We shall look at it both in its
strength and in its weakness, for where one is dealing with what one
knows to be true one can fearlessly insist upon the whole of the truth.
