It is a weary way from Vannes to Bordeaux. Coastwise ships are hard to
find, and winds blow north when all brave hearts would fain be speeding
south. A full month has passed from the day when Nigel received his
letter before he stood upon the quay-side of the Garonne amid the
stacked barrels of Gascon wine and helped to lead Pommers down the
gang-planks. Not Aylward himself had a worse opinion of the sea than
the great yellow horse, and he whinnied with joy as he thrust his muzzle
into his master's outstretched hand, and stamped his ringing hoofs upon
the good firm cobblestones. Beside him, slapping his tawny shoulder in
encouragement, was the lean spare form of Back Simon who had remained
ever under Nigel's pennon.
