“He will stay with the rearguard,” said the Emir to his lieutenant. “You
can keep the women with you also.” “And this dragoman dog?” “Put him with the others.” “And they?” “Put them all to death.” 
CHAPTER IX As none of the three could understand Arabic, the order of the Emir
would have been unintelligible to them had it not been for the conduct
of Mansoor. The unfortunate dragoman, after all his treachery and all
his subservience and apostasy, found his worst fears realised when the
Dervish leader gave his curt command. With a shriek of fear the poor
wretch threw himself forward upon his face, and clutched at the Arab's
jibbeh, clawing with his brown fingers at the edge of the cotton skirt.
The Emir tugged to free himself, and then, finding that he was still
held by that convulsive grip, he turned and kicked at Mansoor with
the vicious impatience with which one drives off a pestering cur. The
dragoman's high red tarboosh flew up into the air, and he lay groaning
upon his face where the stunning blow of the Arab's horny foot had left
him.
