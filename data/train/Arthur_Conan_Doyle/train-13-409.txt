      “No clue?” asked Holmes, cocking his eye at the Colonel.       “None as yet. But the affair is a petty one, one of our little
      country crimes, which must seem too small for your attention, Mr.
      Holmes, after this great international affair.”       Holmes waved away the compliment, though his smile showed that it
      had pleased him.       “Was there any feature of interest?”       “I fancy not. The thieves ransacked the library and got very
      little for their pains. The whole place was turned upside down,
      drawers burst open, and presses ransacked, with the result that
      an odd volume of Pope’s ‘Homer,’ two plated candlesticks, an
      ivory letter-weight, a small oak barometer, and a ball of twine
      are all that have vanished.”
