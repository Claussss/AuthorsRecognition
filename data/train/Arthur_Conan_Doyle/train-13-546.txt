      â€œOf course, my first act was to run into the waiting-room. The
      son had gone also. The hall door had been closed, but not shut.
      My page who admits patients is a new boy and by no means quick.
      He waits downstairs, and runs up to show patients out when I ring
      the consulting-room bell. He had heard nothing, and the affair
      remained a complete mystery. Mr. Blessington came in from his
      walk shortly afterwards, but I did not say anything to him upon
      the subject, for, to tell the truth, I have got in the way of
      late of holding as little communication with him as possible.
