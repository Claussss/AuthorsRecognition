"I shall be married at the registrar's," he remarked; "I should
strongly recommend you to do the same." Professor Ainslie Grey was as good as his word.  A fortnight's
cessation of his classes gave him an opportunity which was too good to
let pass.  Mrs. O'James was an orphan, without relations and almost
without friends in the country.  There was no obstacle in the way of a
speedy wedding.  They were married, accordingly, in the quietest manner
possible, and went off to Cambridge together, where the Professor and
his charming wife were present at several academic observances, and
varied the routine of their honeymoon by incursions into biological
laboratories and medical libraries.  Scientific friends were loud in
their congratulations, not only upon Mrs. Grey's beauty, but upon the
unusual quickness and intelligence which she displayed in discussing
physiological questions.  The Professor was himself astonished at the
accuracy of her information.  "You have a remarkable range of knowledge
for a woman, Jeannette," he remarked upon more than one occasion.  He
was even prepared to admit that her cerebrum might be of the normal
weight.
