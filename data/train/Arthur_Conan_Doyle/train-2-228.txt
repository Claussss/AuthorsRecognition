“It would appear so.” “At least we may accept it as a working hypothesis. We will suppose,
then, that something was burned in each case which produced an
atmosphere causing strange toxic effects. Very good. In the first
instance—that of the Tregennis family—this substance was placed in the
fire. Now the window was shut, but the fire would naturally carry fumes
to some extent up the chimney. Hence one would expect the effects of
the poison to be less than in the second case, where there was less
escape for the vapour. The result seems to indicate that it was so,
since in the first case only the woman, who had presumably the more
sensitive organism, was killed, the others exhibiting that temporary or
permanent lunacy which is evidently the first effect of the drug. In
the second case the result was complete. The facts, therefore, seem to
bear out the theory of a poison which worked by combustion.
