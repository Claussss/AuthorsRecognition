      Phelps and I talked it over on our journey, but neither of us
      could devise a satisfactory reason for this new development.       “I suppose he wants to find out some clue as to the burglary last
      night, if a burglar it was. For myself, I don’t believe it was an
      ordinary thief.”       “What is your own idea, then?”       “Upon my word, you may put it down to my weak nerves or not, but
      I believe there is some deep political intrigue going on around
      me, and that for some reason that passes my understanding my life
      is aimed at by the conspirators. It sounds high-flown and absurd,
      but consider the facts! Why should a thief try to break in at a
      bedroom window, where there could be no hope of any plunder, and
      why should he come with a long knife in his hand?”
