“General Razout, explain the situation!” said Lannes, briefly. The engineer officer rose, his compasses in his hand. He led me to the door and pointed to the high grey wall which towered up
amongst the debris of the shattered houses. “That is the enemy's present line of defence,” said he. “It is the wall
of the great Convent of the Madonna. If we can carry it the city must
fall, but they have run countermines all round it, and the walls are so
enormously thick that it would be an immense labour to breach it
with artillery. We happen to know, however, that the enemy have a
considerable store of powder in one of the lower chambers. If that could
be exploded the way would be clear for us.”
