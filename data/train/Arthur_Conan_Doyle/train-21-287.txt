"It lay where he had dropped it when he was first attacked.  The box
was the same which now lies open upon your table.  A key was hung by a
silken cord to that carved handle upon the top.  We opened it, and the
light of the lantern gleamed upon a collection of gems such as I have
read of and thought about when I was a little lad at Pershore.  It was
blinding to look upon them.  When we had feasted our eyes we took them
all out and made a list of them.  There were one hundred and
forty-three diamonds of the first water, including one which has been
called, I believe, 'the Great Mogul' and is said to be the second
largest stone in existence.  Then there were ninety-seven very fine
emeralds, and one hundred and seventy rubies, some of which, however,
were small.  There were forty carbuncles, two hundred and ten
sapphires, sixty-one agates, and a great quantity of beryls, onyxes,
cats'-eyes, turquoises, and other stones, the very names of which I did
not know at the time, though I have become more familiar with them
since.  Besides this, there were nearly three hundred very fine pearls,
twelve of which were set in a gold coronet.  By the way, these last had
been taken out of the chest and were not there when I recovered it.
