“What have you to say to this, brother sacrist?” asked the Abbot in some
perplexity. “I would say, father, that it is within our power to deal gently and
charitably with all that concerns ourselves, but that where a the King's
officer is concerned we are wanting in our duty if we give him less than
the protection that he demands. I would remind you also, holy father,
that this is not the first of this man's violence, but that he has
before now beaten our servants, defied our authority, and put pike in
the Abbot's own fish-pond.”
