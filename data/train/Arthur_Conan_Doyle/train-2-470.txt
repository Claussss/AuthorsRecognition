convulsed with passion. Holmes continued his swift investigation of
documents while his prisoner cursed and swore. “Though unmusical, German is the most expressive of all languages,” he
observed when Von Bork had stopped from pure exhaustion. “Hullo!
Hullo!” he added as he looked hard at the corner of a tracing before
putting it in the box. “This should put another bird in the cage. I had
no idea that the paymaster was such a rascal, though I have long had an
eye upon him. Mister Von Bork, you have a great deal to answer for.”
