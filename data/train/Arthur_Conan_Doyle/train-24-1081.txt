The yellow cog had been engaged, with Goodwin Hawtayne in command, and a
month after the wedding Alleyne rode down to Bucklershard to see if she
had come round yet from Southampton. On the way he passed the fishing
village of Pitt's Deep, and marked that a little creyer or brig was
tacking off the land, as though about to anchor there. On his way back,
as he rode towards the village, he saw that she had indeed anchored, and
that many boats were round her, bearing cargo to the shore.
