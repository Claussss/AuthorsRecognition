“What was it then? A goblet? A silver plate?” For answer Simon opened his bag and shook it on the deck. Sir Robert turned away with a whistle. “'Fore God!” said he, “it is in

XIX. HOW A SQUIRE OF ENGLAND MET A SQUIRE OF FRANCE 
Sir Robert Knolles with his little fleet had sighted the Breton coast
near Cancale; they had rounded the Point du Grouin, and finally had
sailed past the port of St. Malo and down the long narrow estuary of the
Rance until they were close to the old walled city of Dinan, which was
held by that Montfort faction whose cause the English had espoused. Here
the horses had been disembarked, the stores were unloaded, and the whole
force encamped outside the city, whilst the leaders waited for news as
to the present state of affairs, and where there was most hope of honor
and profit.
