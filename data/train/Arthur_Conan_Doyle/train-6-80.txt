Such was the Tilford Manor-house where the last survivors of the old and
magnificent house of Loring still struggled hard to keep a footing and
to hold off the monks and the lawyers from the few acres which were left
to them. The mansion was a two-storied one, framed in heavy beams of
wood, the interstices filled with rude blocks of stone. An outside
staircase led up to several sleeping-rooms above. Below there were only
two apartments, the smaller of which was the bower of the aged Lady
Ermyntrude. The other was the hall, a very large room, which served
as the living room of the family and as the common dining-room of
themselves and of their little group of servants and retainers. The
dwellings of these servants, the kitchens, the offices and the stables
were all represented by a row of penthouses and sheds behind the main
building. Here lived Charles the page, Peter the old falconer, Red Swire
who had followed Nigel's grandfather to the Scottish wars, Weathercote
the broken minstrel, John the cook, and other survivors of more
prosperous days, who still clung to the old house as the barnacles to
some wrecked and stranded vessel.
