A huge warrior in black, bearing a golden banner, appeared suddenly in
a gap of the shredding ranks. He tossed his precious burden to a squire,
who bore it away. Like a pack of hounds on the very haunch of a deer the
English rushed yelling for the oriflamme. But the black warrior flung
himself across their path. “Chargny! Chargny a la recousse!” he
roared with a voice of thunder. Sir Reginald Cobham dropped before his
battle-ax, so did the Gascon de Clisson. Nigel was beaten down on to
the crupper of his horse by a sweeping blow; but at the same instant
Chandos' quick blade passed through the Frenchman's camail and pierced
his throat. So died Geoffrey de Chargny; but the oriflamme was saved.
