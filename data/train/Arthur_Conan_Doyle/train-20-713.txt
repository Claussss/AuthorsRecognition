      “Yes, sir.”       “And are you prepared to meet the cost?”       “I have no doubt, sir, that my friend Godfrey, when we find him,
      will be prepared to do that.”       “But if he is never found, eh? Answer me that!”       “In that case, no doubt his family——”       “Nothing of the sort, sir!” screamed the little man. “Don’t look
      to me for a penny—not a penny! You understand that, Mr.
      Detective! I am all the family that this young man has got, and I
      tell you that I am not responsible. If he has any expectations it
      is due to the fact that I have never wasted money, and I do not
      propose to begin to do so now. As to those papers with which you
      are making so free, I may tell you that in case there should be
      anything of any value among them, you will be held strictly to
      account for what you do with them.”
