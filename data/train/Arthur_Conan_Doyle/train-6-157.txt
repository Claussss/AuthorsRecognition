“Well,” said Aylward, “what have you to say to me, young sir?” “What can I say, my good fellow, save that I thank you with all my
heart? By Saint Paul! if you had been my blood brother you could not

with his critical smile to their conversation. “If you had heard what
was said in the court,” said he, “you would understand that I am not
blessed at this moment with much of this world's gear. The black death
and the monks have between them been heavy upon our estate. Willingly
would I give you a handful of gold for your assistance, since that is
what you seem to crave; but indeed I have it not, and so once more I say
that you must be satisfied with my thanks.”
