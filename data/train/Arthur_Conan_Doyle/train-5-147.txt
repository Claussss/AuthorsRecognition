"Hullo, Mason, you've come at last!" "Yes, Sir John, and I have brought, as I promised, Dr. Wilkinson with
me." "Dr.  Wilkinson!  Why, this is he." Dr. Mason stared in astonishment.  "I have never seen the gentleman
before!" he cried. "Nevertheless I am Dr. Wilkinson--Dr. Horace Wilkinson, of 114 Canal
View." "Good gracious, Sir John!" cried Dr. Mason. "Did you think that in a case of such importance I should call in a
junior local practitioner!  This is Dr. Adam Wilkinson, lecturer on
pulmonary diseases at Regent's College, London, physician upon the
staff of the St. Swithin's Hospital, and author of a dozen works upon
the subject.  He happened to be in Sutton upon a visit, and I thought I
would utilise his presence to have a first-rate opinion upon Lady
Millbank."
