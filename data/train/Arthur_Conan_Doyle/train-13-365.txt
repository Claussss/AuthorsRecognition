      “‘“The butler is gone,” said she.       “‘“Gone! Gone where?”       “‘“He is gone. No one has seen him. He is not in his room. Oh,
      yes, he is gone, he is gone!” She fell back against the wall with
      shriek after shriek of laughter, while I, horrified at this
      sudden hysterical attack, rushed to the bell to summon help. The
      girl was taken to her room, still screaming and sobbing, while I
      made inquiries about Brunton. There was no doubt about it that he
      had disappeared. His bed had not been slept in, he had been seen
      by no one since he had retired to his room the night before, and
      yet it was difficult to see how he could have left the house, as
      both windows and doors were found to be fastened in the morning.
      His clothes, his watch, and even his money were in his room, but
      the black suit which he usually wore was missing. His slippers,
      too, were gone, but his boots were left behind. Where then could
      butler Brunton have gone in the night, and what could have become
      of him now?
