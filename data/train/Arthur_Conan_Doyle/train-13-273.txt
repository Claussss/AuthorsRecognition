      you from thinking better of it, and also to keep you from coming
      into contact with any one who might tell you that your double was
      at work in Mawson’s office. Therefore they gave you a handsome
      advance on your salary, and ran you off to the Midlands, where
      they gave you enough work to do to prevent your going to London,
      where you might have burst their little game up. That is all
      plain enough.”
