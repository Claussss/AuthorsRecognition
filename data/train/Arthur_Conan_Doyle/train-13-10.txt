      â€œEdith Baxter was within thirty yards of the stables, when a man
      appeared out of the darkness and called to her to stop. As he
      stepped into the circle of yellow light thrown by the lantern she
      saw that he was a person of gentlemanly bearing, dressed in a
      grey suit of tweeds, with a cloth cap. He wore gaiters, and
      carried a heavy stick with a knob to it. She was most impressed,
      however, by the extreme pallor of his face and by the nervousness
      of his manner. His age, she thought, would be rather over thirty
      than under it.
