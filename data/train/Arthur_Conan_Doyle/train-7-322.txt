But Mrs. Belmont's eyes were far away, and she shook her head sadly as
she gently put the girl's hands aside. “I do not care how I look. I cannot think of it,” said she; “could
_you_, if you had left the man you love behind you, as I have mine?” “I'm begin--beginning to think I have,” sobbed poor Sadie, and buried
her hot face in Mrs. Belmont's motherly bosom. The Camel Corps had all passed onwards down the khor in pursuit of the
retreating Dervishes, and for a few minutes the escaped prisoners had
been left alone. But now there came a cheery voice calling upon them,
and a red turban bobbed about among the rocks, with the large white face
of the Nonconformist minister smiling from beneath it. He had a thick
lance with which to support his injured leg, and this murderous crutch
combined with his peaceful appearance to give him a most incongruous
aspect,--as of a sheep which has suddenly developed claws. Behind him
were two negroes with a basket and a water-skin.
