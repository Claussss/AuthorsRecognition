‘Simple!’ cried Wade the lawyer, a square-faced, bold-eyed man. ‘Why,
the ring is but the girth of your little finger. A man might do it once
by good luck, but none could ensure it.’ ‘I will lay a guinea a thrust on it,’ said Saxon; and tossing the little
gold circlet up into the air, he flashed out his rapier and made a pass
at it. The ring rasped down the steel blade and tinkled against the
hilt, fairly impaled. By a sharp motion of the wrist he shot it up
to the ceiling again, where it struck a carved rafter and altered its
course; but again, with a quick step forward, he got beneath it and
received it on his sword-point. ‘Surely there is some cavalier present
who is as apt at the trick as I am,’ he said, replacing the ring upon
his finger.
