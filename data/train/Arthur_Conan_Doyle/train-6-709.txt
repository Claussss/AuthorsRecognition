A small troop of mounted bowmen had ridden out of an oak grove upon the
left of the road. They trotted up to where the three knights had halted.
Two wretched peasants whose wrists had been tied to their leathers
came leaping and straining beside the horses in their effort not to be
dragged off their feet. One was a tall, gaunt, yellow-haired man, the
other short and swarthy, but both so crusted with dirt, so matted and
tangled and ragged, that they were more like beasts of the wood than
human beings.
