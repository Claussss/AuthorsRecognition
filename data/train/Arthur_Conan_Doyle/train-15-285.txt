If one gets past your guard may Jove protect you, for their knives are
deadly, and if it comes to a hand-to-hand grapple they are as dangerous
as wild beasts, who would claw out your eyes or your throat. You know
that our fellows of the Tenth Legion have been, ever since Cæsar's time,
as rough soldiers as any with the Eagles, but I can assure you that I
have seen them positively cowed by the fury of these fanatics. As a
matter of fact we have had least to bear, for it has been our task from
the beginning to guard the base of the peninsula upon which this
extraordinary town is built. It has steep precipices upon all the other
sides, so that it is only on this one northern base that fugitives could
escape or a rescue come. Meanwhile, the fifth, fifteenth, and the
twelfth or Syrian legions have done the work, together with the
auxiliaries. Poor devils! we have often pitied them, and there have been
times when it was difficult to say whether we were attacking the town or
the town was attacking us. They broke down our tortoises with their
stones, burned our turrets with their fire, and dashed right through our
whole camp to destroy the supplies in the rear. If any man says a Jew is
not a good soldier, you may be sure that he has never been in Judæa.
