      “You have probably never heard of Professor Moriarty?” said he.       “Never.”       “Aye, there’s the genius and the wonder of the thing!” he cried.
      “The man pervades London, and no one has heard of him. That’s
      what puts him on a pinnacle in the records of crime. I tell you,
      Watson, in all seriousness, that if I could beat that man, if I
      could free society of him, I should feel that my own career had
      reached its summit, and I should be prepared to turn to some more
      placid line in life. Between ourselves, the recent cases in which
      I have been of assistance to the royal family of Scandinavia, and
      to the French republic, have left me in such a position that I
      could continue to live in the quiet fashion which is most
      congenial to me, and to concentrate my attention upon my chemical
      researches. But I could not rest, Watson, I could not sit quiet
      in my chair, if I thought that such a man as Professor Moriarty
      were walking the streets of London unchallenged.”
