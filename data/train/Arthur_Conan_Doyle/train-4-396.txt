‘This cannot go on, sir,’ said the pastor, in a low earnest voice; ‘two
more men have just been hit.’ ‘If fifty more men are hit we must wait until they charge,’ Saxon
answered. ‘What would you do, man? If you leave this shelter you will
be cut off and utterly destroyed. When you have seen as much of war as
I have done, you will learn to put up quietly with what is not to be
avoided. I remember on such another occasion when the rearguard or
nachhut of the Imperial troops was followed by Croats, who were in
the pay of the Grand Turk, I lost half my company before the mercenary
renegades came to close fighting. Ha, my brave boys, they are mounting!
We shall not have to wait long now.’
