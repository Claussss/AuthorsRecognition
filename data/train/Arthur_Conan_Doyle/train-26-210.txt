That is one of the weaknesses of modern life. We complain too
much. We are not ashamed of complaining. Time was when it was
otherwise--when it was thought effeminate to complain. The Gentleman
should always be the Stoic, with his soul too great to be affected
by the small troubles of life. "You look cold, sir," said an English
sympathizer to a French emigre. The fallen noble drew himself up
in his threadbare coat. "Sir," said he, "a gentleman is never cold."
One's consideration for others as well as one's own self-respect
should check the grumble. This self-suppression, and also
the concealment of pain are two of the old noblesse oblige
characteristics which are now little more than a tradition. Public
opinion should be firmer on the matter. The man who must hop because
his shin is hacked, or wring his hand because his knuckles are
bruised should be made to feel that he is an object not of pity,
but of contempt.
