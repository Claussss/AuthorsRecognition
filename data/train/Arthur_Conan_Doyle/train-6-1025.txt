“Rise up!” said the smiling Prince, and he smote with his sword upon
his shoulder. “England has lost a brave Squire, and has gained a gallant
knight. Nay, linger not, I pray! Rise up, Sir Nigel!” 
XXVII. HOW THE THIRD MESSENGER CAME TO COSFORD 
Two months have passed, and the long slopes of Hindhead are russet with
the faded ferns--the fuzzy brown pelt which wraps the chilling earth.
With whoop and scream the wild November wind sweeps over the great
rolling downs, tossing the branches of the Cosford beeches, and rattling
at the rude latticed windows. The stout old knight of Duplin, grown even
a little stouter, with whiter beard to fringe an ever redder face, sits
as of yore at the head of his own board. A well-heaped platter flanked
by a foaming tankard stands before him. At his right sits the Lady Mary,
her dark, plain, queenly face marked deep with those years of weary
waiting, but bearing the gentle grace and dignity which only sorrow and
restraint can give. On his left is Matthew, the old priest. Long ago
the golden-haired beauty had passed from Cosford to Fernhurst, where
the young and beautiful Lady Edith Brocas is the belle of all Sussex, a
sunbeam of smiles and merriment, save perhaps when her thoughts for an
instant fly back to that dread night when she was plucked from under the
very talons of the foul hawk of Shalford.
