Sir Nigel looked about him at his shattered ranks, and his face flushed
with a soldier's pride. “By St. Paul!” he cried, “I have fought in many a little bickering, but
never one that I would be more loth to have missed than this. But you
are wounded, Alleyne?” “It is nought,” answered his squire, stanching the blood which dripped
from a sword-cut across his forehead. “These gentlemen of Spain seem to be most courteous and worthy people. I
see that they are already forming to continue this debate with us. Form
up the bowmen two deep instead of four. By my faith! some very brave men
have gone from among us. Aylward, you are a trusty soldier, for all
that your shoulder has never felt accolade, nor your heels worn the gold
spurs. Do you take charge of the right; I will hold the centre, and you,
my Lord of Angus, the left.”
