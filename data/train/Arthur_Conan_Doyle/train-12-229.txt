“So early as that!” said Robert, thoughtfully. “Well, perhaps it is
better so.” “Much better, Robert. Would it not be dreadful if Hector came back first
and there was a scene? If I were once married I should not mind. Why
should I? But of course Raffles knows nothing about him, and it would be
terrible if they came together.” “That must be avoided at any cost.” “Oh, I cannot bear even to think of it. Poor Hector! And yet what could
I do, Robert? You know that it was only a boy and girl affair. And how
could I refuse such an offer as this? It was a duty to my family, was it
not?”
