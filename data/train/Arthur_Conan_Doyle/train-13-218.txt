      For three months after taking over the practice I was kept very
      closely at work, and saw little of my friend Sherlock Holmes, for
      I was too busy to visit Baker Street, and he seldom went anywhere
      himself save upon professional business. I was surprised,
      therefore, when, one morning in June, as I sat reading the
      _British Medical Journal_ after breakfast, I heard a ring at the
      bell, followed by the high, somewhat strident tones of my old
      companionâ€™s voice.
