“Can you not hear that?” he asked. “Will you ask me now if I make a
mistake?” “Indeed, we are much beholden to you!” cried Nigel. “Let the peasants
dig then, and as silently as they may. Do you keep your ear upon the
ground, Andreas, so that if anyone pass beneath us we shall be warned.” So, amid the driving rain, the little group toiled in the darkness.
The blind man lay silent, flat upon his face, and twice they heard his
warning hiss and stopped their work, whilst some one passed beneath. In
an hour they had dug down to a stone arch which was clearly the outer
side of the tunnel roof. Here was a sad obstacle, for it might take long
to loosen a stone, and if their work was not done by the break of day
then their enterprise was indeed hopeless. They loosened the mortar with
a dagger, and at last dislodged one small stone which enabled them to
get at the others. Presently a dark hole blacker than the night around
them yawned at their feet, and their swords could touch no bottom to it.
They had opened the tunnel.
