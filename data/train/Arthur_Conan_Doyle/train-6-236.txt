At the right side of the monarch and a little behind him rode a youth
some twenty years of age, tall, slim and dark, with noble aquiline
features and keen penetrating eyes which sparkled with vivacity and
affection as he answered the remarks of the King. He was clad in deep
crimson diapered with gold, and the trappings of his white palfrey were
of a magnificence which proclaimed the rank of its rider. On his face,
still free from mustache or beard, there sat a certain gravity and
majesty of expression which showed that young as he was great affairs
had been in his keeping and that his thoughts and interests were those
of the statesman and the warrior. That great day when, little more
than a school-boy, he had led the van of the victorious army which had
crushed the power of France and Crecy, had left this stamp upon his
features; but stern as they were they had not assumed that tinge of
fierceness which in after years was to make “The Black Prince” a name
of terror on the marches of France. Not yet had the first shadow of fell
disease come to poison his nature ere it struck at his life, as he rode
that spring day, light and debonair, upon the heath of Crooksbury.
