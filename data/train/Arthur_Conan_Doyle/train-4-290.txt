‘There would be much weight in your contention,’ my friend answered,
‘were it not that I now bethink me that I had forgot to recharge my
pistol since discharging it at that great yellow beast yesternight.’ Decimus Saxon shook his head sadly. ‘I doubt we shall never make a
soldier of you,’ he remarked. ‘You fall from your horse if the brute
does bit change his step, you show a levity which will not jump with the
gravity of the true soldado, you present empty petronels as a menace,
and finally, you crave permission to tie your armour--armour which the
Cid himself might be proud to wear--around the neck of your horse. Yet
you have heart and mettle, I believe, else you would not be here.’
