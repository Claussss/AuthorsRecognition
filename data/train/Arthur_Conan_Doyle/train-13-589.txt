      Five minutes later we were in the street, walking towards
      Regent’s Circus.       “You wonder,” said my companion, “why it is that Mycroft does not
      use his powers for detective work. He is incapable of it.”       “But I thought you said—”       “I said that he was my superior in observation and deduction. If
      the art of the detective began and ended in reasoning from an
      armchair, my brother would be the greatest criminal agent that
      ever lived. But he has no ambition and no energy. He will not
      even go out of his way to verify his own solutions, and would
      rather be considered wrong than take the trouble to prove himself
      right. Again and again I have taken a problem to him, and have
      received an explanation which has afterwards proved to be the
      correct one. And yet he was absolutely incapable of working out
      the practical points which must be gone into before a case could
      be laid before a judge or jury.”
