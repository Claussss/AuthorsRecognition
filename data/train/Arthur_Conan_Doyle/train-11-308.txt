“The horses,” I suggested. “Save your handful of cavalry; there are none left.” “The band,” said I. He laughed, even in his despair. “Why the band?” he asked. “Fighting men are of value.” “Good,” said he. “You would play the game down to the last card and so
would I. Good, Gerard, good!” He clasped my hand in his. “But there is one chance for us yet, Gerard.”
 He unhooked a lantern from the roof of the waggon and he laid it on
a map which was stretched before him. “To the south of us,” said he,
“there lies the town of Minsk. I have word from a Russian deserter that
much corn has been stored in the town-hall. I wish you to take as many
men as you think best, set forth for Minsk, seize the corn, load any
carts which you may collect in the town, and bring them to me between
here and Smolensk. If you fail it is but a detachment cut off. If you
succeed it is new life to the army.”
