Chapter XXV. Of Strange Doings in the Boteler Dungeon ‘Take down this fellow’s statement,’ said the Duke to his scrivener.
‘Now, sirrah, it may not be known to you that his gracious Majesty the
King hath conferred plenary powers upon me during these troubled times,
and that I have his warrant to deal with all traitors without either
jury or judge. You do bear a commission, I understand, in the rebellious
body which is here described as Saxon’s regiment of Wiltshire Foot?
Speak the truth for your neck’s sake.’
