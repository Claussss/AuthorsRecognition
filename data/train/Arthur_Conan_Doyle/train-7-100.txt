And then, just as the foremost rushed to lay hands upon them, a most
unexpected incident arrested them. From the time of the first appearance
of the Dervishes the fat clergyman of Birmingham had looked like a man
in a cataleptic trance. He had neither moved nor spoken. But now he
suddenly woke at a bound into strenuous and heroic energy. It may have
been the mania of fear, or it may have been the blood of some Berserk
ancestor which stirred suddenly in his veins; but he broke into a wild
shout, and, catching up a stick, he struck right and left among the
Arabs with a fury which was more savage than their own. One who helped
to draw up this narrative has left it upon record that of all the
pictures which have been burned into his brain, there is none so clear
as that of this man, his large face shining with perspiration, and his
great body dancing about with unwieldy agility, as he struck at the
shrinking, snarling savages.
