‘My father would have you go forth as a knight-errant, Micah,’ said
Reuben, laughing. ‘You might chance to get your own skin beaten and your
own leather tanned.’ ‘Who ever knew so long a tongue in so short a body?’ cried the
innkeeper. ‘But in good sooth, Master Micah, I am in sober earnest when
I say that you are indeed wasting the years of your youth, when life is
sparkling and clear, and that you will regret it when you have come to
the flat and flavourless dregs of old age.’
