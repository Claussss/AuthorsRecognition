“Well, all I can say is, that you've got more nerve and pluck than I
shall ever have. I don't wonder now at your winning that Cross in the
Mutiny. If I was to go on listening night after night to them things
without ever taking a drop of something to cheer my heart--why, it would
drive me silly.” General Heatherstone put his hand up, as though afraid that his
companion might say too much. “I must thank you, Mr. West,” he said, “for having shown this man my
door. I would not willingly allow an old comrade, however humble, to go
to the bad, and if I did not acknowledge his claim more readily it
was simply because I had my doubts as to whether he was really what he
represented himself to be. Just walk up to the Hall, Corporal, and I
shall follow you in a minute.”
