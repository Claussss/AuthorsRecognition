‘I am the keeper of my own honour, your Grace,’ I answered. ‘As to my
life, I should not be standing here this moment if I had any great dread
of losing it. It is right that I should tell you that my Colonel hath
sworn to exact a return for any evil that may befall me, on you or any
of your household who may come into his power. This I say, not as a
threat, but as a warning, for I know him to be a man who is like to be
as good as his word.’
