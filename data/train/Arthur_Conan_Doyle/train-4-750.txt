          Non civium ardor prava jubentium
          Non vultus instantis tyranni

dust-heap of a world has never had such attractions for me that it would
be a pang to leave it. Never, at least, until my marriage--and that, you
will find, alters your thoughts about the value of your life, and many
other of your thoughts as well. This being so, I stood erect, with my
eyes fixed upon the angry nobleman, while his soldiers were putting the
gyves about my wrists.
