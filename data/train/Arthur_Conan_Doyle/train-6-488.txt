“But, my fair lord,” cried the Mayor, as he hurried along, keeping pace
with the long strides of the soldier, “I knew that you warned me to take
all care of the papers; but surely there was no matter of great import
in it? It was but to say what stores were to be sent after you to
Calais?” “Is that not everything?” cried Chandos impatiently. “Can you not see,
oh foolish Master Wintersole, that the French suspect we are about to
make some attempt and that they have sent Peter the Red Ferret, as they
have sent him many times before, to get tidings of whither we are bound?
Now that he knows that the stores are for Calais, then the French near
Calais will take his warning, and so the King's whole plan come to
nothing.”
