“Surely in your hands, Mr. Haw, nothing but good can come of it,” he
said. “I hope not--I pray not--most earnestly do I pray not. I have done for
you, Robert, what I might not have done for my own brother had I one,
and I have done it because I believe and hope that you are a man who
would not use this power, should you inherit it, for selfish ends.
But even now I have not told you all. There is one link which I have
withheld from you, and which shall be withheld from you while I live.
But look at this chest, Robert.”
