tangled head. “Nay, I know nothing of it. You never said that there was
aught of price in the bag, else had I kept a better eye upon it. Certes!

the world's end if I knew where I could find her, but to search these
woods for her is to look for a mouse in a wheat-field. Good Saint
George, thou who didst overcome the Dragon, I pray you by that most
honorable and knightly achievement that you will be with me now! And
you also, great Saint Julian, patron of all wayfarers in distress! Two
candles shall burn before your shrine at Godalming, if you will but
bring me back my saddle-bag. What would I not give to have it back?”
