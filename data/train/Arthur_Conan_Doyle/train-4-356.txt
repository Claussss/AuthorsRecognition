forced in self-defence to draw our swords, when the tall minister whom
we had already observed shoved his way through the crowd, and by dint of
his lofty stature and commanding voice prevailed upon them to be silent. ‘How say ye,’ he asked, turning upon us, ‘fight ye for Baal or for the
Lord? He who is not with us is against us.’ ‘Which is the side of Baal, most reverend sir, and which of the Lord?’
asked Sir Gervas Jerome. ‘Methinks if you were to speak plain English
instead of Hebrew we might come to an understanding sooner.’
