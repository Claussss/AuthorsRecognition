Colonel. “No use, sir,” said Mansoor. “They say that he is too fat, and that they
will not take him any farther. He will die, they say, and why should
they trouble about him?” “Not take him!” cried Cochrane. “Why, the man will perish of hunger and
thirst. Where's the Emir? Hi!” he shouted, as the black-bearded Arab
passed, with a tone like that in which he used to summon a dilatory
donkey-boy. The chief did not deign to answer him, but said something
to one of the guards, who dashed the butt of his Remington into the
Colonel's ribs.
