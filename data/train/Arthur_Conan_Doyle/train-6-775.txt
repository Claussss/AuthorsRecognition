Swiftly and yet quietly the dispositions were made, for these were old
soldiers whose daily trade was war. In little groups the archers formed
in front of each slit or crevice in the walls, whilst others scanned
the battlements with wary eyes, and sped an arrow at every face which
gleamed for an instant above them. The garrison shot forth a shower of
crossbow bolts and an occasional stone from their engine, but so deadly
was the hail which rained upon them that they had no time to dwell upon
their aim, and their discharges were wild and harmless. Under cover of
the shafts of the bowmen a line of peasants ran unscathed to the edge
of the ditch, each hurling in the bundle which he bore in his arms, and
then hurrying back for another one. In twenty minutes a broad pathway
of fagots lay level with the ground upon one side and the gate upon
the other. With the loss of two peasants slain by bolts and one archer
crushed by a stone, the ditch had been filled up. All was ready for the
battering-ram.
