The Red Ferret was one deed toward his vow. Surely a second, and perhaps
a better, was to be found somewhere upon this glorious countryside.
He had borne himself as the others had in the sea-fight, and could
not count it to his credit where he had done no more than mere duty.
Something beyond this was needed for such a deed as could be laid at the
feet of the Lady Mary. But surely it was to be found here in fermenting
war-distracted Brittany. Then with two done it would be strange if he
could not find occasion for that third one, which would complete his
service and set him free to look her in the face once more. With the
great yellow horse curveting beneath him, his Guildford armor gleaming
in the sun, his sword clanking against his stirrup-iron, and his
father's tough ash-spear in his hand, he rode with a light heart and a
smiling face, looking eagerly to right and to left for any chance which
his good Fate might send.
