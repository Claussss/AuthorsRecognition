XXII. HOW ROBERT OF BEAUMANOIR CAME TO PLOERMEL 
Sir Robert Knolles and his men passed onward that day, looking back many
a time to see the two dark columns of smoke, one thicker and one more
slender, which arose from the castle and from the fort of La Brohiniere.
There was not an archer nor a man-at-arms who did not bear a great
bundle of spoil upon his back, and Knolles frowned darkly as he looked
upon them. Gladly would he have thrown it all down by the roadside, but
he had tried such matters before, and he knew that it was as safe to
tear a half-gnawed bone from a bear as their blood-won plunder from such
men as these. In any case it was but two days' march to Ploermel, where
he hoped to bring his journey to an end.
