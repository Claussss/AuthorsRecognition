“And I a better man. I suppose it is just for that that trouble comes
to us. Look how it has brought out the virtues of all our friends. Take
poor Mr. Stuart, for example. Should we ever have known what a noble,
constant man he was? And see Belmont and his wife, in front of us,
there, going fearlessly forward, hand in hand, thinking only of each
other. And Cochrane, who always seemed on board the boat to be a rather
stand-offish, narrow sort of man! Look at his courage, and his unselfish
indignation when any one is ill used. Fardet, too, is as brave as a
lion. I think misfortune has done us all good.”
