CHAPTER I. HOW THE BLACK SHEEP CAME FORTH FROM THE FOLD. 
The great bell of Beaulieu was ringing. Far away through the forest
might be heard its musical clangor and swell. Peat-cutters on Blackdown

common as the chatter of the jays and the booming of the bittern. Yet

each other, for the angelus had already gone and vespers was still far
off. Why should the great bell of Beaulieu toll when the shadows were
neither short nor long?
