      Months afterwards a curious newspaper cutting reached us from
      Buda-Pesth. It told how two Englishmen who had been traveling
      with a woman had met with a tragic end. They had each been
      stabbed, it seems, and the Hungarian police were of opinion that
      they had quarreled and had inflicted mortal injuries upon each
      other. Holmes, however, is, I fancy, of a different way of
      thinking, and holds to this day that, if one could find the
      Grecian girl, one might learn how the wrongs of herself and her
      brother came to be avenged.
