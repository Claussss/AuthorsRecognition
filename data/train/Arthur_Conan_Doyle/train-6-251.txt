 said the prelate. “By suffering and tribulation the soul is cleansed,
and the true victor may be he who by the patient endurance of misfortune
merits the happiness to come.” “If that be the true meaning of the Church's blessing, then I hope that
it will be long before it rests upon our banners in France,” said the
King. “But methinks that when one is out with a brave horse and a good
hawk one might find some other subject than theology. Back to the
birds, Bishop, or Raoul the falconer will come to interrupt thee in thy
cathedral.”
