“And Belgium?” “Yes, and Belgium, too.” Von Bork shook his head. “I don’t see how that could be. There is a
definite treaty there. She could never recover from such a
humiliation.” “She would at least have peace for the moment.” “But her honour?” “Tut, my dear sir, we live in a utilitarian age. Honour is a mediæval
conception. Besides England is not ready. It is an inconceivable thing,
but even our special war tax of fifty million, which one would think
made our purpose as clear as if we had advertised it on the front page
of the _Times_, has not roused these people from their slumbers. Here
and there one hears a question. It is my business to find an answer.
Here and there also there is an irritation. It is my business to soothe
it. But I can assure you that so far as the essentials go—the storage
of munitions, the preparation for submarine attack, the arrangements
for making high explosives—nothing is prepared. How, then, can England
come in, especially when we have stirred her up such a devil’s brew of
Irish civil war, window-breaking Furies, and God knows what to keep her
thoughts at home.”
