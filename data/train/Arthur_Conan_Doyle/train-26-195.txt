   "In the fell clutch of Circumstance
      I have not winced nor cried aloud,
    Beneath the bludgeonings of Chance
      My head is bloody but unbowed." It was not what Lady Byron called "the mimic woe" of the poet, but
it was rather the grand defiance of the Indian warrior at the stake,
whose proud soul can hold in hand his quivering body. There were two quite distinct veins of poetry in Henley, each the
very extreme from the other. The one was heroic, gigantic, running
to large sweeping images and thundering words. Such are the "Song of
the Sword" and much more that he has written, like the wild singing
of some Northern scald. The other, and to my mind both the more
characteristic and the finer side of his work, is delicate, precise,
finely etched, with extraordinarily vivid little pictures drawn
in carefully phrased and balanced English. Such are the "Hospital
Verses," while the "London Voluntaries" stand midway between the two
styles. What! you have not read the "Hospital Verses!" Then get the
"Book of Verses" and read them without delay. You will surely find
something there which, for good or ill, is unique. You can name--or
at least I can name--nothing to compare it with. Goldsmith and
Crabbe have written of indoor themes; but their monotonous, if
majestic metre, wearies the modern reader. But this is so varied,
so flexible, so dramatic. It stands by itself. Confound the weekly
journals and all the other lightning conductors which caused such a
man to pass away, and to leave a total output of about five booklets
behind him!
