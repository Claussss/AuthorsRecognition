When my senses came back to me I was sitting in a small chamber, very
different from the one in which I had been working.  It was cosey and
bright, with chintz-covered settees, colored hangings, and a thousand
pretty little trifles upon the wall.  A small ornamental clock ticked
in front of me, and the hands pointed to half-past three.  It was all
quite familiar to me, and yet I stared about for a moment in a
half-dazed way until my eyes fell upon a cabinet photograph of myself
upon the top of the piano.  On the other side stood one of Mrs. Marden.
Then, of course, I remembered where I was.  It was Agatha's boudoir.
