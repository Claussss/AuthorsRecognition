hand and looking gravely and sadly into my eyes. “You must remember that
what will happen in the future is not necessarily bad because it does
not fall in with your preconceived ideas of right. Be not hasty in your
judgments. There are certain great rules which must be carried out, at
whatever cost to individuals. Their operation may appear to you to be
harsh and cruel, but that is as nothing compared with the dangerous
precedent which would be established by not enforcing them. The ox and
the sheep are safe from us, but the man with the blood of the highest
upon his hands should not and shall not live.”
