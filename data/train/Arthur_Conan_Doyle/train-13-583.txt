X. The Greek Interpreter       During my long and intimate acquaintance with Mr. Sherlock Holmes
      I had never heard him refer to his relations, and hardly ever to
      his own early life. This reticence upon his part had increased
      the somewhat inhuman effect which he produced upon me, until
      sometimes I found myself regarding him as an isolated phenomenon,
      a brain without a heart, as deficient in human sympathy as he was
      pre-eminent in intelligence. His aversion to women and his
      disinclination to form new friendships were both typical of his
      unemotional character, but not more so than his complete
      suppression of every reference to his own people. I had come to
      believe that he was an orphan with no relatives living, but one
      day, to my very great surprise, he began to talk to me about his
      brother.
