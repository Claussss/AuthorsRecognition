      “I wrote it rather hurriedly.”       “You see you begin, ‘Whereas, at about a quarter to one on
      Tuesday morning an attempt was made,’ and so on. It was at a
      quarter to twelve, as a matter of fact.”       I was pained at the mistake, for I knew how keenly Holmes would
      feel any slip of the kind. It was his specialty to be accurate as
      to fact, but his recent illness had shaken him, and this one
      little incident was enough to show me that he was still far from
      being himself. He was obviously embarrassed for an instant, while
      the Inspector raised his eyebrows, and Alec Cunningham burst into
      a laugh. The old gentleman corrected the mistake, however, and
      handed the paper back to Holmes.
