      Holmes examined it for some time, and then, folding it carefully
      up, he placed it in his pocketbook.       “This promises to be a most interesting and unusual case,” said
      he. “You gave me a few particulars in your letter, Mr. Hilton
      Cubitt, but I should be very much obliged if you would kindly go
      over it all again for the benefit of my friend, Dr. Watson.”       “I’m not much of a story-teller,” said our visitor, nervously
      clasping and unclasping his great, strong hands. “You’ll just ask
      me anything that I don’t make clear. I’ll begin at the time of my
      marriage last year, but I want to say first of all that, though
      I’m not a rich man, my people have been at Riding Thorpe for a
      matter of five centuries, and there is no better known family in
      the County of Norfolk. Last year I came up to London for the
      Jubilee, and I stopped at a boarding-house in Russell Square,
      because Parker, the vicar of our parish, was staying in it. There
      was an American young lady there—Patrick was the name—Elsie
      Patrick. In some way we became friends, until before my month was
      up I was as much in love as a man could be. We were quietly
      married at a registry office, and we returned to Norfolk a wedded
      couple. You’ll think it very mad, Mr. Holmes, that a man of a
      good old family should marry a wife in this fashion, knowing
      nothing of her past or of her people, but if you saw her and knew
      her, it would help you to understand.
