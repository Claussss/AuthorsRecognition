it. It is not for you nor for your house that I have done it, but only
because it was my pleasure so to do.” The Abbot flushed at the bold words, and bit his lip with vexation. It was the sacrist, however, who answered: “It would be more fitting and
more gracious,” said he, “if you were to speak to the holy Father Abbot
in a manner suited to his high rank and to the respect which is due to a
Prince of the Church.”
