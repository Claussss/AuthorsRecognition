“Nay, fair kinsman, that may not be,” said she. “I will make such
preparation as I may for the King. He will bear in mind that if the
house of Loring can give nothing else, they have always held their blood
and their lives at his disposal.” Chandos was to ride on to Farnham Castle and beyond, but he expressed
his desire to have a warm bath ere he left Tilford, for like most of his
fellow-knights, he was much addicted to simmering in the hottest
water that he could possibly endure. The bath therefore, a high hooped
arrangement like a broader but shorter churn, was carried into the
privacy of the guest-chamber, and thither it was that Nigel was summoned
to hold him company while he stewed and sweltered in his tub.
