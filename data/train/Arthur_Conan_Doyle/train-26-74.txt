Physically, Gibbon was as small as Johnson was large, but there was
a curious affinity in their bodily ailments. Johnson, as a youth,
was ulcerated and tortured by the king's evil, in spite of the Royal
touch. Gibbon gives us a concise but lurid account of his own
boyhood.   "I was successively afflicted by lethargies and fevers, by
  opposite tendencies to a consumptive and dropsical habit,
  by a contraction of my nerves, a fistula in my eye, and the
  bite of a dog, most vehemently suspected of madness. Every
  practitioner was called to my aid, the fees of the doctors
  were swelled by the bills of the apothecaries and surgeons.
  There was a time when I swallowed more physic than food, and
  my body is still marked by the indelible scars of lancets,
  issues, and caustics."
