A loud wail of horror rose from the lines of tonsured heads which
skirted the high wall--a wail which suddenly died away into a long
hushed silence, broken at last by a rapturous cry of thanksgiving and of
joy. On the road which led to the old dark manor-house upon the side of
the hill a youth had been riding. His mount was a sorry one, a weedy,
shambling, long-haired colt, and his patched tunic of faded purple with
stained leather belt presented no very smart appearance; yet in the
bearing of the man, in the poise of his head, in his easy graceful
carriage, and in the bold glance of his large blue eyes, there was that
stamp of distinction and of breed which would have given him a place
of his own in any assembly. He was of small stature, but his frame
was singularly elegant and graceful. His face, though tanned with
the weather, was delicate in features and most eager and alert in
expression. A thick fringe of crisp yellow curls broke from under the
dark flat cap which he was wearing, and a short golden beard hid the
outline of his strong square chin. One white osprey feather thrust
through a gold brooch in the front of his cap gave a touch of grace to
his somber garb. This and other points of his attire, the short hanging
mantle, the leather-sheathed hunting-knife, the cross belt which
sustained a brazen horn, the soft doe-skin boots and the prick spurs,
would all disclose themselves to an observer; but at the first glance
the brown face set in gold and the dancing light of the quick, reckless,
laughing eyes, were the one strong memory left behind.
