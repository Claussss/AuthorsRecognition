      “I should like to have a peep at each of them,” said Holmes. “Is
      it possible?”       “No difficulty in the world,” Soames answered. “This set of rooms
      is quite the oldest in the college, and it is not unusual for
      visitors to go over them. Come along, and I will personally
      conduct you.”       “No names, please!” said Holmes, as we knocked at Gilchrist’s
      door. A tall, flaxen-haired, slim young fellow opened it, and
      made us welcome when he understood our errand. There were some
      really curious pieces of mediæval domestic architecture within.
      Holmes was so charmed with one of them that he insisted on
      drawing it in his notebook, broke his pencil, had to borrow one
      from our host and finally borrowed a knife to sharpen his own.
      The same curious accident happened to him in the rooms of the
      Indian—a silent, little, hook-nosed fellow, who eyed us askance,
      and was obviously glad when Holmes’s architectural studies had
      come to an end. I could not see that in either case Holmes had
      come upon the clue for which he was searching. Only at the third
      did our visit prove abortive. The outer door would not open to
      our knock, and nothing more substantial than a torrent of bad
      language came from behind it. “I don’t care who you are. You can
      go to blazes!” roared the angry voice. “Tomorrow’s the exam, and
      I won’t be drawn by anyone.”
