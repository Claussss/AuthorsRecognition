musical voice, looking from the captain to the mate. “I hope that your
poor sailors have found pleasant quarters.” “We are all safe,” the captain answered. “But we had given you up for
lost--you and your two friends. Indeed, I was just making arrangements
for your burial with Mr. West here.” The stranger looked at me and smiled. “We won't give Mr. West that trouble for a little time yet,” he
remarked; “my friends and I came ashore all safe, and we have found
shelter in a hut a mile or so along the coast. It is lonely down there,
but we have everything which we can desire.”
