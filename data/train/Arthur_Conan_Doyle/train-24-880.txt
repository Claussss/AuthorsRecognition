“Not so, by St. Paul!” cried Sir Nigel. “It does not accord with mine
honor, nor shall it ever be said that I, a knight of England, was ready
to hold parley with men who have slain a fair lady and a holy priest.” “As well hold parley with a pack of ravening wolves,” said the French
captain. “Ha! Notre Dame Du Guesclin! Saint Ives! Saint Ives!” As he thundered forth his war-cry, the Jacks who had been gathering
before the black arch of the gateway rushed in madly in a desperate
effort to carry the staircase. Their leaders were a small man, dark in
the face, with his beard done up in two plaits, and another larger man,
very bowed in the shoulders, with a huge club studded with sharp nails
in his hand. The first had not taken three steps ere an arrow from
Aylward's bow struck him full in the chest, and he fell coughing and
spluttering across the threshold. The other rushed onwards, and breaking
between Du Guesclin and Sir Nigel he dashed out the brains of the
Bohemian with a single blow of his clumsy weapon. With three swords
through him he still struggled on, and had almost won his way through
them ere he fell dead upon the stair. Close at his heels came a hundred
furious peasants, who flung themselves again and again against the five
swords which confronted them. It was cut and parry and stab as quick as
eye could see or hand act. The door was piled with bodies, and the stone
floor was slippery with blood. The deep shout of Du Guesclin, the hard,
hissing breath of the pressing multitude, the clatter of steel, the
thud of falling bodies, and the screams of the stricken, made up such
a medley as came often in after years to break upon Alleyne's sleep.
Slowly and sullenly at last the throng drew off, with many a fierce
backward glance, while eleven of their number lay huddled in front of
the stair which they had failed to win.
