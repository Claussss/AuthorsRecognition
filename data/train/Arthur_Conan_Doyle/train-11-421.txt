“The Old Guard is beaten! The Guard retreats!” An officer with a livid
face passed me yelling out these words of woe. “Save yourselves! Save
yourselves! You are betrayed!” cried another. “Save yourselves! Save
yourselves!” Men were rushing madly to the rear, blundering and jumping
like frightened sheep. Cries and screams rose from all around me. And at
that moment, as I looked at the British position, I saw what I can
never forget. A single horseman stood out black and clear upon the
ridge against the last red angry glow of the setting sun. So dark, so
motionless, against that grim light, he might have been the very spirit
of Battle brooding over that terrible valley. As I gazed, he raised his
hat high in the air, and at the signal, with a low, deep roar like a
breaking wave, the whole British army flooded over their ridge and came
rolling down into the valley.
