In spite of the old soldier's vigilance, we managed to hold
communication with our friends. Immediately behind the Hall there was a spot where the fencing had been
so carelessly erected that two of the rails could be removed without
difficulty, leaving a broad gap, which gave us the opportunity for
many a stolen interview, though they were necessarily short, for the
general's movements were erratic, and no part of the grounds was secure
from his visitations.
