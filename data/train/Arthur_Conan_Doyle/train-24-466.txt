“Raise two more mantlets by the poop-lanthorn,” said Sir Nigel quietly. “And another man to the tiller,” cried the master-shipman. “Keep them in play, Aylward, with ten of your men,” the knight
continued. “And let ten of Sir Oliver's bowmen do as much for the
Genoese. I have no mind as yet to show them how much they have to fear
from us.” Ten picked shots under Aylward stood in line across the broad deck, and
it was a lesson to the young squires who had seen nothing of war to note
how orderly and how cool were these old soldiers, how quick the command,
and how prompt the carrying out, ten moving like one. Their comrades
crouched beneath the bulwarks, with many a rough jest and many a scrap
of criticism or advice. “Higher, Wat, higher!” “Put thy body into it,
Will!” “Forget not the wind, Hal!” So ran the muttered chorus, while
high above it rose the sharp twanging of the strings, the hiss of the
shafts, and the short “Draw your arrow! Nick your arrow! Shoot wholly
together!” from the master-bowman.
