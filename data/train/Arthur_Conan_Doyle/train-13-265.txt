      Again and much louder came the rat-tat-tat. We all gazed
      expectantly at the closed door. Glancing at Holmes, I saw his
      face turn rigid, and he leaned forward in intense excitement.
      Then suddenly came a low guggling, gargling sound, and a brisk
      drumming upon woodwork. Holmes sprang frantically across the room
      and pushed at the door. It was fastened on the inner side.
      Following his example, we threw ourselves upon it with all our
      weight. One hinge snapped, then the other, and down came the door
      with a crash. Rushing over it, we found ourselves in the inner
      room. It was empty.
