Picking our way across the moor, we directed our course for the bright
point which twinkled in the distance; and as we advanced we hazarded
a thousand conjectures as to whence it could come. If it were a human
dwelling, what sort of being could it be who, not content with living in
the heart of this wilderness, had chosen a spot so far removed from the
ordinary tracks which crossed it? The roadway was miles behind us, and
it was probable that no one save those driven by such a necessity as
that which had overtaken us would ever find themselves in that desolate
region. No hermit could have desired an abode more completely isolated
from all communion with his kind.
