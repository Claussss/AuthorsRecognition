“It was an ill day for Waverley that you brought such a monster within
its bounds,” said the Abbot. “If the subprior and Brother John be indeed
dead, then it would seem that if the horse be not the Devil he is at

upon Brother John, and had you seen him tossing the subprior as a dog
shakes a rat you would perchance have felt even as I did.”
