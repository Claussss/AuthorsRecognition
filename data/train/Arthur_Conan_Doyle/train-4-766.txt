‘I am much beholden to you, sir,’ I answered, ‘but I fear that there is
no help which you can give me, unless, indeed, you could convey news to
my friends in the army of what hath befallen me.’ ‘I might do that,’ whispered Farmer Brown. ‘Hark ye in your ear, lad,
what I never breathed to man yet. Mine own conscience pricks me at times
over this bolstering up of a Papist to rule over a Protestant nation.
Let like rule like, say I. At the ‘lections I rode to Sudbury, and I
put in my vote for Maister Evans, of Turnford, who was in favour o’ the
Exclusionists. Sure enough, if that same Bill had been carried, the Duke
would be sitting on his father’s throne. The law would have said yes.
Now, it says nay. A wonderful thing is the law with its yea, yea, and
nay, nay, like Barclay, the Quaker man, that came down here in a leather
suit, and ca’d the parson a steepleman. There’s the law. It’s no use
shootin’ at it, or passin’ pikes through it, no, nor chargin’ at it wi’
a troop of horse. If it begins by saying “nay” it will say “nay” to the
end of the chapter. Ye might as well fight wi’ the book o’ Genesis. Let
Monmouth get the law changed, and it will do more for him than all the
dukes in England. For all that he’s a Protestant, and I would do what I
might to serve him.’
