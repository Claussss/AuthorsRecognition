He was a man somewhat above middle age, with thin lemon-colored hair, a
curling mustache, a tufted chin of the same hue, and a high craggy face,
all running to a great hook of the nose, like the beak of an eagle. His
skin was tanned a brown-red by much exposure to the wind and sun. In
height he was tall, and his figure was thin and loose-jointed, but
stringy and hard-bitten. One eye was entirely covered by its lid, which
lay flat over an empty socket, but the other danced and sparkled with a
most roguish light, darting here and there with a twinkle of humor and
criticism and intelligence, the whole fire of his soul bursting through
that one narrow cranny.
