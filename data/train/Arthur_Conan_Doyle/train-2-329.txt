“May I ask what your name is?” “No, you may not,” said he with decision. The situation was awkward, but the most direct way is often the best. “Where is the Lady Frances Carfax?” I asked. He stared at me with amazement. “What have you done with her? Why have you pursued her? I insist upon
an answer!” said I. The fellow gave a bellow of anger and sprang upon me like a tiger. I
have held my own in many a struggle, but the man had a grip of iron and
the fury of a fiend. His hand was on my throat and my senses were
nearly gone before an unshaven French _ouvrier_ in a blue blouse darted
out from a _cabaret_ opposite, with a cudgel in his hand, and struck my
assailant a sharp crack over the forearm, which made him leave go his
hold. He stood for an instant fuming with rage and uncertain whether he
should not renew his attack. Then, with a snarl of anger, he left me
and entered the cottage from which I had just come. I turned to thank
my preserver, who stood beside me in the roadway.
