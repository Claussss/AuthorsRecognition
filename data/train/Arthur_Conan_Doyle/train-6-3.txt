I am aware that there are incidents which may strike the modern reader
as brutal and repellent. It is useless, however, to draw the Twentieth
Century and label it the Fourteenth. It was a sterner age, and men's
code of morality, especially in matters of cruelty, was very different.
There is no incident in the text for which very good warrant may not be
given. The fantastic graces of Chivalry lay upon the surface of life,
but beneath it was a half-savage population, fierce and animal, with
little ruth or mercy. It was a raw, rude England, full of elemental
passions, and redeemed only by elemental virtues. Such I have tried to
draw it.
