Is it not at least possible that this gift was psychic power, and that
Christ, as the greatest exponent who has ever appeared upon earth of
that power, desired to surround Himself with others who possessed it to
a lesser degree?  This He would do for two reasons.  The first is that
a psychic circle is a great source of strength to one who is himself
psychic, as is shown continually in our own experience, where, with a
sympathetic and helpful surrounding, an atmosphere is created where all
the powers are drawn out.  How sensitive Christ was to such an
atmosphere is shown by the remark of the Evangelist, that when He
visited His own native town, where the townspeople could not take Him
seriously, He was unable to do any wonders.  The second reason may have
been that He desired them to act as His deputies, either during his
lifetime or after His death, and that for this reason some natural
psychic powers were necessary.
