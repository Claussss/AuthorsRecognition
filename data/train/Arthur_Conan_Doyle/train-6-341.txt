An instant later the rock and his vague fear and all things else had
passed from his mind, for there, down the yellow sandy path, the setting
sun gleaming on her golden hair, her lithe figure bending and swaying
with every heave of the cantering horse, was none other than the same
fair Edith, whose face had come so often betwixt him and his sleep. His
blood rushed hot to his face at the sight, for fearless of all else, his
spirit was attracted and yet daunted by the delicate mystery of woman.
To his pure and knightly soul not Edith alone, but every woman, sat high
and aloof, enthroned and exalted, with a thousand mystic excellencies
and virtues which raised her far above the rude world of man. There
was joy in contact with them; and yet there was fear, fear lest his own
unworthiness, his untrained tongue or rougher ways should in some way
break rudely upon this delicate and tender thing. Such was his thought
as the white horse cantered toward him; but a moment later his vague
doubts were set at rest by the frank voice of the young girl, who waved
her whip in merry greeting.
