Peterson looked at his visitor with a very questioning eye. "Of course you shall sleep here if you wish.  I'll tell Mrs. Burney to
make up the spare bed.  Where are you off to now?" "Come up with me to the window that overlooks the door.  I want you to
see what I have seen." They went up to the window of the upper hall whence they could look
down upon the approach to the house.  The drive and the fields on
either side lay quiet and still, bathed in the peaceful moonlight.
