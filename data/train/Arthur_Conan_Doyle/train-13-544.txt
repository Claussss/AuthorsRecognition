      â€œTo this, of course, I assented, and the young man withdrew. The
      patient and I then plunged into a discussion of his case, of
      which I took exhaustive notes. He was not remarkable for
      intelligence, and his answers were frequently obscure, which I
      attributed to his limited acquaintance with our language.
      Suddenly, however, as I sat writing, he ceased to give any answer
      at all to my inquiries, and on my turning towards him I was
      shocked to see that he was sitting bolt upright in his chair,
      staring at me with a perfectly blank and rigid face. He was again
      in the grip of his mysterious malady.
