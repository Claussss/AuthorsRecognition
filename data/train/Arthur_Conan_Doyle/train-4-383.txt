‘Our lives are the stake,’ said I. ‘Faith, I had forgot it!’ he replied, still mumbling his toothpick. ‘“To
be or not to be?” as Will of Stratford says. Kynaston was great on the
passage. But here is the bell that rings the curtain up.’ Whilst we had been making our dispositions the troop of horse--for there
appeared to be but one--had trotted down the cross-road, and had drawn
up across the main highway. They numbered, as far as I could judge,
about ninety troopers, and it was evident from their three-cornered
hats, steel plates, red sleeves, and bandoliers, that they were dragoons
of the regular army. The main body halted a quarter of a mile from us,
while three officers rode to the front and held a short consultation,
which ended in one of them setting spurs to his horse and cantering down
in our direction. A bugler followed a few paces behind him, waving a
white kerchief and blowing an occasional blast upon his trumpet.
