“Tell us about Cadogan West.” “He has been ten years in the service and has done good work. He has
the reputation of being hot-headed and imperious, but a straight,
honest man. We have nothing against him. He was next Sidney Johnson in
the office. His duties brought him into daily, personal contact with
the plans. No one else had the handling of them.” “Who locked up the plans that night?” “Mr. Sidney Johnson, the senior clerk.”
