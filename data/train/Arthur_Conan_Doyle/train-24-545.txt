named an olla which is prepared there, though I have never been clear in
my mind as to whether it was but a ragout such as is to be found in the
south, or whether there is some seasoning such as fennel or garlic which
is peculiar to Spain.” “Your doubts, Sir Oliver, shall soon be resolved,” answered the prince,
laughing heartily, as did many of the barons who surrounded them. “His
majesty here will doubtless order that you have this dish hotly seasoned
when we are all safely in Castile.”
