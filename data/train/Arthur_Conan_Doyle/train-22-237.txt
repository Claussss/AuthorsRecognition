â€œWell, that was the situation. If I could lie low for a while and then
get away where I could be joined by my 'widow' we should have a chance
at last of living in peace for the rest of our lives. These devils would
give me no rest so long as I was above ground; but if they saw in the
papers that Baldwin had got his man, there would be an end of all my
troubles. I hadn't much time to make it all clear to Barker and to my
wife; but they understood enough to be able to help me. I knew all about
this hiding place, so did Ames; but it never entered his head to connect
it with the matter. I retired into it, and it was up to Barker to do the
rest.
