“It seems wilder and more savage than ever to-night,” remarked the
American. “It gives me the same feeling of pitiless force that the
Atlantic does upon a cold, dark, winter day. Perhaps it is the knowledge
that we are right there on the very edge of any kind of law and
order. How far do you suppose that we are from any Dervishes, Colonel
Cochrane?” “Well, on the Arabian side,” said the Colonel, “we have the Egyptian
fortified camp of Sarras about forty miles to the south of us. Beyond
that are sixty miles of very wild country before you would come to the
Dervish post at Akasheh. On this other side, however, there is nothing
between us and them.”
