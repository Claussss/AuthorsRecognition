With his arms round the robber's burly body and his face buried in his
bushy beard, Aylward gasped and strained and heaved. Back and forward
in the dusty road the two men stamped and staggered, a grim
wrestling-match, with life for the prize. Twice the great strength of
the outlaw had Aylward nearly down, and twice with his greater youth
and skill the archer restored his grip and his balance. Then at last
his turn came. He slipped his leg behind the other's knee, and, giving
a mighty wrench, tore him across it. With a hoarse shout the outlaw
toppled backward and had hardly reached the ground before Aylward
had his knee upon his chest and his short sword deep in his beard and
pointed to his throat.
