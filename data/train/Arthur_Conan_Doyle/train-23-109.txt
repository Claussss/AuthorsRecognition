I have myself been to Crewe and have had results which would be amazing
were it not that familiarity blunts the mind to miracles.  Three marked
plates brought by myself, and handled, developed and fixed by no hand
but mine, gave psychic extras.  In each case I saw the extra in the
negative when it was still wet in the dark room.  I reproduce in Plate
I a specimen of the results, which is enough in itself to prove the
whole case of survival to any reasonable mind.  The three sitters are
Mr. Oaten, Mr. Walker, and myself, I being obscured by the psychic
cloud.  In this cloud appears a message of welcome to me from the late
Archdeacon Colley.  A specimen of the Archdeacon's own handwriting is
reproduced in Plate II for the purpose of comparison.  Behind, there is
an attempt at materialisation obscured by the cloud.  The mark on the
side of the plate is my identification mark.  I trust that I make it
clear that no hand but mine ever touched this plate, nor did I ever
lose sight of it for a second save when it was in the carrier, which
was conveyed straight back to the dark room and there opened.  What has
any critic to say to that?
