"We don't want to break a record," said he, pulling up and panting
after attempting to keep up with Johnson for five minutes.  "I would go
quicker if I could, my dear sir, and I quite sympathise with your
anxiety, but really I can't manage it." So Johnson, on fire with impatience, had to slow down until they
reached the New North Road, when he ran ahead and had the door open for
the doctor when he came.  He heard the two meet outside the bed-room,
and caught scraps of their conversation.  "Sorry to knock you up--nasty
case--decent people."  Then it sank into a mumble and the door closed
behind them.
