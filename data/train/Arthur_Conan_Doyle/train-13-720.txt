      I met him accordingly next morning and we travelled down to
      Woking together. He had had no answer to his advertisement, he
      said, and no fresh light had been thrown upon the case. He had,
      when he so willed it, the utter immobility of countenance of a
      red Indian, and I could not gather from his appearance whether he
      was satisfied or not with the position of the case. His
      conversation, I remember, was about the Bertillon system of
      measurements, and he expressed his enthusiastic admiration of the
      French savant.
