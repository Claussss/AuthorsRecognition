“The ladies would say that a judgment hath fallen upon our good Sir
Hubert for his impious words,” said the King. “Let us hope that his charger may be broken in ere they venture to ride
out between two armies,” remarked the Prince. “They might mistake the
hardness of his horse's mouth for a softness of the rider's heart. See
where he rides, still clearing every bush upon his path.” “By the rood!” said the King, “if the bold Hubert has not increased his
repute as a jouster he has gained great honor as a horseman. But the
bridge is still closed, Walter. How say you now? Is this young Squire
never to be unhorsed, or is your King himself to lay lance in rest ere
his way can be cleared? By the head of Saint Thomas! I am in the very
mood to run a course with this gentle youth.”
