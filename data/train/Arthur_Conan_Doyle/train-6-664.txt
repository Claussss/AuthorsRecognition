“Who then are these people, and how do they live upon so small and
windswept an island?” asked the soldier. “They do not live from the island, fair sir, but from what they can
gather upon the sea around it. They are broken folk from all countries,
justice-fliers, prison-breakers, reavers, escaped bondsmen, murderers
and staff-strikers who have made their way to this outland place and
hold it against all comers. There is one here who could tell you of
them and of their ways, for he was long time prisoner amongst them.”
 The seaman pointed to Black Simon, the dark man from Norwich, who
was leaning against the side lost in moody thought and staring with a
brooding eye at the distant shore.
