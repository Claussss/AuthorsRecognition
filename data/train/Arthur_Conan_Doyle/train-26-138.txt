And then there is the vexed question of morals. Surely in talking
of this also there is a good deal of inverted cant among a certain
class of critics. The inference appears to be that there is some
subtle connection between immorality and art, as if the handling of
the lewd, or the depicting of it, were in some sort the hallmark of
the true artist. It is not difficult to handle or depict. On the
contrary, it is so easy, and so essentially dramatic in many of its
forms, that the temptation to employ it is ever present. It is the
easiest and cheapest of all methods of creating a spurious effect.
The difficulty does not lie in doing it. The difficulty lies in
avoiding it. But one tries to avoid it because on the face of it
there is no reason why a writer should cease to be a gentleman,
or that he should write for a woman's eyes that which he would be
justly knocked down for having said in a woman's ears. But "you
must draw the world as it is." Why must you? Surely it is just in
selection and restraint that the artist is shown. It is true that in
a coarser age great writers heeded no restrictions, but life itself
had fewer restrictions then. We are of our own age, and must live
up to it.
