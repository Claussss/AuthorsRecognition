“One thing comes back to my memory which may have a bearing upon the
business that you two gentlemen are investigating. I thought nothing of
it at the time. Near the end of dinner a note was handed in by the
servant. I noticed that after my host had read it he seemed even more
distrait and strange than before. He gave up all pretence at
conversation and sat, smoking endless cigarettes, lost in his own
thoughts, but he made no remark as to the contents. About eleven I was
glad to go to bed. Some time later Garcia looked in at my door—the room
was dark at the time—and asked me if I had rung. I said that I had not.
He apologised for having disturbed me so late, saying that it was
nearly one o’clock. I dropped off after this and slept soundly all
night.
