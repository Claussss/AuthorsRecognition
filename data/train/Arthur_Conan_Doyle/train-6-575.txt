“It makes a strange sound, archer, does it not?” said Nigel wistfully. “So I have heard, fair sir--even as the bow twangs, so it also has a
sound when you loose it.” “There is no one to hear, since we are alone upon the rampart, nor can
it do scathe, since it points to sea. I pray you to loose it and I will
listen to the sound.” He bent over the bombard with an attentive ear,
while Aylward, stooping his earnest brown face over the touch-hole,
scraped away diligently with a flint and steel. A moment later both he
and Nigel were seated some distance off upon the ground while amid the
roar of the discharge and the thick cloud of smoke they had a vision
of the long black snakelike engine shooting back upon the recoil. For a
minute or more they were struck motionless with astonishment while the
reverberations died away and the smoke wreaths curled slowly up to the
blue heavens.
