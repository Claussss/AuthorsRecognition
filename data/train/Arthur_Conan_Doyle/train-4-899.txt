‘Suppose I be the same? What then?’ the man asked sullenly. ‘There is no suppose in the matter. I could swear to you. But I would
not, lad--not if I caught you red-handed. You must know, Clarke, since
there is none to overhear us, that in the old days I was a Justice of
the Peace in Surrey, and that our friend here was brought up before me
on a charge of riding somewhat late o’ night, and of being plaguey short
with travellers. You will understand me. He was referred to assizes, but
got away in the meanwhile, and so saved his neck. Right glad I am of
it, for you will agree with me that he is too proper a man to give a
tight-rope dance at Tyburn.’
