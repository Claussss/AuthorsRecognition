‘My compliments to you, Captain Clarke,’ said the skipper, bobbing his
round bristling head. ‘An honest seaman’s compliments to you. It seems
that we are not to be shipmates this voyage, after all.’ ‘Captain Micah Clarke must do a voyage of his own,’ said the stranger. At the sound of his voice I sprang round in amazement. ‘Good Heavens!’ I
cried, ‘Saxon!’ ‘You have nicked it,’ said he, throwing down his mantle and showing the
well-known face and figure of the soldier of fortune. ‘Zounds, man! if
you can pick me out of the Solent, I suppose that I may pick you out of
this accursed rat-trap in which I find you. Tie and tie, as we say at
the green table. In truth, I was huffed with you when last we parted,
but I have had you in my mind for all that.’
