      shall be very glad to have you back safe and sound in Baker
      Street once more.” Baskerville Hall       Sir Henry Baskerville and Dr. Mortimer were ready upon the
      appointed day, and we started as arranged for Devonshire. Mr.
      Sherlock Holmes drove with me to the station and gave me his last
      parting injunctions and advice.
