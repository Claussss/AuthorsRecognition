“You show how little you know me. I have been very selfish and
thoughtless.” “At least you had no need for all these strong emotions. You were
sufficiently alive without them. Now it has been different with me.” “Why did you need emotions, Mr. Stephens'?” “Because anything is better than stagnation. Pain is better than
stagnation. I have only just begun to live. Hitherto I have been
a machine upon the earth's surface. I was a one-ideaed man, and a
one-ideaed man is only one remove from a dead man. That is what I
have only just begun to realise. For all these years I have never been
stirred, never felt a real throb of human emotion pass through me. I had
no time for it. I had observed it in others, and I had vaguely wondered
whether there was some want in me which prevented my sharing the
experience of my fellow-mortals. But now these last few days have
taught me how keenly I can live--that I can have warm hopes and deadly
fears--that I can hate and that I can--well, that I can have every
strong feeling which the soul can experience. I have come to life. I
may be on the brink of the grave, but at least I can say now that I have
lived.”
