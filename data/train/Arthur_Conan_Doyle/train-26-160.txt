A Briton cannot help asking himself, as he realizes what men these
were, what would have happened if 150,000 Cogniets and Bourgognes,
with Marbots to lead them, and the great captain of all time in the
prime of his vigour at their head, had made their landing in Kent?
For months it was touch-and-go. A single naval slip which left
the Channel clear would have been followed by an embarkation
from Boulogne, which had been brought by constant practice to so
incredibly fine a point that the last horse was aboard within two
hours of the start. Any evening might have seen the whole host
upon the Pevensey Flats. What then? We know what Humbert did with
a handful of men in Ireland, and the story is not reassuring.
Conquest, of course, is unthinkable. The world in arms could not do
that. But Napoleon never thought of the conquest of Britain. He has
expressly disclaimed it. What he did contemplate was a gigantic raid
in which he would do so much damage that for years to come England
would be occupied at home in picking up the pieces, instead of
having energy to spend abroad in thwarting his Continental plans.
