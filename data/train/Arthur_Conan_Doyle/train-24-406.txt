sword. “You ask me for a sign,” he said. “Here is a sign for you, since you
must have one.” As he spoke he whirled the covering from the object
in front of him and showed to their horror that it was a newly-severed
human leg. “By God's tooth!” he continued, with a brutal laugh, “you ask
me if I am a man of quarterings, and it is even so, for I am officer
to the verderer's court at Lyndhurst. This thievish leg is to hang at
Milton, and the other is already at Brockenhurst, as a sign to all men
of what comes of being over-fond of venison pasty.”
