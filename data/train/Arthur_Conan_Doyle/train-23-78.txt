As to the methods by which the early Christians communicated with the
spirits, or with the "Saints" as they called their dead brethren, we
have, so far as I know, no record, though the words of John:
"Brothers, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they
are of God," show very clearly that spirit communion was a familiar
idea, and also that they were plagued, as we are, by the intrusion of
unwelcome spiritual elements in their intercourse.  Some have
conjectured that the "Angel of the Church," who is alluded to in terms
which suggest that he was a human being, was really a medium sanctified
to the use of that particular congregation.  As we have early
indications of bishops, deacons and other officials, it is difficult to
say what else the "angel" could have been.  This, however, must remain
a pure speculation.
