II. HOW THE DEVIL CAME TO WAVERLEY 
The day was the first of May, which was the Festival of the Blessed
Apostles Philip and James. The year was the 1,349th from man's
salvation. From tierce to sext, and then again from sext to nones, Abbot John of
the House of Waverley had been seated in his study while he conducted
the many high duties of his office. All around for many a mile on every
side stretched the fertile and flourishing estate of which he was the
master. In the center lay the broad Abbey buildings, with church and
cloisters, hospitium, chapter-house and frater-house, all buzzing with a
busy life. Through the open window came the low hum of the voices of the
brethren as they walked in pious converse in the ambulatory below.
From across the cloister there rolled the distant rise and fall of a
Gregorian chant, where the precentor was hard at work upon the choir,
while down in the chapter-house sounded the strident voice of Brother
Peter, expounding the rule of Saint Bernard to the novices.
