April 26.  Ten days have elapsed since I have had the heart to make any
entry in my journal.  Why should I record my own humiliation and
degradation?  I had vowed never to open it again.  And yet the force of
habit is strong, and here I find myself taking up once more the record
of my own dreadful experiences--in much the same spirit in which a
suicide has been known to take notes of the effects of the poison which
killed him.
