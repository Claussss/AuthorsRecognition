lover to the door. In the dim light of the hall he could see their
figures and overhear their words. “Next time, little girl?” “Next time be it, Hector.” “And nothing can part us?” “In the whole world?” Robert discreetly closed the door. A moment later a thud from without,
and the quick footsteps crunching on the snow told him that their
visitor had departed.
