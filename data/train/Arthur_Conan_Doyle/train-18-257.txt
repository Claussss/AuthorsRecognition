It was hard to believe that the gentle breeze which whispered so softly
among the ivy-leaves around my window was caused by the same element
which had shaken the very house a few short hours before. It was as if
Nature had repented of her momentary passion and was endeavouring to
make amends to an injured world by its warmth and its sunshine. A chorus
of birds in the garden below filled the whole air with their wonder and
congratulations.
