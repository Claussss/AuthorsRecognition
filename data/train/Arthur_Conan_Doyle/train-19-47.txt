March 29.  Mesmerized again.  Details in Note-book A. March 30.  Sunday, and a blank day.  I grudge any interruption of our

Afterward we hope to pass on to the phenomena of suggestion and of
lucidity.  Professors have demonstrated these things upon women at
Nancy and at the Salpetriere.  It will be more convincing when a woman
demonstrates it upon a professor, with a second professor as a witness.
And that I should be the subject--I, the sceptic, the materialist!  At
least, I have shown that my devotion to science is greater than to my
own personal consistency.  The eating of our own words is the greatest
sacrifice which truth ever requires of us.
