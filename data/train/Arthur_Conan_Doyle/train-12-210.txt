“This is my treasure house,” remarked the owner. “You see that I have
rather an accumulation just now. My imports have been exceeding my
exports. You can understand that I have other and more important duties
even than the making of gold, just now. This is where I store my output
until I am ready to send it off. Every night almost I am in the habit of
sending a case of it to London. I employ seventeen brokers in its sale.
Each thinks that he is the only one, and each is dying to know where I
can get such large quantities of virgin gold. They say that it is the
purest which comes into the market. The popular theory is, I believe,
that I am a middleman acting on behalf of some new South African mine,
which wishes to keep its whereabouts a secret. What value would you put
upon the gold in this chamber? It ought to be worth something, for it
represents nearly a week's work.”
