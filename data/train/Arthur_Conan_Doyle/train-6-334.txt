So the armor was trussed upon the armorer's mule and went back with them
to Tilford, where Nigel put it on once more for the pleasure of the Lady
Ermyntrude, who clapped her skinny hands and shed tears of mingled pain
and joy--pain that she should lose him, joy that he should go so bravely
to the wars. As to her own future, it had been made easy for her, since
it was arranged that a steward should look to the Tilford estate whilst
she had at her disposal a suite of rooms in royal Windsor, where with
other venerable dames of her own age and standing she could spend the
twilight of her days discussing long-forgotten scandals and whispering
sad things about the grandfathers and the grandmothers of the young
courtiers all around them. There Nigel might leave her with an easy mind
when he turned his face to France.
