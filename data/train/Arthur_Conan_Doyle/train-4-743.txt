‘One which it would be better if I could deliver privately to your
Grace,’ I answered. ‘Ah, you are he who desired private audience? Well, Captain, these are
my council and they are as myself. So we may look upon ourselves as
alone. What I may hear they may hear. Zounds, man, never stammer and
boggle, but out with it!’ My request had roused the interest of the company, and those who were in
the window came over to the table. Nothing could have been worse for the
success of my mission, and yet there was no help for it but to deliver
my despatches. I can say with a clear conscience, without any vainglory,
that I had no fears for myself. The doing of my duty was the one thought
in my mind. And here I may say once for all, my dear children, that I am
speaking of myself all through this statement with the same freedom
as though it were another man. In very truth the strong active lad of
one-and-twenty _was_ another man from the grey-headed old fellow who
sits in the chimney corner and can do naught better than tell old tales
to the youngsters. Shallow water gives a great splash, and so a braggart
has ever been contemptible in my eyes. I trust, therefore, that ye will
never think that your grandad is singing his own praises, or setting
himself up as better than his neighbours. I do but lay the facts, as far
as I can recall them, before ye with all freedom and with all truth.
