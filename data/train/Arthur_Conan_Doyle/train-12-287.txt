   “MY DEAR ROBERT,--My secret shall never be used again. I cannot
   tell you how I thank Heaven that I did not entirely confide it to
   you, for I should have been handing over an inheritance of misery
   both to yourself and others.  For myself I have hardly had a happy
   moment since I discovered it. This I could have borne had I been
   able to feel that I was doing good, but, alas! the only effect of my
   attempts has been to turn workers into idlers, contented men into
   greedy parasites, and, worst of all, true, pure women into
   deceivers and hypocrites.  If this is the effect of my interference
   on a small scale, I cannot hope for anything better were I to carry
   out the plans which we have so often discussed.  The schemes of my
   life have all turned to nothing.  For myself, you shall never see me
   again.  I shall go back to the student life from which I emerged.
   There, at least, if I can do little good, I can do no harm.  It is
   my wish that such valuables as remain in the Hall should be sold,
   and the proceeds divided amidst all the charities of Birmingham.
   I shall leave tonight if I am well enough, but I have been much
   troubled all day by a stabbing pain in my side.  It is as if wealth
   were as bad for health as it is for peace of mind.  Good-bye,
   Robert, and may you never have as sad a heart as I have to-night.
   Yours very truly,
   RAFFLES HAW.”
