APPENDICES DOCTOR GELEY'S EXPERIMENTS 
Nothing could be imagined more fantastic and grotesque than the results
of the recent experiments of Professor Geley, in France.  Before such
results the brain, even of the trained psychical student, is dazed,
while that of the orthodox man of science, who has given no heed to
these developments, is absolutely helpless.  In the account of the
proceedings which he read lately before the Institut General
Psychologique in Paris, on January of last year, Dr. Geley says:  "I do
not merely say that there has been no fraud; I say, 'there has been no
possibility of fraud.'  In nearly every case the materialisations were
done under my eyes, and I have observed their whole genesis and
development."  He adds that, in the course of the experiments, more
than a hundred experts, mostly doctors, checked the results.
