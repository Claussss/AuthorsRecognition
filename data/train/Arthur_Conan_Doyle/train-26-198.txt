I wonder whether, at the time, the old Hainault Canon had any idea
of what he was doing--whether it ever flashed across his mind that
the day might come when his book would be the one great authority,
not only about the times in which he lived, but about the whole
institution of chivalry? I fear that it is far more likely that his
whole object was to gain some mundane advantage from the various
barons and knights whose names and deeds be recounts. He has left it
on record, for example, that when he visited the Court of England he
took with him a handsomely-bound copy of his work; and, doubtless,
if one could follow the good Canon one would find his journeys
littered with similar copies which were probably expensive gifts to
the recipient, for what return would a knightly soul make for a book
which enshrined his own valour?
