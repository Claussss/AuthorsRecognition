Never in all my experience had I known a day pass so slowly as did that
eventful 5th of October. In every possible manner I endeavoured to while
away the tedious hours, and yet it seemed as if darkness would never
arrive. I tried to read, I tried to write, I paced about the lawn, I walked to
the end of the lane, I put new flies upon my fishing-hooks, I began to
index my father's library--in a dozen ways I endeavoured to relieve the
suspense which was becoming intolerable. My sister, I could see, was
suffering from the same feverish restlessness.
