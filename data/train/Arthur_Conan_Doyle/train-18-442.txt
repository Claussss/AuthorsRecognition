The tortuous path grew less and less defined as we proceeded, and was
even covered in places with water, but the increasing excitement of the
hound and the sight of the deep footmarks in the mud stimulated us to
push on. At last, after struggling through a grove of high bulrushes,
we came on a spot the gloomy horror of which might have furnished Dante
with a fresh terror for his “Inferno.” The whole bog in this part appeared to have sunk in, forming a great,
funnel-shaped depression, which terminated in the centre in a circular
rift or opening about forty feet in diameter. It was a whirlpool--a
perfect maelstrom of mud, sloping down on every side to this silent and
awful chasm.
