"Well, we did it at night. Walker, of course, felt that it was something
of an experiment, and did not wish too much talk about it unless it
proved successful. There were half a dozen of us there, M'Namara and I
among the rest. The room was a small one, and in the centre was the
narrow table, with a mackintosh over the pillow, and a blanket which
extended almost to the floor on either side. Two candles, on a
side-table near the pillow, supplied all the light. In came the patient,
with one side of his face as smooth as a baby's, and the other all in a
quiver with fright. He lay down, and the chloroform towel was placed
over his face, while Walker threaded his needles in the candle light.
The chloroformist stood at the head of the table, and M'Namara was
stationed at the side to control the patient. The rest of us stood by to
assist.
