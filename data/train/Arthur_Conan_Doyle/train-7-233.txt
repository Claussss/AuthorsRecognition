“What have we promised you if we come back to Egypt?” asked Cochrane. “Two hundred Egyptian pounds and promotion in the army,--all upon the
word of an Englishman.” “Very good. Then you shall have three hundred each if you can make some
new plan by which you can take the women with you.” Tippy Tilly scratched his woolly head in his perplexity. “We might, indeed, upon some excuse, bring three more of the faster
camels round to this place. Indeed, there are three very good camels
among those which are near the cooking-fire. But how are we to get the
women upon them?--and if we had them upon them, we know very well that
they would fall off when they began to gallop. I fear that you men will
fall off, for it is no easy matter to remain upon a galloping camel; but
as to the women, it is impossible. No, we shall leave the women, and if
you will not leave the women, then we shall leave all of you and start
by ourselves.”
