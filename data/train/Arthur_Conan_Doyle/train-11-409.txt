“I regret it, sir,” said I; “but you have a cloak here and I must take
it.” He tried to rise from his chair and reach his sword, but I got between
him and the corner where it lay. “If there is anything in the pockets----” “A case,” said he. “I would not rob you,” said I; and raising the cloak I took from the
pockets a silver flask, a square wooden case and a field-glass. All
these I handed to him. The wretch opened the case, took out a pistol,
and pointed it straight at my head.
