      “‘We were returning from the Watt Street Mission about a quarter
      to nine o’clock. On our way we had to pass through Hudson Street,
      which is a very quiet thoroughfare. There is only one lamp in it,
      upon the left-hand side, and as we approached this lamp I saw a
      man coming towards us with his back very bent, and something like
      a box slung over one of his shoulders. He appeared to be
      deformed, for he carried his head low and walked with his knees
      bent. We were passing him when he raised his face to look at us
      in the circle of light thrown by the lamp, and as he did so he
      stopped and screamed out in a dreadful voice, “My God, it’s
      Nancy!” Mrs. Barclay turned as white as death, and would have
      fallen down had the dreadful-looking creature not caught hold of
      her. I was going to call for the police, but she, to my surprise,
      spoke quite civilly to the fellow.
