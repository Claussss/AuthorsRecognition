      “What have you done, Holmes?” I asked.       “A threadbare and venerable device, but useful upon occasion. I
      walked into the doctor’s yard this morning, and shot my syringe
      full of aniseed over the hind wheel. A draghound will follow
      aniseed from here to John o’Groat’s, and our friend, Armstrong,
      would have to drive through the Cam before he would shake Pompey
      off his trail. Oh, the cunning rascal! This is how he gave me the
      slip the other night.”
