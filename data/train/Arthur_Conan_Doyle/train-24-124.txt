“Would that cure the black death, master?” asked Jenkin. “Aye, truly would it, my fair son.” “Then I am right glad that there were none who knew of it. The black
death is the best friend that ever the common folk had in England.” “How that then?” asked Hordle John. “Why, friend, it is easy to see that you have not worked with your hands
or you would not need to ask. When half the folk in the country were
dead it was then that the other half could pick and choose who they
would work for, and for what wage. That is why I say that the murrain
was the best friend that the borel folk ever had.”
