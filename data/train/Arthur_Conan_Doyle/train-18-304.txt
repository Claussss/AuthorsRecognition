On observing me the priest sprang to his feet and greeted me with the
same lofty courtesy and dignified grace which had so impressed me the
day before. “I promised myself yesterday,” he said, “the pleasure of calling upon
your father. You see I have kept my word. I have even been daring enough
to question his views upon some points in connection with the Sanscrit
and Hindoo tongues, with the result that we have been arguing for
an hour or more without either of us convincing the other. Without
pretending to as deep a theoretical knowledge as that which has made the
name of James Hunter West a household word among Oriental scholars,
I happen to have given considerable attention to this one point, and
indeed I am in a position to say that I know his views to be unsound.
I assure you, sir, that up to the year 700, or even later, Sanscrit was
the ordinary language of the great bulk of the inhabitants of India.”
