have forgotten something.' 'Have you looked it over, sir?' 'I never trouble with the details. Please examine it.' 'There is no need, sir. I never make a mistake.' 'I said, Mrs. Elderfield, please _examine_ it.' She seemed to hesitate, but obeyed. 'The bill is quite correct, sir.' 'Thank you.' He paid it at once and said no more.
