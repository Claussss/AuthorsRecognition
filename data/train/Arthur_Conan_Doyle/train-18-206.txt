â€œGabriel says that she has explained to you that the governor is always
a changed man after this particular date, on which his fears reach a
crisis. He apparently has more reason than usual this year to anticipate
that trouble is brewing for this unfortunate family, for I have never
known him to take so many elaborate precautions or appear so thoroughly
unnerved. Who would ever think, to see his bent form and his shaking
hands, that he is the same man who used some few short years ago to
shoot tigers on foot among the jungles of the Terai, and would laugh at
the more timid sportsmen who sought the protection of their elephant's
howdah?
