But if the recluse's wealth was a lure which drew the beggars from
far and near, as the lamp draws the moths, it had the same power of
attraction upon another and much more dangerous class. Strange hard
faces were seen in the village street, prowling figures were marked at
night stealing about among the fir plantations, and warning messages
arrived from city police and county constabulary to say that evil
visitors were known to have taken train to Tamfield. But if, as Raffles
Haw held, there were few limits to the power of immense wealth, it
possessed, among other things, the power of self-preservation, as one or
two people were to learn to their cost.
