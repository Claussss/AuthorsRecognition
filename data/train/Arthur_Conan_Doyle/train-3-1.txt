     of faith. 'The Vital Message' seeks to show our future relations
     with the Unseen World."--DAILY CHRONICLE. "... it is a clear,
     earnest presentation of the case, and will serve as a useful
     introduction to the subject to anyone anxious to learn what the new

     system, with much broad-mindedness and toleration."--DAILY

     telling and racy style, and one that will add to his prestige and
