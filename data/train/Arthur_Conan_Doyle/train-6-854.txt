“Welcome, Robert, so long as you are beneath this roof,” said he.
“Perhaps the time may come in another place when we may speak to each
other in another fashion.” “So I hope, Richard,” said Beaumanoir; “but indeed we of Josselin bear
you in high esteem and are much beholden to you and to your men for all
that you have done for us. We could not wish better neighbors nor any
from whom more honor is to be gained. I learn that Sir Robert Knolles
and others have joined you, and we are heavy-hearted to think that the
orders of our Kings should debar us from attempting a venture.” He
and his squire sat down at the places set for them, and filling their
glasses drank to the company.
