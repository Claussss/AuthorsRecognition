In one respect these knights differ from anything which we have had
presented to us in our historical romances. To turn to the supreme
romancer, you will find that Scott's mediaeval knights were
usually muscular athletes in the prime of life: Bois-Guilbert,
Front-de-Boeuf, Richard, Ivanhoe, Count Robert--they all were
such. But occasionally the most famous of Froissart's knights were
old, crippled and blinded. Chandos, the best lance of his day, must
have been over seventy when he lost his life through being charged
upon the side on which he had already lost an eye. He was well on to
that age when he rode out from the English army and slew the Spanish
champion, big Marten Ferrara, upon the morning of Navaretta. Youth
and strength were very useful, no doubt, especially where heavy
armour had to be carried, but once on the horse's back the gallant
steed supplied the muscles. In an English hunting-field many a
doddering old man, when he is once firmly seated in his familiar
saddle, can give points to the youngsters at the game. So it was
among the knights, and those who had outlived all else could still
carry to the wars their wiliness, their experience with arms, and,
above all, their cool and undaunted courage.
