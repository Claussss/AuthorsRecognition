All round the walls and in the corners were arranged a very choice and
varied collection of arms, principally swords, some of which were of
the straight pattern in common use in the British Army, while among
the others were scimitars, tulwars, cuchurries, and a score of other
specimens of Oriental workmanship. Many of these were richly mounted,
with inlaid sheaths and hilts sparkling with precious stones, so that
there was a piquant contrast between the simplicity of the apartment and
the wealth which glittered on the walls.
