Slowly they moved at first, walking their horses that they might be the
fresher for the shock. Then they broke into a trot which was quickening
into a gallop when the remains of the hedge in front of them was
beaten in an instant to the ground and the broad line of the steel-clad
chivalry of England swept grandly forth to the final shock. With loose
rein and busy spur the two lines of horsemen galloped at the top of
their speed straight and hard for each other. An instant later they
met with a thunder-crash which was heard by the burghers on the wall of
Poitiers, seven good miles away.
