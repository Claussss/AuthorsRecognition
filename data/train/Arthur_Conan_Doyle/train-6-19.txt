But the true glory of the Cistercian lay in his outdoor work, and so
ever and anon there passed through the cloister some sunburned monk,
soiled mattock or shovel in hand, with his gown looped to his knee,
fresh from the fields or the garden. The lush green water-meadows
speckled with the heavy-fleeced sheep, the acres of corn-land reclaimed
from heather and bracken, the vineyards on the southern slope of
Crooksbury Hill, the rows of Hankley fish-ponds, the Frensham marshes
drained and sown with vegetables, the spacious pigeon-cotes, all circled
the great Abbey round with the visible labors of the Order.
