The table manners of our ancestors at this period would have furnished
to the modern eye the strangest mixture of luxury and of barbarism.
Forks were still unknown, and the courtesy fingers, the index and
the middle of the left hand, took their place. To use any others was
accounted the worst of manners. A crowd of dogs lay among the rushes
growling at each other and quarreling over the gnawed bones which were
thrown to them by the feasters. A slice of coarse bread served usually
as a plate, but the King's own high table was provided with silver
platters, which were wiped by the Squire or page after each course. On
the other hand the table-linen was costly, and the courses, served with
a pomp and dignity now unknown, comprised such a variety of dishes and
such complex marvels of cookery as no modern banquet could show. Besides
all our domestic animals and every kind of game, such strange delicacies
as hedgehogs, bustards, porpoises, squirrels, bitterns and cranes lent
variety to the feast.
