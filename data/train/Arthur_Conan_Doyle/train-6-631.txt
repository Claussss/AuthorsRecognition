on their lives to make no sound! You also, Loring. Go to the afterguard

hearing the cymbals clashing all round them, for in this way the
Spaniards held themselves together. Once the wild music came from above
their very prow, and so warned them to change their course. Once also
a huge vessel loomed for an instant upon their quarter, but they turned
two points away from her, and she blurred and vanished. Soon the cymbals
were but a distant tinkling, and at last they died gradually away.
