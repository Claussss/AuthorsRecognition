Mr. Summerlee:  "Yes, I will."  (Great cheering.) Professor Challenger:  "Then I guarantee that I will place in your

should have one or more with him who may check his.  I will not
disguise from you that there are difficulties and dangers.  Mr.
Summerlee will need a younger colleague.  May I ask for volunteers?"
