was ready at his horse's head, and the group of knights were out and

riding very swiftly hitherwards.” “Yet they must be from the prince's army,” remarked Sir Richard Causton,
“for they come from the north.” “Nay,” said the Earl of Angus, “it is not so certain; for the peasant
with whom we spoke last night said that it was rumored that Don Tello,
the Spanish king's brother, had ridden with six thousand chosen men to
beat up the prince's camp. It may be that on their backward road they
have come this way.”
