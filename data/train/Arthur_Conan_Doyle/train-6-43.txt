Fetlock deep in the lush grass there stood a magnificent horse, such a
horse as a sculptor or a soldier might thrill to see. His color was a
light chestnut, with mane and tail of a more tawny tint. Seventeen hands
high, with a barrel and haunches which bespoke tremendous strength, he
fined down to the most delicate lines of dainty breed in neck and crest
and shoulder. He was indeed a glorious sight as he stood there, his
beautiful body leaning back from his wide-spread and propped fore
legs, his head craned high, his ears erect, his mane bristling, his red
nostrils opening and shutting with wrath, and his flashing eyes turning
from side to side in haughty menace and defiance.
