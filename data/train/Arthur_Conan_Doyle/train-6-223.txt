“I should be shamed forever if I were to treat you so badly,” said
Nigel. “You have spoken me fair, and I would not grind you down.
Therefore, I will gladly take one hundred--” “And fifty,” whispered Aylward. “And fifty,” said Nigel. “By Saint John of Beverley!” cried the merchant. “I came hither from the
North Country, and they are said to be shrewd at a deal in those parts;
but I had rather bargain with a synagogue full of Jews than with you,
for all your gentle ways. Will you indeed take no less than a hundred
and fifty? Alas! you pluck from me my profits of a month. It is a fell
morning's work for me. I would I had never seen you!” With groans and
lamentations he paid the gold pieces across the counter, and Nigel,
hardly able to credit his own good fortune, gathered them into the
leather saddle-bag.
