‘Ahoy, there!’ he shouted, leaning over the taffrail. ‘What lugger is
that?’ ‘The _Lucy_,’ answered the mate, ‘bound from Porlock Quay to Bristol
with hides and tallow. Stand ready to tack!’ he added in a lower voice,
‘the fog is coming down again.’ ‘Ye have one of the hides with the horse still in it,’ cried the
officer. ‘Run down under our counter. We must have a closer look at ye.’ ‘Aye, aye, sir!’ said the mate, and putting his helm hard down the boom
swung across, and the _Maria_ darted off like a scared seabird into the
fog. Looking back there was nothing but a dim loom to show where we had
left the great vessel. We could hear, however, the hoarse shouting of
orders and the bustle of men.
