“I pray you,” said Nigel, “to tell me who you are and why you blow upon
this trumpet.” The fellow shook his head, so Nigel repeated the question in French, the
common language of chivalry, spoken at that age by every gentleman in
Western Europe. The man put his lips to the trumpet and blew another long note before he
answered. “I am Gaston de Castrier,” said he, “the humble Squire of
the most worthy and valiant knight Raoul de Tubiers, de Pestels, de
Grimsard, de Mersac, de Leoy, de Bastanac, who also writes himself Lord
of Pons. It is his order that I ride always a mile in front of him to
prepare all to receive him, and he desires me to blow upon a trumpet not
out of vainglory, but out of greatness of spirit, so that none may be
ignorant of his coming should they desire to encounter him.”
