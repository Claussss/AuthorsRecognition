He saw no longer where he placed his feet, he cared no longer whither he
went, but his one mad longing was to get away from this dreadful thing,
this torture which clung to him and would not let him go. Through
Thursley village he passed, his eyes straining in his agony, his heart
bursting within him, and he had won his way to the crest of Thursley
Down, still stung forward by stab and blow, when his spirit weakened,
his giant strength ebbed out of him, and with one deep sob of agony the
yellow horse sank among the heather. So sudden was the fall that Nigel
flew forward over his shoulder, and beast and man lay prostrate and
gasping while the last red rim of the sun sank behind Butser and the
first stars gleamed in a violet sky.
