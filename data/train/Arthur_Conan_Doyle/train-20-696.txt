      Holmes laughed at the young giant’s naïve astonishment.       “You live in a different world to me, Mr. Overton—a sweeter and
      healthier one. My ramifications stretch out into many sections of
      society, but never, I am happy to say, into amateur sport, which
      is the best and soundest thing in England. However, your
      unexpected visit this morning shows me that even in that world of
      fresh air and fair play, there may be work for me to do. So now,
      my good sir, I beg you to sit down and to tell me, slowly and
      quietly, exactly what it is that has occurred, and how you desire
      that I should help you.”
