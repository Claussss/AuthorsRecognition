“And a passing strange sword it is,” quoth Sir Nigel. “What make you,
Alleyne, of these black lines which are drawn across the sheath?” “I cannot tell what they are, my fair lord.” “Nor can I,” said Ford. The merchant chuckled to himself. “It was a thought of mine own,”
 said he; “for the sword was made by Thomas Wilson, the armorer, who is
betrothed to my second daughter Margery. Know then that the sheath is
one cloth-yard, in length, marked off according to feet and inches to
serve me as a measuring wand. It is also of the exact weight of two
pounds, so that I may use it in the balance.”
