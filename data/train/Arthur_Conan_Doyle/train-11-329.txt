“What's this?” said a gruff voice at my elbow; and I turned to face the
huge, black-bearded Dragoon who had dragged me from my saddle. “Look at
the Frenchman crying! I thought that the Corsican was followed by brave
men and not by children.” “If you and I were face to face and alone, I should let you see which is
the better man,” said I. For answer the brute struck me across the face with his open hand. I
seized him by the throat, but a dozen of his soldiers tore me away from
him, and he struck me again while they held my hands.
