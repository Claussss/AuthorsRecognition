“Oh, hush, Mr. McMurdo, don't speak so!” said the girl. “I have told
you, have I not, that you are too late? There is another, and if I have
not promised to marry him at once, at least I can promise no one else.” “Suppose I had been first, Ettie, would I have had a chance?” The girl sank her face into her hands. “I wish to heaven that you had
been first!” she sobbed. McMurdo was down on his knees before her in an instant. “For God's sake,
Ettie, let it stand at that!” he cried. “Will you ruin your life and
my own for the sake of this promise? Follow your heart, acushla! 'Tis a
safer guide than any promise before you knew what it was that you were
saying.”
