“By Saint Paul!” said he, “I never thought to find honorable advancement
under the roof of an abbey, but perchance there may, be some room for it
ere you hale me to your prison.” The chapter-house was in an uproar. Never in the long and decorous
history of the Abbey had such a scene been witnessed within its walls.
The monks themselves seemed for an instant to be infected by this spirit
of daring revolt. Their own lifelong fetters hung more loosely as they
viewed this unheard-of defiance of authority. They broke from their
seats on either side and huddled half-scared, half-fascinated, in a
large half-circle round the defiant captive, chattering, pointing,
grimacing, a scandal for all time. Scourges should fall and penance be
done for many a long week before the shadow of that day should pass from
Waverley. But meanwhile there was no effort to bring them back to their
rule. Everything was chaos and disorder. The Abbot had left his seat of
justice and hurried angrily forward, to be engulfed and hustled in the
crowd of his own monks like a sheep-dog who finds himself entangled amid
a flock.
