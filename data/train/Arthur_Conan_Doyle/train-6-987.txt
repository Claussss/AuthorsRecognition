For five minutes the long straining ranks faced each other with fierce
stab of spear on one side and heavy beat of ax or mace upon the other.
In many parts the hedge was pierced or leveled to the ground, and the
French men-at-arms were raging amongst the archers, hacking and hewing
among the lightly armed men. For a moment it seemed as if the battle was
on the turn. But John de Vere, Earl of Oxford, cool, wise and crafty in war, saw and
seized his chance. On the right flank a marshy meadow skirted the river.
So soft was it that a heavily-armed man would sink to his knees. At his
order a spray of light bowmen was thrown out from the battle line and
forming upon the flank of the French poured their arrows into them. At
the same moment Chandos, with Audley, Nigel, Bartholomew Burghersh, the
Captal de Buch, and a score of other knights sprang upon their horses,
and charging down the narrow lane rode over the French line in front of
them. Once through it they spurred to left and right, trampling down the
dismounted men-at-arms.
