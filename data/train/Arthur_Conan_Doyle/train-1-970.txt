This was fought on October 24th at a spot near Kleinfontein, upon the
Great Marico River, which runs to the north-east of Zeerust. Von Donop's
column was straggling through very broken and bush-covered country when
it was furiously charged in the flank and rear by two separate bodies
of burghers. Kemp, who commanded the flank attack, cut into the line of
wagons and destroyed eight of them, killing many of the Kaffir drivers,
before he could be driven off. De la Rey and Steenkamp, who rushed the
rear-guard, had a more desperate contest. The Boer horsemen got among
the two guns of the 4th R.F.A., and held temporary possession of them,
but the small escort were veterans of the 'Fighting Fifth,' who lived
up to the traditions of their famous north-country regiment. Of the
gun crews of the section, amounting to about twenty-six men, the young
officer, Hill, and sixteen men were hit. Of the escort of Northumberland
Fusiliers hardly a man was left standing, and forty-one of the
supporting Yeomanry were killed and wounded. It was for some little
time a fierce and concentrated struggle at the shortest of ranges. The
British horsemen came galloping to the rescue, however, and the attack
was finally driven back into that broken country from which it had
come. Forty dead Boers upon the ground, with their brave chieftain,
Ouisterhuisen, amongst them, showed how manfully the attack had been
driven home. The British losses were twenty-eight killed and fifty-six
wounded. Somewhat mauled, and with eight missing wagons, the small
column made its way back to Zeerust.
