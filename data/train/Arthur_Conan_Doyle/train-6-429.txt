“Nay, my dear and most sweet lady, how should you abate it, since it is
the thought of you which will nerve my arm and uphold my heart?” “Think once more, my fair lord, and hold yourself bound by no word which
you have said. Let it be as the breeze which blows past our faces and
is heard of no more. Your soul yearns for honor. To that has it ever
turned. Is there room in it for love also? or is it possible that both
shall live at their highest in one mind? Do you not call to mind that
Galahad and other great knights of old have put women out of their lives
that they might ever give their whole soul and strength to the winning
of honor? May it not be that I shall be a drag upon you, that your heart
may shrink from some honorable task, lest it should bring risk and pain
to me? Think well before you answer, my fair lord, for indeed my very
heart would break if it should ever happen that through love of me your
high hopes and great promise should miss fulfilment.”
