A slight breeze blew from the eastward, and the highended, round-bodied
craft rolled slowly down the Channel. The mist rose a little at times,
so that they had sight of each other dipping and rising upon a sleek,
oily sea, but again it would sink down, settling over the top, shrouding
the great yard, and finally frothing over the deck until even the water
alongside had vanished from their view and they were afloat on a little
raft in an ocean of vapor. A thin cold rain was falling, and the archers
were crowded under the shelter of the overhanging poop and forecastle,
where some spent the hours at dice, some in sleep, and many in trimming
their arrows or polishing their weapons.
