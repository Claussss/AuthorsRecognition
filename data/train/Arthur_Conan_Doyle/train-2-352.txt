“Well, what do you want?” she asked sharply, peering at us through the
darkness. “I want to speak to Dr. Shlessinger,” said Holmes. “There is no such person here,” she answered, and tried to close the
door, but Holmes had jammed it with his foot. “Well, I want to see the man who lives here, whatever he may call
himself,” said Holmes firmly. She hesitated. Then she threw open the door. “Well, come in!” said she.
“My husband is not afraid to face any man in the world.” She closed the
door behind us and showed us into a sitting-room on the right side of
the hall, turning up the gas as she left us. “Mr. Peters will be with
you in an instant,” she said.
