Whilst these high events had been in progress, Nigel with Black Simon
and four other men-at-arms from Bordeaux, was hastening northward to
join the army. As far as Bergerac they were in a friendly land, but
thence onward they rode over a blackened landscape with many a roofless
house, its two bare gable-ends sticking upward--a “Knolles' miter” as
it was afterward called when Sir Robert worked his stern will upon the
country. For three days they rode northward, seeing many small parties
of French in all directions, but too eager to reach the army to ease
their march in the search of adventures.
