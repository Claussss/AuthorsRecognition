“Lieutenant Heatherstone,” he answered, speaking slowly and gravely,
“you have committed this day the foulest sacrilege and the greatest
crime which it is possible for man to do. You have slain one of the
thrice blessed and reverend ones, an arch adept of the first degree, an
elder brother who has trod the higher path for more years than you
have numbered months. You have cut him off at a time when his labours
promised to reach a climax and when he was about to attain a height of
occult knowledge which would have brought man one step nearer to his
Creator. All this you have done without excuse, without provocation, at
a time when he was pleading the cause of the helpless and distressed.
Listen now to me, John Heatherstone.
