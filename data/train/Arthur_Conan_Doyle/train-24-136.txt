into the room, each bearing a huge bundle upon his head. They formed in
military line, while the soldier stood in front of them with stern eyes,
checking off their several packages. “Number one--a French feather-bed with the two counter-panes of white
sendall,” said he. “Here, worthy sir,” answered the first of the bearers, laying a great
package down in the corner.
