The use of novel and piquant forms of speech is one of the most
obvious of Stevenson's devices. No man handles his adjectives with
greater judgment and nicer discrimination. There is hardly a page
of his work where we do not come across words and expressions which
strike us with a pleasant sense of novelty, and yet express the
meaning with admirable conciseness. "His eyes came coasting round
to me." It is dangerous to begin quoting, as the examples are
interminable, and each suggests another. Now and then he misses his
mark, but it is very seldom. As an example, an "eye-shot" does not
commend itself as a substitute for "a glance," and "to tee-hee" for
"to giggle" grates somewhat upon the ear, though the authority of
Chaucer might be cited for the expressions.
