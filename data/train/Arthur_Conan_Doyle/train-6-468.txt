“Just one hour, most fair sir, just one hour at the longest, and a poor
Squire of England shall ever hold himself your debtor! Do but condescend
to rein your horse until my harness comes back to me! Will you not stoop
to show me some small deed of arms? I implore you, fair sir, to spare me
a little of your time and a handstroke or two ere you go upon your way!” Lord de Pons motioned impatiently with his gauntleted hand, as one might
brush away an importunate fly, but when at last Nigel became desperate
in his clamor he thrust his spurs into his great war-horse, and clashing
like a pair of cymbals he thundered off through the forest. So he
rode upon his majestic way, until two days later he was slain by Lord
Reginald Cobham in a field near Weybridge.
