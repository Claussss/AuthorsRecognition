It was just after lunch, and I was smoking a cigarette in my study,
when I heard the step of my servant Murray in the passage.  I was
languidly conscious that a second step was audible behind, and had
hardly troubled myself to speculate who it might be, when suddenly a
slight noise brought me out of my chair with my skin creeping with
apprehension.  I had never particularly observed before what sort of
sound the tapping of a crutch was, but my quivering nerves told me that
I heard it now in the sharp wooden clack which alternated with the
muffled thud of the foot fall.  Another instant and my servant had
shown her in.
