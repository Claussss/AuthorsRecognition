“Self-protection is no murder, anyhow,” said McMurdo, smiling grimly.
“It's him or us. I guess this man would destroy us all if we left
him long in the valley. Why, Brother Morris, we'll have to elect you
Bodymaster yet; for you've surely saved the lodge.” And yet it was clear from his actions that he thought more seriously
of this new intrusion than his words would show. It may have been his
guilty conscience, it may have been the reputation of the Pinkerton
organization, it may have been the knowledge that great, rich
corporations had set themselves the task of clearing out the Scowrers;
but, whatever his reason, his actions were those of a man who is
preparing for the worst. Every paper which would incriminate him was
destroyed before he left the house. After that he gave a long sigh of
satisfaction; for it seemed to him that he was safe. And yet the danger
must still have pressed somewhat upon him; for on his way to the lodge
he stopped at old man Shafter's. The house was forbidden him; but
when he tapped at the window Ettie came out to him. The dancing Irish
deviltry had gone from her lover's eyes. She read his danger in his
earnest face.
