“Draw them on, my fair lord! Draw them on until we have them out on the
down!” cried Aylward, his eyes shining with joy. “Five hundred paces
more, and then we may be on terms with them. Nay, linger not, but keep
them always just clear of arrowshot until our turn has come.” Nigel shook and trembled with eagerness, as with his hand on his
sword-hilt he looked at the line of eager hurrying men. But it flashed
through his mind what Chandos had said of the cool head which is better
for the warrior than the hot heart. Aylward's words were true and wise.
He turned Pommers' head therefore, and amid a cry of derision from
behind them the comrades trotted over the down. The bowmen broke into
a run, while their leader screamed and waved more madly than before.
Aylward cast many a glance at them over his shoulder.
