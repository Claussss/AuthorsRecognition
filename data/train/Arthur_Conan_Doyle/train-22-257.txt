extraordinary vehemence with which their friendly advances had been
rejected. “No offense, stranger,” said one. “It was a warning for your own good,
seeing that you are, by your own showing, new to the place.” “I'm new to the place; but I'm not new to you and your kind!” cried
McMurdo in cold fury. “I guess you're the same in all places, shoving
your advice in when nobody asks for it.”
