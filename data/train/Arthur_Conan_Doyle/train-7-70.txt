The Oxford man laughed in his gentle, tired fashion. “They are starting again,” said he, and the two hastened forwards to
take their places at the tail of the absurd procession. Their route ran now among large, scattered boulders, and between stony,
shingly hills. A narrow, winding path curved in and out amongst the
rocks. Behind them their view was cut off by similar hills, black and
fantastic, like the slag-heaps at the shaft of a mine. A silence fell
upon the little company, and even Sadie's bright face reflected the
harshness of Nature. The escort had closed in, and marched beside them,
their boots scrunching among the loose black rubble. Colonel Cochrane
and Belmont were still riding together in the van.
