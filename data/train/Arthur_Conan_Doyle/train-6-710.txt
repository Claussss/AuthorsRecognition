countryfolk at peace?” The leader of the archers, old Wat of Carlisle, held up a sword, a
girdle and a dagger. “If it please you, fair sir,” said he, “I saw the
glint of these, and I thought them no fit tools for hands which were
made for the spade and the plow. But when we had ridden them down and
taken them, there was the Bentley cross upon each, and we knew that they
had belonged to yonder dead Englishman upon the road. Surely then, these
are two of the villains who have slain him, and it is right that we do
justice upon them.”
