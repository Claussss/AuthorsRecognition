It may be remarked that in Monmouth’s commission to be general, dated
April 1668, he is styled ‘our most entirely beloved and natural son.’
Again, in a commission for the government of Hull, April 1673, he is
‘our well-beloved natural son.’ 
Note I.--Dragooners and Chargers. The dragoons, being really mounted infantry, were provided with very
inferior animals to the real cavalry. From a letter of Cromwell’s
[‘Squire Correspondence,’ April 3, 1643), it will be seen that a
dragooner was worth twenty pieces, while a charger could not be obtained
under sixty.
