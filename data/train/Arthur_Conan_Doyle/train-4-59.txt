‘We heard a shot aboard of the brig,’ said Reuben. ‘That was my brother Nonus shooting at me,’ the stranger observed,
shaking his head sadly. ‘But there was a second shot.’ ‘Ah, that was me shooting at my brother Nonus.’ ‘Good lack!’ I cried. ‘I trust that thou hast done him no hurt.’ ‘But a flesh wound, at the most,’ he answered. ‘I thought it best to
come away, however, lest the affair grow into a quarrel. I am sure that
it was he who trained the nine-pounder on me when I was in the water.
It came near enough to part my hair. He was always a good shot with a
falconet or a mortar-piece. He could not have been hurt, however, to get
down from the poop to the main-deck in the time.’
