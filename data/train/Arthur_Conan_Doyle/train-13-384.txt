      â€œOf course the calculation now was a simple one. If a rod of six
      feet threw a shadow of nine, a tree of sixty-four feet would
      throw one of ninety-six, and the line of the one would of course
      be the line of the other. I measured out the distance, which
      brought me almost to the wall of the house, and I thrust a peg
      into the spot. You can imagine my exultation, Watson, when within
      two inches of my peg I saw a conical depression in the ground. I
      knew that it was the mark made by Brunton in his measurements,
      and that I was still upon his trail.
