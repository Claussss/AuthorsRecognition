Nigel and his companions lined the ramparts of the castle and waved
their caps as the bluff, burly vessels, with drums beating and trumpets
clanging, a hundred knightly pennons streaming from their decks and the
red cross of England over all, rolled slowly out to the open sea. Then
when they had watched them until they were hull down they turned, with
hearts heavy at being left behind, to make ready for their own more
distant venture.
