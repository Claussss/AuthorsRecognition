“Surely we can, at least, take you from this island, and no such change
can be for the worse.” “Nay,” said she, “the saints in Heaven cannot help me now until they
take me to my rest. There is no place for me in the world beyond, and
all my friends were slain on the day I was taken. Leave me, brave men,
and let me care for myself. Already it lightens in the east, and black
will be your fate if you are taken. Go, and may the blessing of one who
was once a holy nun go with you and guard you from danger!”
