Besides all these a constant stream of strange vagabonds drifted along
the road: minstrels who wandered from fair to fair, a foul and pestilent
crew; jugglers and acrobats, quack doctors and tooth-drawers, students
and beggars, free workmen in search of better wages, and escaped
bondsmen who would welcome any wages at all. Such was the throng which
set the old road smoking in a haze of white dust from Winchester to the
narrow sea.
