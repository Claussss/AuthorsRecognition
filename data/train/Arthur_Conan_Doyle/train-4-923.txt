dead-coloured plain, which extended from the other side of the winding
Parret to the distant Polden Hills. ‘I can see them over yonder in the
direction of Westonzoyland, as bright as the poppies among corn.’ ‘There are more upon the left, near Chedzoy,’ quoth Sir Gervas. ‘One,
two, three, and one yonder, and two others behind--six regiments of foot
in all. Methinks I see the breastplates of horse over there, and some
sign of ordnance too. Faith! Monmouth must fight now, if he ever hopes
to feel the gold rim upon his temples. The whole of King James’s army
hath closed upon him.’
