  "What a strange appearance had those mighty casernes, with
  their blank, blind walls, without windows or grating, and
  their slanting roofs, out of which, through orifices where
  the tiles had been removed, would be protruded dozens of
  grim heads, feasting their prison-sick eyes on the wide
  expanse of country unfolded from their airy height. Ah!
  there was much misery in those casernes; and from those
  roofs, doubtless, many a wistful look was turned in the
  direction of lovely France. Much had the poor inmates to
  endure, and much to complain of, to the disgrace of England
  be it said--of England, in general so kind and bountiful.
  Rations of carrion meat, and bread from which I have seen
  the very hounds occasionally turn away, were unworthy
  entertainment even for the most ruffian enemy, when helpless
  and captive; and such, alas! was the fare in those casernes.
  And then, those visits, or rather ruthless inroads, called
  in the slang of the place 'straw-plait hunts,' when in
  pursuit of a contraband article, which the prisoners,
  in order to procure themselves a few of the necessaries
  and comforts of existence, were in the habit of making,
  red-coated battalions were marched into the prisons, who,
  with the bayonet's point, carried havoc and ruin into every
  poor convenience which ingenious wretchedness had been
  endeavouring to raise around it; and then the triumphant
  exit with the miserable booty, and worst of all, the accursed
  bonfire, on the barrack parade of the plait contraband,
  beneath the view of glaring eyeballs from those lofty roofs,
  amid the hurrahs of the troops frequently drowned in the
  curses poured down from above like a tempest-shower, or in
  the terrific war-whoop of 'Vive l'Empereur!'"
