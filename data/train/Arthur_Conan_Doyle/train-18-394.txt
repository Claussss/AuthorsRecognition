At last we came in sight of the place. A great pile of boulders was
heaped up at the very end of the pass, and among these our fugitives
were skulking, entirely demoralised apparently, and incapable of
resistance. They were useless as prisoners, and it was out of the
question to let them go, so there was no choice but to polish them off. Waving my sword, I was leading my men on, when we had a most dramatic
interruption of a sort which I have seen once or twice on the boards of
Drury Lane, but never in real life.
