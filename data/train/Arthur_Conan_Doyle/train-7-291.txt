The Colonel and the three women gave one backward glance when they came
to the edge of the oasis. Between the straight stems of the palms they
saw the gleam of the fire, and above the group of Arabs they caught a
last glimpse of the three white hats. An instant later, the camels began
to trot, and when they looked back once more the palm grove was only a
black clump with the vague twinkle of a light somewhere in the heart of
it. As with yearning eyes they gazed at that throbbing red point in the
darkness, they passed over the edge of the depression, and in an instant
the huge, silent, moonlit desert was round them without a sign of the
oasis which they had left. On every side the velvet, blue-black sky,
with its blazing stars, sloped downwards to the vast, dun-coloured
plain. The two were blurred into one at their point of junction.
