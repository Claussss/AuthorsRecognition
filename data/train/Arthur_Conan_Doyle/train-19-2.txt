No doubt I am a materialist.  Agatha says that I am a rank one.  I tell
her that is an excellent reason for shortening our engagement, since I
am in such urgent need of her spirituality.  And yet I may claim to be
a curious example of the effect of education upon temperament, for by
nature I am, unless I deceive myself, a highly psychic man.  I was a
nervous, sensitive boy, a dreamer, a somnambulist, full of impressions
and intuitions.  My black hair, my dark eyes, my thin, olive face, my
tapering fingers, are all characteristic of my real temperament, and
cause experts like Wilson to claim me as their own.  But my brain is
soaked with exact knowledge.  I have trained myself to deal only with
fact and with proof.  Surmise and fancy have no place in my scheme of
thought.  Show me what I can see with my microscope, cut with my
scalpel, weigh in my balance, and I will devote a lifetime to its
investigation.  But when you ask me to study feelings, impressions,
suggestions, you ask me to do what is distasteful and even
demoralizing.  A departure from pure reason affects me like an evil
smell or a musical discord.
