shoulders, that you may have at least one dry garment.” “And now away back to the abbey!” said several. “One moment, sirs,” cried Alleyne, who was leaning on Ford's shoulder,
with the broken sword, which he had picked up, still clutched in his
right hand. “My ears may be somewhat dulled by the water, and perchance
what has been said has escaped me, but I have not yet heard this
gentleman crave pardon for the insults which he put upon me in the
hall.”
