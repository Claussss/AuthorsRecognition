      “She was very straight about it, was Elsie. I can’t say that she
      did not give me every chance of getting out of it if I wished to
      do so. ‘I have had some very disagreeable associations in my
      life,’ said she, ‘I wish to forget all about them. I would rather
      never allude to the past, for it is very painful to me. If you
      take me, Hilton, you will take a woman who has nothing that she
      need be personally ashamed of, but you will have to be content
      with my word for it, and to allow me to be silent as to all that
      passed up to the time when I became yours. If these conditions
      are too hard, then go back to Norfolk, and leave me to the lonely
      life in which you found me.’ It was only the day before our
      wedding that she said those very words to me. I told her that I
      was content to take her on her own terms, and I have been as good
      as my word.
