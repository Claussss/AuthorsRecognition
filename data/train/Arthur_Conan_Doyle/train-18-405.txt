I shut my eyes once or twice and tried to persuade myself that the whole
thing was a delusion, but every time that I opened them there was the
man still regarding me with the same stony, menacing stare. The silence became unendurable. I felt that I must overcome my languor
so far as to address him. I am not a nervous man, and I never knew
before what Virgil meant when he wrote “adhoesit faucibus ora.” At last
I managed to stammer out a few words, asking the intruder who he was and
what he wanted.
