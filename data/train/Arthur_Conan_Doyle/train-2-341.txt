For two days the Hon. Philip Green (he was, I may mention, the son of
the famous admiral of that name who commanded the Sea of Azof fleet in
the Crimean War) brought us no news. On the evening of the third he

powerful frame quivering with excitement. “We have him! We have him!” he cried. He was incoherent in his agitation. Holmes soothed him with a few words
and thrust him into an armchair.
