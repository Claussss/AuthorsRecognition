“How have I been?” the corporal answered gruffly. “Why, I have been
drunk for the most part. When I draw my money I lay it out in liquor,
and as long as that lasts I get some peace in life. When I'm cleaned out
I go upon tramp, partly in the hope of picking up the price of a dram,
and partly in order to look for you.” “You'll excuse us talking about these private matters, West,” the
general said, looking round at me, for I was beginning to move away.
“Don't leave us. You know something of this matter already, and may find
yourself entirely in the swim with us some of these days.”
