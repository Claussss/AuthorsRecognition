“Even now.” “Heh, Jenkin, fetch out the cob!” cried the worthy Wat. “May my right
hand lose its cunning if I do not send you into battle in your father's
suit! To-morrow I must be back in my booth, but to-day I give to you
without fee and for the sake of the good-will which I bear to your
house. I will ride with you to Tilford, and before night you shall see
what Wat can do.” So it came about that there was a busy evening at the old Tilford
Manor-house, where the Lady Ermyntrude planned and cut and hung the
curtains for the hall, and stocked her cupboards with the good things
which Nigel had brought from Guildford.
