I had to knock twice before a servant-maid opened the door and showed me
through a dingy hall into a small room, where sat an elderly, careworn
lady, who introduced herself as Mrs. Heatherstone. With her pale face,
her grey hair, her sad, colourless eyes, and her faded silk dress, she
was in perfect keeping with her melancholy surroundings. “You find us in much trouble, doctor,” she said, in a quiet, refined
voice. “My poor husband has had a great deal to worry him, and his
nervous system for a long time has been in a very weak state. We came to
this part of the country in the hope that the bracing air and the quiet
would have a good effect upon him. Instead of improving, however, he
has seemed to grow weaker, and this morning he is in a high fever and a
little inclined to be delirious. The children and I were so frightened
that we sent for you at once. If you will follow me I will take you to
the general's bedroom.”
