      The face of our unpleasant little visitor turned as white as his
      neckcloth.       “Heavens, sir, what an idea! I never thought of such villainy!
      What inhuman rogues there are in the world! But Godfrey is a fine
      lad—a staunch lad. Nothing would induce him to give his old uncle
      away. I’ll have the plate moved over to the bank this evening. In
      the meantime spare no pains, Mr. Detective! I beg you to leave no
      stone unturned to bring him safely back. As to money, well, so
      far as a fiver or even a tenner goes you can always look to me.”
