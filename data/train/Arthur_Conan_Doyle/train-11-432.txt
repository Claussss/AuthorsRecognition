“Sire!” I cried, “the Prussians!” They all started and stared. It was the Emperor who broke the silence. “Who says they are Prussians?” “I do, Sire--I, Etienne Gerard!” Unpleasant news always made the Emperor furious against the man who
broke it. He railed at me now in the rasping, croaking, Corsican voice
which only made itself heard when he had lost his self-control. “You were always a buffoon,” he cried. “What do you mean, you numskull,
by saying that they are Prussians? How could Prussians be coming from
the direction of France? You have lost any wits that you ever
possessed.”
