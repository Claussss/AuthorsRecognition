‘Enough said!’ I answered sternly. ‘It will not bear discussion. Get ye
to your couch, lest I summon our host and tell him what manner of man he
hath entertained.’ With many grumbles Saxon consented at last to curl his long limbs up
upon a mat, whilst I lay by his side and remained awake until the mellow
light of morning streamed through the chinks between the ill-covered
rafters. Truth to tell, I feared to sleep, lest the freebooting habits
of the soldier of fortune should be too strong for him, and he should
disgrace us in the eyes of our kindly and generous entertainer. At last,
however, his long-drawn breathing assured me that he was asleep, and I
was able to settle down to a few hours of welcome rest.
