April 29.  Our sleepy little town has had a small sensation.  The only
knowledge of crime which we ever have is when a rowdy undergraduate
breaks a few lamps or comes to blows with a policeman.  Last night,
however, there was an attempt made to break-into the branch of the Bank
of England, and we are all in a flutter in consequence. Parkenson, the manager, is an intimate friend of mine, and I found him
very much excited when I walked round there after breakfast.  Had the
thieves broken into the counting-house, they would still have had the
safes to reckon with, so that the defence was considerably stronger
than the attack.  Indeed, the latter does not appear to have ever been
very formidable.  Two of the lower windows have marks as if a chisel or
some such instrument had been pushed under them to force them open.
The police should have a good clue, for the wood-work had been done
with green paint only the day before, and from the smears it is evident
that some of it has found its way on to the criminal's hands or clothes.
