      Briarbrae, Woking.
          My dear Watson,—I have no doubt that you can remember
          “Tadpole” Phelps, who was in the fifth form when you were in
          the third. It is possible even that you may have heard that
          through my uncle’s influence I obtained a good appointment at
          the Foreign Office, and that I was in a situation of trust
          and honour until a horrible misfortune came suddenly to blast
          my career.
          There is no use writing of the details of that dreadful
          event. In the event of your acceding to my request it is
          probable that I shall have to narrate them to you. I have
          only just recovered from nine weeks of brain-fever, and am
          still exceedingly weak. Do you think that you could bring
          your friend Mr. Holmes down to see me? I should like to have
          his opinion of the case, though the authorities assure me
          that nothing more can be done. Do try to bring him down, and
          as soon as possible. Every minute seems an hour while I live
          in this state of horrible suspense. Assure him that if I have
          not asked his advice sooner it was not because I did not
          appreciate his talents, but because I have been off my head
          ever since the blow fell. Now I am clear again, though I dare
          not think of it too much for fear of a relapse. I am still so
          weak that I have to write, as you see, by dictating. Do try
          to bring him.
