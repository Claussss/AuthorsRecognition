“I pray that it will rest easy in Paradise,” said Nigel; “for at the
hour that I hear that I am dishonored and my prisoner slain I tear this
bandage from my head and so end all things. I will not live when once my
word is broken.” “Nay, fair son, you take this thing too heavily,” said Chandos, with a
grave face. “When a man has done all he may there remains no dishonor;
but the King hath a kind heart for all his hot head, and it may be that
if I see him I will prevail upon him. Bethink you how he swore to hang
the six burghers of this very town, and yet he pardoned them. So keep a
high heart, fair son, and I will come with good news ere evening.”
