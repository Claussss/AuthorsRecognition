      “The injury from which the unfortunate veteran was suffering was
      found to be a jagged cut some two inches long at the back part of
      his head, which had evidently been caused by a violent blow from
      a blunt weapon. Nor was it difficult to guess what that weapon
      may have been. Upon the floor, close to the body, was lying a
      singular club of hard carved wood with a bone handle. The Colonel
      possessed a varied collection of weapons brought from the
      different countries in which he had fought, and it is conjectured
      by the police that his club was among his trophies. The servants
      deny having seen it before, but among the numerous curiosities in
      the house it is possible that it may have been overlooked.
      Nothing else of importance was discovered in the room by the
      police, save the inexplicable fact that neither upon Mrs.
      Barclay’s person nor upon that of the victim nor in any part of
      the room was the missing key to be found. The door had eventually
      to be opened by a locksmith from Aldershot.
