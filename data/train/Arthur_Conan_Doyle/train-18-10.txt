CHAPTER II. OF THE STRANGE MANNER IN WHICH A TENANT CAME TO CLOOMBER Branksome might have appeared a poor dwelling-place when compared with
the house of an English squire, but to us, after our long residence in
stuffy apartments, it was of regal magnificence. The building was broad-spread and low, with red-tiled roof,
diamond-paned windows, and a profusion of dwelling rooms with
smoke-blackened ceilings and oaken wainscots. In front was a small lawn,
girt round with a thin fringe of haggard and ill grown beeches, all
gnarled and withered from the effects of the sea-spray. Behind lay the
scattered hamlet of Branksome-Bere--a dozen cottages at most--inhabited
by rude fisher-folk who looked upon the laird as their natural
protector.
