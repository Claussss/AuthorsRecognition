      “Because we bring him news of his lost son.”       The landlord gave a very visible start.       “What, you’re on his track?”       “He has been heard of in Liverpool. They expect to get him every
      hour.”       Again a swift change passed over the heavy, unshaven face. His
      manner was suddenly genial.       “I’ve less reason to wish the Dook well than most men,” said he,
      “for I was head coachman once, and cruel bad he treated me. It
      was him that sacked me without a character on the word of a lying
      corn-chandler. But I’m glad to hear that the young lord was heard
      of in Liverpool, and I’ll help you to take the news to the Hall.”
