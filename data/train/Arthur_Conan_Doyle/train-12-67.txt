a piano-board projecting from the wall. “I can recommend the Tokay. I
have it from the man who supplies the Emperor of Austria, though I think
I may say that I get the cream of it.” He struck twice upon one of the piano-notes, and sat expectant. With a
sharp click at the end of ten seconds a sliding shutter flew open, and
a small tray protruded bearing two long tapering Venetian glasses filled
with wine.
