The friendly negro who had talked of himself as Tippy Tilly had managed
to slip a piece of cloth soaked in water into the hand of Mr. Stephens,
and Miss Adams had moistened her lips with it. Even the few drops had
given her renewed strength, and, now that the first crushing shock was
over, her wiry, elastic, Yankee nature began to reassert itself. “These people don't look as if they would harm us, Mr. Stephens,” said
she. “I guess they have a working religion of their own, such as it is,
and that what's wrong to us is wrong to them.”
