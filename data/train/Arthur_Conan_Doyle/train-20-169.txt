      “Has he been moved?” asked Holmes.       “We have moved nothing except the lady. We could not leave her
      lying wounded upon the floor.”       “How long have you been here, Doctor?”       “Since four o’clock.”       “Anyone else?”       “Yes, the constable here.”       “And you have touched nothing?”       “Nothing.”       “You have acted with great discretion. Who sent for you?”       “The housemaid, Saunders.”
