The King sat upon a keg in the fore part of his ship, with little John
of Richmond, who was no more than a schoolboy, perched upon his knee.
Edward was clad in the black velvet jacket which was his favorite garb,
and wore a small brown-beaver hat with a white plume at the side. A rich
cloak of fur turned up with miniver drooped from his shoulders. Behind
him were a score of his knights, brilliant in silks and sarcenets,
some seated on an upturned boat and some swinging their legs from the
bulwark.
