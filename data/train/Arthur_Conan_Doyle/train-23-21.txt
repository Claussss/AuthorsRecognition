Apart from Home, another episode which marks a stage in the advance of
this movement was the investigation and report by the Dialectical
Society in the year 1869.  This body was composed of men of various
learned professions who gathered together to investigate the alleged
facts, and ended by reporting that they really WERE facts.  They were
unbiased, and their conclusions were founded upon results which were
very soberly set forth in their report, a most convincing document
which, even now in 1919, after the lapse of fifty years, is far more
intelligent than the greater part of current opinion upon this subject.
None the less, it was greeted by a chorus of ridicule by the ignorant
Press of that day, who, if the same men had come to the opposite
conclusion in spite of the evidence, would have been ready to hail
their verdict as the undoubted end of a pernicious movement.
