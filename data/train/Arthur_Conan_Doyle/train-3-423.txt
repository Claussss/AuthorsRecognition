       *       *       *       *       * _The Third Volume of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's
History of the War_ =THE BRITISH CAMPAIGN in FRANCE
and FLANDERS      1916= =With Maps, Plans and Diagrams= "We gave praise, and it was high, to the first and second volumes of
'The British Campaign in France and Flanders.' We can give the same to
the third, and more, too. For the whole of this volume is devoted to the
preliminaries and the full grapple of the Battle of the Somme--a theme
far surpassing everything that went before in magnitude and
dreadfulness, but also in inspiration for our own race and in profound
human import of every kind."--_Observer_
