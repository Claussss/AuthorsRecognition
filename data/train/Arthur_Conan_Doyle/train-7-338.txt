“It was all your doing.” “Yes, my friend, and I have been quarrelling with you,--ungrateful
wretch that I am!” “But how did I save you?” “It was you who arranged with this excellent Tippy Tilly and the others
that they should have so much if they brought us alive into Egypt again.
They slipped away in the darkness and hid themselves in the grove. Then,
when we were left, they crept up with their rifles and shot the men who
were about to murder us. That cursed Moolah, I am sorry they shot him,
for I believe that I could have persuaded him to be a Christian. And
now, with your permission, I will hurry on and embrace Miss Adams, for
Belmont has his wife, and Stephens has Miss Sadie, so I think it is very
evident that the sympathy of Miss Adams is reserved for me.”
