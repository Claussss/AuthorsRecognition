      “No, sir, I don’t know that.”       “What then?”       “I know why he was at the gate at that hour. It was to meet a
      woman.”       “To meet a woman! He?”       “Yes, sir.”       “And the woman’s name?”       “I can’t give you the name, sir, but I can give you the initials.
      Her initials were L. L.”       “How do you know this, Barrymore?”       “Well, Sir Henry, your uncle had a letter that morning. He had
      usually a great many letters, for he was a public man and well
      known for his kind heart, so that everyone who was in trouble was
      glad to turn to him. But that morning, as it chanced, there was
      only this one letter, so I took the more notice of it. It was
      from Coombe Tracey, and it was addressed in a woman’s hand.”
