      “And the criminal?”       Holmes scribbled a few words upon the back of one of his visiting
      cards and threw it over to Lestrade.       “That is the name,” he said. “You cannot effect an arrest until
      to-morrow night at the earliest. I should prefer that you do not
      mention my name at all in connection with the case, as I choose
      to be only associated with those crimes which present some
      difficulty in their solution. Come on, Watson.” We strode off
      together to the station, leaving Lestrade still staring with a
      delighted face at the card which Holmes had thrown him.
