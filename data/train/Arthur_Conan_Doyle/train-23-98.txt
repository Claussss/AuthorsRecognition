It is not possible to define exactly what occurs in the case of the
ectoplasm, nor, on account of its vital connection with the medium and
its evanescent nature, has it been separated and subjected to even the
roughest chemical analysis which might show whether it is composed of
those earthly elements with which we are familiar.  Is it rather some
coagulation of ether which introduces an absolutely new substance into
our world?  Such a supposition seems most probable, for a comparison
with the analogous substance examined at Dr. Crawford's seances at
Belfast, which is at the same time hardly visible to the eye and yet
capable of handling a weight of 150 pounds, suggests something entirely
new in the way of matter.
