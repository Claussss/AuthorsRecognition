Here is a pen-portrait of him by one who knew him well--   "I can see him now as I saw him in '84 walking down Holborn
  Hill, towards Smithfield. He had on a scarlet coat worked
  in gold at the buttonholes, ruffles and frill of fine lace,
  a small white stock, no collar (they were not then invented),
  a looped hat with a broad black band, buff knee-breeches
  and long silk strings, striped white silk stockings, pumps
  and paste buckles; his waistcoat was pale blue satin,
  sprigged with white. It was impossible to look on his fine
  ample chest, his noble shoulders, his waist (if anything
  too small), his large but not too large hips, his balustrade
  calf and beautifully turned but not over delicate ankle,
  his firm foot and peculiarly small hand, without thinking
  that nature had sent him on earth as a model. On he went
  at a good five miles and a half an hour, the envy of all
  men and the admiration of all women."
