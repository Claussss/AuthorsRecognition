It was, then, with considerable surprise that I received a telegram
from Holmes last Tuesday—he has never been known to write where a
telegram would serve—in the following terms: “Why not tell them of the
Cornish horror—strangest case I have handled.” I have no idea what
backward sweep of memory had brought the matter fresh to his mind, or
what freak had caused him to desire that I should recount it; but I
hasten, before another cancelling telegram may arrive, to hunt out the
notes which give me the exact details of the case and to lay the
narrative before my readers.
