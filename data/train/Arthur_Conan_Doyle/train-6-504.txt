Aylward sat on the upturned keel of a skiff which lay upon the deck. He
groaned sadly and held his green face between his two hands. “I would
gladly sling you into the sea once more, master-shipman,” said he, “if
by so doing I could get off this most accursed vessel of thine. Or if
you would wish to have your turn, then I would thank you if you would
lend me a hand over the side, for indeed I am but a useless weight upon
your deck. Little did I think that Samkin Aylward could be turned into
a weakling by an hour of salt water. Alas the day that ever my foot
wandered from the good red heather of Crooksbury!”
