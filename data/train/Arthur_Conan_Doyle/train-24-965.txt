“Well shot, old lad! It is indeed over his head,” cried the bowmen. “Mon Dieu!” exclaimed the Brabanter, “who ever saw such a shoot?” “It is but a trick,” quoth John. “Many a time have I won a gallon of ale
by covering a mile in three flights down Wilverley Chase.” “It fell a hundred and thirty paces beyond the fifth mark,” shouted an
archer in the distance. “Six hundred and thirty paces! Mon Dieu! but that is a shoot! And yet it
says nothing for your weapon, mon gros camarade, for it was by turning
yourself into a crossbow that you did it.”
