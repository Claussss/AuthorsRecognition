‘“Farewell, mate! In action, take an old sailor’s advice. Keep the
weather-gauge and board! Tell that to your admiral on the day of battle.
Whisper it in his ear. Say to him, ‘Keep the weather-gauge and board!’
Tell him also to strike quick, strike hard, and keep on striking. That’s
the word of Christopher Mings, and a better man has not been launched,
though he did climb in through the hawse-pipe.--Yours to command,
SOLOMON SPRENT.”’
