“Abousir is on this side, is it not?” “Yes. That is why the excursion to the Abousir Rock has been forbidden
for the last year. But things are quieter now.” “What is to prevent them from coming down on that side?” “Absolutely nothing,” said Cecil Brown, in his listless voice. “Nothing, except their fears. The coming, of course, would be absolutely
simple. The difficulty would lie in the return. They might find it hard
to get back if their camels were spent and the Haifa garrison with their
beasts fresh got on their track. They know it as well as we do, and it
has kept them from trying.”
