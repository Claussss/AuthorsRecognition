Then at last after passing Lusignan they began to come in touch with
English foragers, mounted bowmen for the most part, who were endeavoring
to collect supplies either for the army or for themselves. From them
Nigel learned that the Prince, with Chandos ever at his side, was
hastening south and might be met within a short day's march. As he still
advanced these English stragglers became more and more numerous, until
at last he overtook a considerable column of archers moving in the same
direction as his own party. These were men whose horses had failed them
and who had therefore been left behind on the advance, but were now
hastening to be in time for the impending battle. A crowd of peasant
girls accompanied them upon their march, and a whole train of laden
mules were led beside them.
