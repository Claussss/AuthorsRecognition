Having indicated the course of events in the Eastern Transvaal, north
and south of the railway line, I will now treat one or two incidents
which occurred in the more central and northern portions of the country.
I will then give some account of De Wet's doings in the Orange River
Colony, and finally describe that brilliant effort of De la Rey's in the
west which shed a last glory upon the Boer arms.
