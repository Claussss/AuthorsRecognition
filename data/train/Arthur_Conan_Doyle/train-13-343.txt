      Our chambers were always full of chemicals and of criminal relics
      which had a way of wandering into unlikely positions, and of
      turning up in the butter-dish or in even less desirable places.
      But his papers were my great crux. He had a horror of destroying
      documents, especially those which were connected with his past
      cases, and yet it was only once in every year or two that he
      would muster energy to docket and arrange them; for, as I have
      mentioned somewhere in these incoherent memoirs, the outbursts of
      passionate energy when he performed the remarkable feats with
      which his name is associated were followed by reactions of
      lethargy during which he would lie about with his violin and his
      books, hardly moving save from the sofa to the table. Thus month
      after month his papers accumulated, until every corner of the
      room was stacked with bundles of manuscript which were on no
      account to be burned, and which could not be put away save by
      their owner. One winterâ€™s night, as we sat together by the fire,
      I ventured to suggest to him that, as he had finished pasting
      extracts into his common-place book, he might employ the next two
      hours in making our room a little more habitable. He could not
      deny the justice of my request, so with a rather rueful face he
      went off to his bedroom, from which he returned presently pulling
      a large tin box behind him. This he placed in the middle of the
      floor and, squatting down upon a stool in front of it, he threw
      back the lid. I could see that it was already a third full of
      bundles of paper tied up with red tape into separate packages.
