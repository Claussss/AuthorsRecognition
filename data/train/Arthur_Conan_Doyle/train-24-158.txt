“Afeard, thou lurden!” growled big John. “I never saw the face yet of
the man that I was afeard of. Come out, and we shall see who is the
better man.” “But the wager?” “I have nought to wager. Come out for the love and the lust of the
thing.” “Nought to wager!” cried the soldier. “Why, you have that which I covet
above all things. It is that big body of thine that I am after. See,
now, mon garcon. I have a French feather-bed there, which I have been at
pains to keep these years back. I had it at the sacking of Issodun, and
the King himself hath not such a bed. If you throw me, it is thine; but,
if I throw you, then you are under a vow to take bow and bill and hie
with me to France, there to serve in the White Company as long as we be
enrolled.”
