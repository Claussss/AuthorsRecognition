‘The broth is fairly on the fire, then,’ quoth Decimus Saxon, as we rode
onwards. ‘Now that skins have been slit the rebels may draw their swords
and fling away their scabbards, for it’s either victory for them or
their quarters will be dangling in every market town of the county. Heh,
lad? we throw a main for a brave stake.’ ‘Marked ye that Lord Grey had met with a check,’ said I. ‘Pshaw! it is of no import. A cavalry skirmish at the most, for it is
impossible that Monmouth could have brought his main forces to Bridport;
nor would he if he could, for it is out of his track. It was one of
those three-shots-and-a-gallop affrays, where each side runs away and
each claims the victory. But here we are in the streets of Salisbury.
Now leave the talking to me, or your wrong-headed truthfulness may lay
us by the heels before our time.’
