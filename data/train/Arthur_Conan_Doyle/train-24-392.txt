“My sweet bird,” said Sir Nigel, “I am right loth to part from you,
but we are now at the fringe of the forest, and it is not right that I
should take the chatelaine too far from her trust.” “But oh, my dear lord,” she cried with a trembling lip, “let me bide
with you for one furlong further--or one and a half perhaps. You may
spare me this out of the weary miles that you will journey along.” “Come, then, my heart's comfort,” he answered. “But I must crave a gage
from thee. It is my custom, dearling, and hath been since I have
first known thee, to proclaim by herald in such camps, townships, or
fortalices as I may chance to visit, that my lady-love, being beyond
compare the fairest and sweetest in Christendom, I should deem it great
honor and kindly condescension if any cavalier would run three courses
against me with sharpened lances, should he chance to have a lady whose
claim he was willing to advance. I pray you then my fair dove, that you
will vouchsafe to me one of those doeskin gloves, that I may wear it as
the badge of her whose servant I shall ever be.”
