Zeerust and Lichtenburg had each been garrisoned and provisioned by Lord
Methuen before he carried his column away to the south-west, where much
rough and useful work awaited him. The two towns were at once invested
by the enemy, who made an attack upon each of them. That upon Zeerust,
on January 7th, was a small matter and easily repulsed. A more
formidable one was made on Lichtenburg, on March 3rd. The attack was
delivered by De la Rey, Smuts, and Celliers, with 1500 men, who galloped
up to the pickets in the early morning. The defenders were 600 in
number, consisting of Paget's Horse and three companies of the 1st
battalion of the Northumberland Fusiliers, a veteran regiment with
a long record of foreign service, not to be confused with that 2nd
battalion which was so severely handled upon several occasions. It was
well that it was so, for less sturdy material might have been overborne
by the vigour of the attack. As it was, the garrison were driven to
their last trench, but held out under a very heavy fire all day, and
next morning the Boers abandoned the attack. Their losses appear to have
been over fifty in number, and included Commandant Celliers, who was
badly wounded and afterwards taken prisoner at Warm Baths. The
brave garrison lost fourteen killed, including two officers of the
Northumberlands, and twenty wounded.
