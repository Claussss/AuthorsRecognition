But the wild horse only swelled into a greater fury. In the sullen gloom
of its untamed heart there rose the furious resolve to dash the life
from this clinging rider, even if it meant destruction to beast and man.
With red, blazing eyes it looked round for death. On three sides the
five-virgate field was bounded by a high wall, broken only at one spot
by a heavy four-foot wooden gate. But on the fourth side was a low
gray building, one of the granges of the Abbey, presenting a long flank
unbroken by door or window. The horse stretched itself into a gallop,
and headed straight for that craggy thirty-foot wall. He would break in
red ruin at the base of it if he could but dash forever the life of this
man, who claimed mastery over that which had never found its master yet.
