      “What an eye you have!” he cried, with a sigh of relief. ‘It is
      just as you say. But we won’t talk of it. Of all ghosts the
      ghosts of our old lovers are the worst. Come into the
      billiard-room and have a quiet cigar.’       “From that day, amid all his cordiality, there was always a touch
      of suspicion in Mr. Trevor’s manner towards me. Even his son
      remarked it. ‘You’ve given the governor such a turn,’ said he,
      ‘that he’ll never be sure again of what you know and what you
      don’t know.’ He did not mean to show it, I am sure, but it was so
      strongly in his mind that it peeped out at every action. At last
      I became so convinced that I was causing him uneasiness that I
      drew my visit to a close. On the very day, however, before I
      left, an incident occurred which proved in the sequel to be of
      importance.
