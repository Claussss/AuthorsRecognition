April 13.  My nerves have quite recovered their tone.  I really believe
that I have conquered the creature.  But I must confess to living in
some suspense.  She is well again, for I hear that she was driving with
Mrs. Wilson in the High Street in the afternoon. April 14.  I do wish I could get away from the place altogether.  I
shall fly to Agatha's side the very day that the term closes.  I
suppose it is pitiably weak of me, but this woman gets upon my nerves
most terribly.  I have seen her again, and I have spoken with her.
