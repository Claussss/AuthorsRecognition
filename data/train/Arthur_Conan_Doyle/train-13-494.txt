      “From the police I learned that Miss Morrison, who you remember
      went out that evening with Mrs. Barclay, denied having any
      knowledge of what it was which had caused the ill-humour in which
      her companion had returned.       “Having gathered these facts, Watson, I smoked several pipes over
      them, trying to separate those which were crucial from others
      which were merely incidental. There could be no question that the
      most distinctive and suggestive point in the case was the
      singular disappearance of the door-key. A most careful search had
      failed to discover it in the room. Therefore it must have been
      taken from it. But neither the Colonel nor the Colonel’s wife
      could have taken it. That was perfectly clear. Therefore a third
      person must have entered the room. And that third person could
      only have come in through the window. It seemed to me that a
      careful examination of the room and the lawn might possibly
      reveal some traces of this mysterious individual. You know my
      methods, Watson. There was not one of them which I did not apply
      to the inquiry. And it ended by my discovering traces, but very
      different ones from those which I had expected. There had been a
      man in the room, and he had crossed the lawn coming from the
      road. I was able to obtain five very clear impressions of his
      footmarks: one in the roadway itself, at the point where he had
      climbed the low wall, two on the lawn, and two very faint ones
      upon the stained boards near the window where he had entered. He
      had apparently rushed across the lawn, for his toe-marks were
      much deeper than his heels. But it was not the man who surprised
      me. It was his companion.”
