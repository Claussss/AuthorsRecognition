"I have hardly glanced at his writings," said he.  "By-the-way, I
suppose that there was no special departmental news?" "Ah!  I had almost forgotten.  Yes, it was one of the things which I

There is a vacancy there." "It had better be filled at once.  The longer delay the more
applicants." "Ah, patronage, patronage!" sighed the Prime Minister.  "Every vacancy
makes one doubtful friend and a dozen very positive enemies.  Who so
bitter as the disappointed place-seeker?  But you are right, Charles.
Better fill it at once, especially as there is some little trouble in
Morocco.  I understand that the Duke of Tavistock would like the place
for his fourth son, Lord Arthur Sibthorpe.  We are under some
obligation to the Duke."
