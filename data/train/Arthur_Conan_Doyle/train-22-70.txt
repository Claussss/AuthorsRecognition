sense was still pondering the open window. “It's all very well your
saying that a man escaped by wading this moat, but what I ask you is,
how did he ever get into the house at all if the bridge was up?” “Ah, that's the question,” said Barker. “At what o'clock was it raised?” “It was nearly six o'clock,” said Ames, the butler. “I've heard,” said the sergeant, “that it was usually raised at sunset.
That would be nearer half-past four than six at this time of year.”
