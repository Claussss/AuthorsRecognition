But there are never effects without causes, however inadequate
the cause may be. What was it that stood in the way of the book's
success? Undoubtedly it was the style. And yet it is subdued and
tempered here with little of the luxuriance and exuberance which
it attained in the later works. But it was an innovation, and it
stalled off both the public and the critics. They regarded it, no
doubt, as an affectation, as Carlyle's had been considered twenty
years before, forgetting that in the case of an original genius
style is an organic thing, part of the man as much as the colour of
his eyes. It is not, to quote Carlyle, a shirt to be taken on and
off at pleasure, but a skin, eternally fixed. And this strange,
powerful style, how is it to be described? Best, perhaps, in his
own strong words, when he spoke of Carlyle with perhaps the arriere
pensee that the words would apply as strongly to himself.
