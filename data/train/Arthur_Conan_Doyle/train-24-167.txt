morning?” “To Minstead,” quoth he. “My brother Simon Edricson is socman there, and
I go to bide with him for a while. I prythee, let me have my score, good
dame.” “Score, indeed!” cried she, standing with upraised hands in front of the
panel on which Alleyne had worked the night before. “Say, rather what
it is that I owe to thee, good youth. Aye, this is indeed a pied merlin,
and with a leveret under its claws, as I am a living woman. By the rood
of Waltham! but thy touch is deft and dainty.”
