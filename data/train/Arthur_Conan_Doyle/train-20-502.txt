      Holmes rubbed his hands.       “This is certainly very novel,” said he.       “I thought it would please you. But I have not got to the end

      that the window had been opened in the night and that the broken
      pieces of his second bust were strewn all over the room. It had
      been smashed to atoms where it stood. In neither case were there
      any signs which could give us a clue as to the criminal or
      lunatic who had done the mischief. Now, Mr. Holmes, you have got
      the facts.”
