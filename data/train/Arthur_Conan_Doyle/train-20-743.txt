      I was horrified by my first glimpse of Holmes next morning, for
      he sat by the fire holding his tiny hypodermic syringe. I
      associated that instrument with the single weakness of his
      nature, and I feared the worst when I saw it glittering in his
      hand. He laughed at my expression of dismay and laid it upon the
      table.       “No, no, my dear fellow, there is no cause for alarm. It is not
      upon this occasion the instrument of evil, but it will rather
      prove to be the key which will unlock our mystery. On this
      syringe I base all my hopes. I have just returned from a small
      scouting expedition, and everything is favourable. Eat a good
      breakfast, Watson, for I propose to get upon Dr. Armstrong’s
      trail to-day, and once on it I will not stop for rest or food
      until I run him to his burrow.”
