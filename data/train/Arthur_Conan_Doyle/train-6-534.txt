A sudden wave of terror passed over the English seamen. One of them
tried to pass and get behind the brazen man, but he was pinned against
the side by a quick movement and his brains dashed out by a smashing
blow from the heavy mace. Wild panic seized the others, and they rushed
back to the boat. Aylward strung an arrow, but his bowstring was damp
and the shaft rang loudly upon the shining breast-plate and glanced off
into the sea. Masters struck the brazen head with a sword, but the blade
snapped without injuring the helmet, and an instant later the bowman was
stretched senseless on the deck. The seamen shrank from this terrible
silent creature and huddled in the stern, all the fight gone out of
them.
