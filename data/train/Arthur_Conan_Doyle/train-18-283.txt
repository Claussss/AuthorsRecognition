“Don't you think,” said Esther, in an awe-struck whisper, “that it is
very strange that these priests should arrive here all the way from
India just at the present moment? Have you not gathered from all you
have heard that the general's fears are in some way connected with India
and the Indians?” The remark made me thoughtful. “Why, now that you mention it,” I answered, “I have some vague
impression that the mystery is connected with some incident which
occurred in that country. I am sure, however, that your fears would
vanish if you saw Ram Singh. He is the very personification of wisdom
and benevolence. He was shocked at the idea of our killing a sheep, or
even a fish for his benefit--said he would rather die than have a hand
in taking the life of an animal.”
