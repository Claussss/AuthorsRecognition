“Indeed, Robert,” said Percy, “it is in my mind that this Frenchman
speaks very wisely and well.” “And when we have taken the castle--what then?” asked Knolles. “Then you could go upon your way, fair sir, and we upon ours. Or if it
please you better you could draw together on yonder hill and we on this
one, so that the valley lies between us. Then if any cavalier wished to
advance himself or to shed a vow and exalt his lady, an opening might
be found for him. Surely it would be shame if so many brave men drew
together and no small deed were to come of it.”
