“Then good-bye to the ancient and powerful town of Lepe,” quoth Ford,
whose lightness of tongue could at times rise above his awe of Sir
Nigel. The knight, however, was too much intent upon the matter in hand to give
heed to the flippancy of his squire. “Have you then cause,” he asked,
“to think that these men are about to venture an attempt upon you?” “They have come in two great galleys,” answered the mayor, “with two
bank of oars on either side, and great store of engines of war and
of men-at-arms. At Weymouth and at Portland they have murdered and
ravished. Yesterday morning they were at Cowes, and we saw the smoke
from the burning crofts. To-day they lie at their ease near Freshwater,
and we fear much lest they come upon us and do us a mischief.”
