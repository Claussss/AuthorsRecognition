There is a big two-volumed book at the end of my science shelf which
would, even now, have its right to be called scientific disputed
by some of the pedants. It is Myers' "Human Personality." My own
opinion, for what it is worth, is that it will be recognized a
century hence as a great root book, one from which a whole new
branch of science will have sprung. Where between four covers will
you find greater evidence of patience, of industry, of thought,
of discrimination, of that sweep of mind which can gather up a
thousand separate facts and bind them all in the meshes of a single
consistent system? Darwin has not been a more ardent collector in
zoology than Myers in the dim regions of psychic research, and his
whole hypothesis, so new that a new nomenclature and terminology
had to be invented to express it, telepathy, the subliminal, and
the rest of it, will always be a monument of acute reasoning,
expressed in fine prose and founded upon ascertained fact.
