The Abbey court sat in the chapter-house at the canonical hour of
tierce, which was nine in the forenoon. At all times the function was
a solemn one, even when the culprit might be a villain who was taken
poaching on the Abbey estate, or a chapman who had given false measure
from his biased scales. But now, when a man of noble birth was to be
tried, the whole legal and ecclesiastical ceremony was carried out with
every detail, grotesque or impressive, which the full ritual prescribed.
The distant roll of church music and the slow tolling of the Abbey bell;
the white-robed brethren, two and two, walked thrice round the hall
singing the “Benedicite” and the “Veni, Creator” before they settled in
their places at the desks on either side. Then in turn each high officer
of the Abbey from below upward, the almoner, the lector, the chaplain,
the subprior and the prior, swept to their wonted places.
