‘This is a civil war within a civil war,’ said Lord Grey, with a quiet
smile. ‘We had best draw, gentlemen, and defend the gap in the rails, if
we may hold it good until help arrives.’ He flashed out his rapier as
he spoke, and took his stand on the top of the steps, with Saxon and Sir
Gervas upon one side of him, Buyse, Reuben, and myself upon the other.
There was only room for six to wield their weapons with effect, so our
scanty band of followers scattered themselves along the line of the
rails, which were luckily so high and strong as to make an escalado
difficult in the face of any opposition.
