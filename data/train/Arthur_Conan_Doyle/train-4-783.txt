The Duke was once again conversing with himself rather than with me, so
that I made no remark, save to observe that Monmouth had won the hearts
of the lower people. ‘There lies his strength,’ said Beaufort. ‘The blood of his mother runs
in his veins. He doth not think it beneath him to shake the dirty paw
of Jerry the tinker, or to run a race against a bumpkin on the village
green. Well, events have shown that he hath been right. These same
bumpkins have stood by him when nobler friends have held aloof. I would
I could see into the future. But you have my message, Captain, and
I trust that, if you change it in the delivery, it will be in the
direction of greater warmth and kindliness. It is time now that you
depart, for within three hours the guard is changed, and your escape
will be discovered.’
