There was a time when the Lorings had held the country from the North
Downs to the Lakes of Frensham, and when their grim castle-keep
rising above the green meadows which border the River Wey had been the
strongest fortalice betwixt Guildford Castle in the east and Winchester
in the west. But there came that Barons' War, in which the King used his
Saxon subjects as a whip with which to scourge his Norman barons, and
Castle Loring, like so many other great strongholds, was swept from
the face of the land. From that time the Lorings, with estates sadly
curtailed, lived in what had been the dower-house, with enough for
splendor.
