Nigel told to the old Knight all that had occurred, saying little of his
own success and much of his own failure, yet the eyes of the dark woman
burned the brighter as she sat at her tapestry and listened. Sir John followed the story with a running fire of oaths, prayers,
thumps with his great fist and flourishes of his crutch. “Well, well,
lad, you could scarce expect to hold your saddle against Manny, and you
have carried yourself well. We are proud of you, Nigel, for you are our
own man, reared in the heather country. But indeed I take shame that you
are not more skilled in the mystery of the woods, seeing that I have had
the teaching of you, and that no one in broad England is my master at
the craft. I pray you to fill your cup again whilst I make use of the
little time that is left to us.”
