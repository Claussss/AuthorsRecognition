one who hath much guile as well as valour. A stern, fierce soldier
he was, as I know well, having fought back to back with him for forty

speech he was, and perhaps a trifle inconsiderate of the honour of a
cavalier, but in the field it would have been well for the army had they
had more such commanders.’
