‘Show them down, Jem!’ he kept shouting to the mate. ‘Stow them safe,
Jem! There’s lodgings for a duchess down there, s’help me, there’s
lodgings for a duchess! Pack ‘em away!’ One by one we passed before the delighted captain, and down the steep
ladder which led into the hold. Here we were led along a narrow passage,
on either side of which opened the stalls which were prepared for us. As
each man came opposite to the one set aside for him he was thrown into
it by the brawny mate, and fastened down with anklets of iron by the
seaman armourer in attendance. It was dark before we were all secured,
but the captain came round with a lanthorn to satisfy himself that all
his property was really safe. I could hear the mate and him reckoning
the value of each prisoner, and counting what he would fetch in the
Barbadoes market.
