      “Your visitor seems to have left traces in your bedroom as well
      as in your sitting-room, Mr. Soames.”       “What could he have wanted there?”       “I think it is clear enough. You came back by an unexpected way,
      and so he had no warning until you were at the very door. What
      could he do? He caught up everything which would betray him, and
      he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself.”
