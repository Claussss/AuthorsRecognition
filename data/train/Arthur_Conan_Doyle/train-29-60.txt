I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast
and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the
room. “You have really got it!” he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either
shoulder and looking eagerly into his face. “But you have hopes?” “I have hopes.” “Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone.” “We must have a cab.” “No, my brougham is waiting.” “Then that will simplify matters.” We descended and started off once
more for Briony Lodge.
