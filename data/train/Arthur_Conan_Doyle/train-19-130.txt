It was unbroken, and I picked it up.  Outside was written "Sulphuric
Acid.  Fort."  When I drew the round glass stopper, a thick fume rose
slowly up, and a pungent, choking smell pervaded the room.  I
recognized it as one which I kept for chemical testing in my chambers.
But why had I brought a bottle of vitriol into Agatha's chamber?  Was
it not this thick, reeking liquid with which jealous women had been
known to mar the beauty of their rivals?  My heart stood still as I
held the bottle to the light.  Thank God, it was full!  No mischief had
been done as yet.  But had Agatha come in a minute sooner, was it not
certain that the hellish parasite within me would have dashed the stuff
into her----  Ah, it will not bear to be thought of!  But it must have
been for that.  Why else should I have brought it?  At the thought of
what I might have done my worn nerves broke down, and I sat shivering
and twitching, the pitiable wreck of a man.
