“Make what, Mr. Stephens?” “A memo a memorandum, you know. We put _re_ so-and-so to show what it is
about.” “I suppose it's a good short way,” said Miss Sadie, “but it feels
queer somehow when applied to scenery or to dead Egyptian kings. '_Re_
Cheops,'--doesn't that strike you as funny?” “No, I can't say that it does,” said Stephens. “I wonder if it is true that the English have less humour than the
Americans, or whether it's just another kind of humour,” said the girl.
She had a quiet, abstracted way of talking as if she were thinking
aloud. “I used to imagine they had less, and yet, when you come to
think of it, Dickens and Thackeray and Barrie, and so many other of the
humourists we admire most, are Britishers. Besides, I never in all my

man behind us, and every time he laughed auntie looked round to see if
a door had opened, he made such a draught. But you have some funny
expressions, Mr. Stephens!”
