"You are still my wife, Jinny," said O'Brien; "I forgive you from the
bottom of my heart.  I love you, and I have never ceased to love you,
though you had forgotten me." "No, James, my heart was always in Melbourne.  I have always been
yours.  I thought that it was better for you that I should seem to be
dead." "You must choose between us now, Jinny.  If you determine to remain
here, I shall not open my lips.  There shall be no scandal.  If, on the
other hand, you come with me, it's little I care about the world's
opinion.  Perhaps I am as much to blame as you.  I thought too much of
my work and too little of my wife."
