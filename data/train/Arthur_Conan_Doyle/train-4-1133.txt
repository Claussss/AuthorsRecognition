We were scarce back in the wool-house once more when a file of
guards with a sergeant entered, escorting a long, pale-faced man with
protruding teeth, whose bright blue coat and white silk breeches,
gold-headed sword, and glancing shoe-buckles, proclaimed him to be one
of those London exquisites whom interest or curiosity had brought down
to the scene of the rebellion. He tripped along upon his tiptoes like a
French dancing-master, waving his scented kerchief in front of his
thin high nose, and inhaling aromatic salts from a blue phial which he
carried in his left hand.
