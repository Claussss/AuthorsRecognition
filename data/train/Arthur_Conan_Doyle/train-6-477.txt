For an hour or more Chandos paced upon the ramparts with his young
Squire at his elbow and talked to him of his duties and of the secrets
and craft of warfare, Nigel drinking in and storing in his memory every
word from so revered a teacher. Many a time in after life, in stress and
in danger, he strengthened himself by the memory of that slow walk with
the blue sea on one side and the fair town on the other, when the wise
soldier and noble-hearted knight poured forth his precept and advice as
the master workman to the apprentice.
