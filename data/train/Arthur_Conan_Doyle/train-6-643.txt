It chanced that one fine carack had outstripped its consorts and came
sweeping along, all red and gold, with a fringe of twinkling steel, a
good half-mile before the fleet. Edward looked at her with a kindling
eye, for indeed she was a noble sight with the blue water creaming under
her gilded prow. “This is a most worthy and debonair vessel, Master Bunce,” said he to
the shipman beside him. “I would fain have a tilt with her. I pray you
to hold us straight that we may bear her down.”
