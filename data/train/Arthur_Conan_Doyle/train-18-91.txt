“Poor little girl,” I exclaimed, looking down at the slim, graceful
figure by my side. “This is no atmosphere for you to live in. Why will
you not let me rescue you from it? Why won't you allow me to go straight
and ask the general for your hand? At the worst he could only refuse.” She turned quite haggard and pale at the very thought. “For Heaven's sake, John,” she cried earnestly, “do nothing of the kind.
He would whip us all away in the dead of the night, and within a week
we should be settling down again in some wilderness where we might never
have a chance of seeing or hearing from you again. Besides, he never
would forgive us for venturing out of the grounds.”
