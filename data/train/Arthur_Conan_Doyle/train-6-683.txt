Only once was the long vigil broken. A woman came forth from the house
and walked up and down, with her face sunk upon her breast. She was tall
and slender, but her features could not be seen for a wimple over her
head. Weary sadness could be read in her bowed back and dragging steps.
Once only they saw her throw her two hands up to Heaven as one who is
beyond human aid. Then she passed slowly into the house again. A moment
later the door of the hall was flung open, and a shouting stumbling
throng came crowding forth, with whoop and yell, into the silent
night. Linking arms and striking up a chorus, they marched past the
peat-cutting, their voices dwindling slowly away as they made for their
homes.
