      explanation to you, Mr. Holmes.”       Holmes replaced the bill in his notebook. “If you prefer a public
      explanation, it must come sooner or later,” said he. “I have
      already told you that I can hush up that which others will be
      bound to publish, and you would really be wiser to take me into
      your complete confidence.”
