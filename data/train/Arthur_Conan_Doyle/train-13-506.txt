      “‘“It’s an old acquaintance of mine who has come down in the
      world,” said she. When I promised her I would say nothing she
      kissed me, and I have never seen her since. I have told you now
      the whole truth, and if I withheld it from the police it is
      because I did not realize then the danger in which my dear friend
      stood. I know that it can only be to her advantage that
      everything should be known.’
