All day the memory of this interview haunted him.  He felt that he had
come very badly out of it.  She had showed herself to be his superior
on his own pet subject.  She had been courteous while he had been rude,
self-possessed when he had been angry.  And then, above all, there was
her presence, her monstrous intrusion to rankle in his mind.  A woman
doctor had been an abstract thing before, repugnant but distant.  Now
she was there in actual practice, with a brass plate up just like his
own, competing for the same patients.  Not that he feared competition,
but he objected to this lowering of his ideal of womanhood.  She could
not be more than thirty, and had a bright, mobile face, too.  He
thought of her humorous eyes, and of her strong, well-turned chin.  It
revolted him the more to recall the details of her education.  A man,
of course, could come through such an ordeal with all his purity, but
it was nothing short of shameless in a woman.
