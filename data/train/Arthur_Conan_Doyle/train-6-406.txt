Edith was on her feet with outstretched arms between them. “Stand back,
Nigel! He is small and weak. You would not do him a hurt! Did you not
say so this very day? For God's sake, Nigel, do not look at him so!
There is death in your eyes.” “A snake may be small and weak, Edith, yet every honest man would place
his heel upon it. Do you stand back yourself, for my purpose is set.” “Paul!” she turned her eyes to the pale sneering face. “Bethink you,
Paul! Why should you not do what he asks? What matter to you whether it
be now or on Monday? I pray you, dear Paul, for my sake let him have his
way! Your brother can read the service again if it so please him. Let us
wed now, Paul, and then all is well.”
