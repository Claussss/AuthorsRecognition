      “The burglar, sir. He was off like a shot and got clean away.
      He’d just broke in at the pantry window when William came on him
      and met his end in saving his master’s property.”       “What time?”       “It was last night, sir, somewhere about twelve.”       “Ah, then, we’ll step over afterwards,” said the Colonel, coolly
      settling down to his breakfast again. “It’s a baddish business,”
      he added when the butler had gone; “he’s our leading man about
      here, is old Cunningham, and a very decent fellow too. He’ll be
      cut up over this, for the man has been in his service for years
      and was a good servant. It’s evidently the same villains who
      broke into Acton’s.”
