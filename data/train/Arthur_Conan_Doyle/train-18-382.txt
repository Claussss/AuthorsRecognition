8.45 P.M.--Just starting for the convoy. May luck go with us! October 5.--Seven o'clock in the evening. _Io triumphe!_ Crown us with
laurel--Elliott and myself! Who can compare with us as vermin killers? I have only just got back, tired and weary, stained with blood and
dust, but I have sat down before either washing or changing to have the
satisfaction of seeing our deeds set forth in black and white--if only
in my private log for no eye but my own. I shall describe it all fully
as a preparation for an official account, which must be drawn up when
Elliott gets back. Billy Dawson used to say that there were three
degrees of comparison--a prevarication, a lie, and an official account.
We at least cannot exaggerate our success, for it would be impossible to
add anything to it.
