I was, as you may readily believe, my dear children, bewildered by this
sudden and most unlooked-for turn which events had taken. When Saxon had
ceased to speak I sat as one stunned, trying to realise what he had said
to me. There came a thought into my head, however, which chilled the
glow of hope and of happiness which had sprung up in me at the thought
of recovering my freedom. My presence had been a support and a comfort
to my unhappy companions. Would it not be a cruel thing to leave them in
their distress? There was not one of them who did not look to me in his
trouble, and to the best of my poor power I had befriended and consoled
them. How could I desert them now?
