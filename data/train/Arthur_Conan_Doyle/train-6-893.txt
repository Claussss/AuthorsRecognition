Varlets had rushed forth to draw away the two dead Bretons, and a brace
of English archers had carried Nigel from the field. With his own hands
Aylward had unlaced the crushed helmet and had wept to see the bloodless
and unconscious face of his young master. He still breathed, however,
and stretched upon the grass by the riverside the bowman tended him with
rude surgery, until the water upon his brow and the wind upon his face
had coaxed back the life into his battered frame. He breathed with heavy
gasps, and some tinge of blood crept hack into his cheeks, but still
he lay unconscious of the roar of the crowd and of that great struggle
which his comrades were now waging once again.
