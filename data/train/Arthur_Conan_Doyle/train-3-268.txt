This led to another leader and considerable abuse. The controversy was, however, by no means one-sided, in spite of the
shadow of the Cathedral. Mr. Peter Trolove is a man of wit as well as
knowledge, and wields a pretty pen. A strong man, also, is Dr. John
Guthrie, whose letter contains words so kindly that I must quote them:      "_Sir Arthur Conan Doyle stands above it all, not only as a
     courteous gentleman, but as a fair controversialist throughout. He
     is, anyhow, a chivalrous and magnanimous personality, whether or
     not his beliefs have any truth. Fancy quoting authorities against a
     man who has spent great part of his life studying the subject, and
     who knows the authorities better than all his opponents put
     together--a man who has deliberately used his great gifts in an
     honest attempt to get at truth. I do think that Christchurch has
     some need to apologise for its controversialists--much more need
     than our distinguished visitor has to apologise for what we all
     know to be his honest convictions._"
