Chapter XII. Of certain Passages upon the Moor In the morning, after a breakfast furnished by the remains of our
supper, we looked to our horses and prepared for our departure. Ere we
could mount, however, our kindly host came running out to us with a load
of armour in his arms. ‘Come hither,’ said he, beckoning to Reuben. ‘It is not meet, lad, that
you should go bare-breasted against the enemy when your comrades are
girt with steel. I have here mine own old breastplate and head-piece,
which should, methinks, fit you, for if you have more flesh than I, I am
a larger framework of a man. Ah, said I not so! Were’t measured for you
by Silas Thomson, the court armourer, it could not grip better. Now
on with the head-piece. A close fit again. You are now a cavalier whom
Monmouth or any other leader might be proud to see ride beneath his
banner.’
