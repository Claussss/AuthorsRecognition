      We all stood still and listened. A low moaning sound was coming
      from somewhere over our heads. Holmes rushed to the door and out
      into the hall. The dismal noise came from upstairs. He dashed up,
      the inspector and I at his heels, while his brother Mycroft
      followed as quickly as his great bulk would permit.       Three doors faced up upon the second floor, and it was from the
      central of these that the sinister sounds were issuing, sinking
      sometimes into a dull mumble and rising again into a shrill
      whine. It was locked, but the key had been left on the outside.
      Holmes flung open the door and rushed in, but he was out again in
      an instant, with his hand to his throat.
