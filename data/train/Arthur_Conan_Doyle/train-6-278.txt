A good man was John Widdicombe, but he had met a better that day. Before
that yellow whirlwind of a horse and that rider who was welded and
riveted to his saddle his knees could not hold their grip. Nigel and
Pommers were one flying missile, with all their weight and strength
and energy centered on the steady end of the lance. Had Widdicombe been
struck by a thunderbolt he could not have flown faster or farther from
his saddle. Two full somersaults did he make, his plates clanging like
cymbals, ere he lay prone upon his back.
