"'This pretended merchant, who travels under the name of Achmet, is now
in the city of Agra, and desires to gain his way into the fort.  He has
with him as travelling-companion my foster-brother Dost Akbar, who
knows his secret.  Dost Akbar has promised this night to lead him to a
side-postern of the fort, and has chosen this one for his purpose.
Here he will come presently, and here he will find Mahomet Singh and
myself awaiting him.  The place is lonely, and none shall know of his
coming.  The world shall know of the merchant Achmet no more, but the
great treasure of the rajah shall be divided among us.  What say you to
it, Sahib?'
