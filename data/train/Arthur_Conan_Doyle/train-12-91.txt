“It may be a long time before he comes, father,” said Robert coldly;
“and when he does I am afraid that I can hardly use his friendship as a
means of advancing your interest.” “We are his equals, father,” cried Laura with spirit. “Would you put us
on the footing of beggars? He would think we cared for him only for his
money. I wonder that you should think of such a thing.” “If I had not thought of such things where would your education have
been, miss?” retorted the angry old man; and Robert stole quietly away
to his room, whence amid his canvases he could still hear the hoarse
voice and the clear in their never-ending family jangle. More and more
sordid seemed the surroundings of his life, and more and more to be
valued the peace which money can buy.
