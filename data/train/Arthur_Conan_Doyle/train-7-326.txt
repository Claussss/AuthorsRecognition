“I wonder that you were not shot without any drumhead court-martial,”
 said the Colonel. “But how in the world did you get here?” “The Haifa people were close upon our track at the time when I was
abandoned, and they picked me up in the desert. I must have been
delirious, I suppose, for they tell me that they heard my voice, singing
hymns, a long way off, and it was that, under the providence of God,
which brought them to me. They had a camel ambulance, and I was quite
myself again by next day. I came with the Sarras people after we met
them, because they have the doctor with them. My wound is nothing, and
he says that a man of my habit will be the better for the loss of blood.
And now, my friends,”--his big, brown eyes lost their twinkle, and
became very solemn and reverent,--“we have all been upon the very
confines of death, and our dear companions may be so at this instant.
The same power which saved us may save them, and let us pray together
that it may be so, always remembering that if, in spite of our prayers,
it should _not_ be so, then that also must be accepted as the best and
wisest thing.”
