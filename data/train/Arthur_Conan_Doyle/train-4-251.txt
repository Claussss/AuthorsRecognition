At this appeal there was much creaking of locks and rasping of bolts,
which ended in the door swinging slowly open, and disclosing the person
who had addressed us. By the strong light which shone out from behind him we could see that
he was a man of venerable aspect, with snow-white hair and a countenance
which bespoke a thoughtful and yet fiery nature. The high pensive brow
and flowing beard smacked of the philosopher, but the keen sparkling
eye, the curved aquiline nose, and the lithe upright figure which the
weight of years had been unable to bend, were all suggestive of the
soldier. His lofty bearing, and his rich though severe costume of black
velvet, were at strange variance with the humble nature of the abode
which he had chosen for his dwelling-place.
