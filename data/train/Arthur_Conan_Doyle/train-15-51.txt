They had strolled along the edge of the foss, and a pit yawned upon the
right of them. "That pit was fourteen foot deep," said the farmer. "What d'ye think we
dug oot from the bottom o't? Weel, it was just the skeleton of a man wi'
a spear by his side. I'm thinkin' he was grippin' it when he died. Now,
how cam' a man wi' a spear doon a hole fourteen foot deep. He wasna'
buried there, for they aye burned their dead. What make ye o' that,
mam?"
