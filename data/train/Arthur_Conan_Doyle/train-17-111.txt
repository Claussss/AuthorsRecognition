Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. “I thought as
much,” said he. “Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for
earrings?” “Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a
lad.” “Hum!” said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. “He is still with
you?” “Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.” “And has your business been attended to in your absence?” “Nothing to complain of, sir. There’s never very much to do of a
morning.”
