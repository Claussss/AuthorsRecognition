The two bodies of camel-men had united, and the Arabs, in their grave,
dignified fashion, were exchanging salutations and experiences,
while the negroes grinned, chattered, and shouted, with the careless
good-humour which even the Koran has not been able to alter. The leader
of the new-comers was a greybeard, a worn, ascetic, high-nosed old
man, abrupt and fierce in his manner, and soldierly in his bearing. The
dragoman groaned when he saw him, and flapped his hands miserably with
the air of a man who sees trouble accumulating upon trouble.
