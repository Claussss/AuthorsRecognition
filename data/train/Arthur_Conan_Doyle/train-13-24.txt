      “I am afraid that whatever theory we state has very grave
      objections to it,” returned my companion. “The police imagine, I
      take it, that this Fitzroy Simpson, having drugged the lad, and
      having in some way obtained a duplicate key, opened the stable
      door and took out the horse, with the intention, apparently, of
      kidnapping him altogether. His bridle is missing, so that Simpson
      must have put this on. Then, having left the door open behind
      him, he was leading the horse away over the moor, when he was
      either met or overtaken by the trainer. A row naturally ensued.
      Simpson beat out the trainer’s brains with his heavy stick
      without receiving any injury from the small knife which Straker
      used in self-defence, and then the thief either led the horse on
      to some secret hiding-place, or else it may have bolted during
      the struggle, and be now wandering out on the moors. That is the
      case as it appears to the police, and improbable as it is, all
      other explanations are more improbable still. However, I shall
      very quickly test the matter when I am once upon the spot, and
      until then I cannot really see how we can get much further than
      our present position.”
