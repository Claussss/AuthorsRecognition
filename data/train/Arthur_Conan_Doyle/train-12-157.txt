Man warm might lose a little of its virtue before it reached Caithness,

be arranged to keep up the temperature. These are a few of my plans for
the future, Robert, and I shall want the co-operation of disinterested
men like yourself in all of them. But how brightly the sun shines, and
how sweet the countryside looks! The world is very beautiful, and
I should like to leave it happier than I found it. Let us walk out
together, Robert, and you will tell me of any fresh cases where I may be
of assistance.”
