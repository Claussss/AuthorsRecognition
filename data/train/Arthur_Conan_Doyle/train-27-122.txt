Holmes rose from his chair. 'Have you nothing to tell me?' 'I have told you everything.' 'Think once more, Lady Brackenstall. Would it not be better to be
frank?' For an instant there was hesitation in her beautiful face. Then some new
strong thought caused it to set like a mask. 'I have told you all I know.' Holmes took his hat and shrugged his shoulders. 'I am sorry,' he said,
and without another word we left the room and the house. There was a
pond in the park, and to this my friend led the way. It was frozen over,
but a single hole was left for the convenience of a solitary swan.
Holmes gazed at it, and then passed on to the lodge gate. There he
scribbled a short note for Stanley Hopkins, and left it with the
lodge-keeper.
