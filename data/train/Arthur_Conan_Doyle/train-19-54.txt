10 P. M.  Well, well, what a thing of straw I am!  I am coming to know
myself better of late, and the more I know the lower I fall in my own
estimation.  Surely I was not always so weak as this.  At four o'clock
I should have smiled had any one told me that I should go to Miss
Penclosa's to-night, and yet, at eight, I was at Wilson's door as
usual.  I don't know how it occurred.  The influence of habit, I
suppose.  Perhaps there is a mesmeric craze as there is an opium craze,
and I am a victim to it.  I only know that as I worked in my study I
became more and more uneasy.  I fidgeted.  I worried.  I could not
concentrate my mind upon the papers in front of me.  And then, at last,
almost before I knew what I was doing, I seized my hat and hurried
round to keep my usual appointment.
