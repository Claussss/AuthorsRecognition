“Your friend seems to be no fool,” remarked Holmes. “No, sir, White Mason is a very live man, if I am any judge.” “Well, have you anything more?” “Only that he will give us every detail when we meet.” “Then how did you get at Mr. Douglas and the fact that he had been
horribly murdered?” “That was in the inclosed official report. It didn't say 'horrible':
that's not a recognized official term. It gave the name John Douglas. It
mentioned that his injuries had been in the head, from the discharge of
a shotgun. It also mentioned the hour of the alarm, which was close on
to midnight last night. It added that the case was undoubtedly one of
murder, but that no arrest had been made, and that the case was one
which presented some very perplexing and extraordinary features. That's
absolutely all we have at present, Mr. Holmes.”
