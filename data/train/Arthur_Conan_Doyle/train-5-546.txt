"Now, I'll take a case which I had in my own practice last Wednesday.
A lady came in to consult me--the wife of a well-known sporting
baronet.  The husband had come with her, but remained, at her request,
in the waiting-room.  I need not go into details, but it proved to be a
peculiarly malignant case of cancer.  'I knew it,' said she.  'How long
have I to live?'  'I fear that it may exhaust your strength in a few
months,' I answered.  'Poor old Jack!' said she.  'I'll tell him that
it is not dangerous.'  'Why should you deceive him?' I asked.  'Well,
he's very uneasy about it, and he is quaking now in the waiting-room.
He has two old friends to dinner to-night, and I haven't the heart to
spoil his evening.  To-morrow will be time enough for him to learn the
truth.'  Out she walked, the brave little woman, and a moment later her
husband, with his big, red face shining with joy came plunging into my
room to shake me by the hand.  No, I respected her wish and I did not
undeceive him.  I dare bet that evening was one of the brightest, and
the next morning the darkest, of his life.
