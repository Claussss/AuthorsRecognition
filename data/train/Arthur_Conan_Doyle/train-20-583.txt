      As Holmes drew the curtain I was aware, from some little rigidity
      and alertness of his attitude, that he was prepared for an
      emergency. As a matter of fact, the drawn curtain disclosed
      nothing but three or four suits of clothes hanging from a line of
      pegs. Holmes turned away, and stooped suddenly to the floor.       “Halloa! What’s this?” said he.       It was a small pyramid of black, putty-like stuff, exactly like
      the one upon the table of the study. Holmes held it out on his
      open palm in the glare of the electric light.
