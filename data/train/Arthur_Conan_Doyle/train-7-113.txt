The Colonel had not understood this sudden change, nor had the others
fathomed the reason of it, but some instinct flashed it upon Stephens's
horrified perceptions. “Oh, you villain!” he cried, furiously. “Hold your tongue, you miserable creature! Be silent! Better die--a
thousand times better die!” But it was too late, and already they could all see the base design by
which the coward hoped to save his own life. He was about to betray the
women. They saw the chief, with a brave man's contempt upon his stern
face, make a sign of haughty assent, and then Mansoor spoke rapidly and
earnestly, pointing up the hill. At a word from the Baggara, a dozen of
the raiders rushed up the path and were lost to view upon the top. Then
came a shrill cry, a horrible, strenuous scream of surprise and terror,
and an instant later the party streamed into sight again, dragging the
women in their midst. Sadie, with her young, active limbs, kept up with
them as they sprang down the slope, encouraging her aunt all the while
over her shoulder. The older lady, struggling amid the rushing white
figures, looked with her thin limbs and open mouth like a chicken being
dragged from a coop.
