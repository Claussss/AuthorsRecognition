I am feeling wonderfully fit and well.  I don't think I ever lectured
with greater spirit.  Oh, if I could only get this shadow off my life,
how happy I should be!  Young, fairly wealthy, in the front rank of my
profession, engaged to a beautiful and charming girl--have I not every
thing which a man could ask for?  Only one thing to trouble me, but
what a thing it is! Midnight.  I shall go mad.  Yes, that will be the end of it.  I shall
go mad.  I am not far from it now.  My head throbs as I rest it on my
hot hand.  I am quivering all over like a scared horse.  Oh, what a
night I have had!  And yet I have some cause to be satisfied also.
