Abbot John rose to stretch his cramped limbs. He looked out at the
greensward of the cloister, and at the graceful line of open Gothic
arches which skirted a covered walk for the brethren within. Two and two
in their black-and-white garb with slow step and heads inclined, they
paced round and round. Several of the more studious had brought their
illuminating work from the scriptorium, and sat in the warm sunshine
with their little platters of pigments and packets of gold-leaf before
them, their shoulders rounded and their faces sunk low over the white
sheets of vellum. There too was the copper-worker with his burin and
graver. Learning and art were not traditions with the Cistercians
as with the parent Order of the Benedictines, and yet the library
of Waverley was well filled both with precious books and with pious
students.
