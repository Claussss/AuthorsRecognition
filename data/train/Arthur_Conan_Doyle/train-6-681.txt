“Simon, your words are neither good nor fair. When we are back on
shipboard we will speak further of this matter. Now lead on, I pray you,
and let us see some more of this ten-devil island.” For half a mile Simon led the way until they came to a large house which
stood by itself. Peering at it from the edge of the cutting, Aylward
could see that it was made from the wreckage of many vessels, for at
each corner a prow was thrust out. Lights blazed within, and there came
the sound of a strong voice singing a gay song which was taken up by a
dozen others in the chorus.
