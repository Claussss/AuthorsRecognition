      â€œThe Cunninghams joined us, as you doubtless remember, outside
      the kitchen door. It was, of course, of the very first importance
      that they should not be reminded of the existence of this paper,
      otherwise they would naturally destroy it without delay. The
      Inspector was about to tell them the importance which we attached
      to it when, by the luckiest chance in the world, I tumbled down
      in a sort of fit and so changed the conversation.
