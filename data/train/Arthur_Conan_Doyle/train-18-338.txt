“We can do nothing until daybreak,” he answered. “We shall then
endeavour to obtain some trace of them. It is hopeless at present.” “And how about Gabriel and Mrs. Heatherstone?” I asked. “Can we
not bring them down from the Hall at once? Your poor sister must be
distracted with terror.” “She knows nothing of it,” Mordaunt answered. “She sleeps at the other
side of the house, and has not heard or seen anything. As to my poor
mother, she has expected some such event for so long a time that it has
not come upon her as a surprise. She is, of course, overwhelmed with
grief, but would, I think, prefer to be left to herself for the
present. Her firmness and composure should be a lesson to me, but I am
constitutionally excitable, and this catastrophe coming after our long
period of suspense deprived me of my very reason for a time.”
