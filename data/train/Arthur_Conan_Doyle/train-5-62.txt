The old man laughed until he coughed.  "Like to see me, would they?
The dogs!" said he.  "Well, well, when the warm weather comes again
I'll maybe drop in.  Too grand for a canteen, eh?  Got your mess just
the same as the orficers.  What's the world a-comin' to at all!" "You was in the line, sir, was you not?" asked the sergeant
respectfully. "The line?" cried the old man, with shrill scorn.  "Never wore a shako
in my life.  I am a guardsman, I am.  Served in the Third Guards--the
same they call now the Scots Guards.  Lordy, but they have all marched
away--every man of them--from old Colonel Byng down to the drummer
boys, and here am I a straggler--that's what I am, sergeant, a
straggler!  I'm here when I ought to be there.  But it ain't my fault
neither, for I'm ready to fall in when the word comes."
