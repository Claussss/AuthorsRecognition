So lie the dead leaves; but they and such as they nourish forever that
great old trunk of England, which still sheds forth another crop and
another, each as strong and as fair as the last. The body may lie in
moldering chancel, or in crumbling vault, but the rumor of noble lives,
the record of valor and truth, can never die, but lives on in the
soul of the people. Our own work lies ready to our hands; and yet our
strength may be the greater and our faith the firmer if we spare an
hour from present toils to look back upon the women who were gentle and
strong, or the men who loved honor more than life, on this green stage
of England where for a few short years we play our little part.
