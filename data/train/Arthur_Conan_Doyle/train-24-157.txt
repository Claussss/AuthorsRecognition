“We have had enough bobance and boasting,” said Hordle John, rising and
throwing off his doublet. “I will show you that there are better men
left in England than ever went thieving to France.” “Pasques Dieu!” cried the archer, loosening his jerkin, and eyeing his

“I have only once before seen such a body of a man. By your leave, my
red-headed friend, I should be right sorry to exchange buffets with
you; and I will allow that there is no man in the Company who would
pull against you on a rope; so let that be a salve to your pride. On
the other hand I should judge that you have led a life of ease for some
months back, and that my muscle is harder than your own. I am ready to
wager upon myself against you if you are not afeard.”
