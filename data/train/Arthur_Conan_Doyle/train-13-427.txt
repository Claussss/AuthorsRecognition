      “The matter grows in interest,” said he. “Watson, your
      country-trip has been a distinct success. I have had a charming
      morning.”       “You have been up to the scene of the crime, I understand,” said
      the Colonel.       “Yes; the Inspector and I have made quite a little reconnaissance
      together.”       “Any success?”       “Well, we have seen some very interesting things. I’ll tell you
      what we did as we walk. First of all, we saw the body of this
      unfortunate man. He certainly died from a revolver wound as
      reported.”
