“Do you know what I am thinking of all the time?” said Sadie. “You
remember that temple that we saw,--when was it? Why, it was this
morning.” They gave an exclamation of surprise, all three of them. Yes, it
had been this morning; and it seemed away and away in some dim past
experience of their lives, so vast was the change, so new and so
overpowering the thoughts which had come between them. They rode in
silence, full of this strange expansion of time, until at last Stephens
reminded Sadie that she had left her remark unfinished.
