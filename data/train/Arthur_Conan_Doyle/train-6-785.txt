“Indeed Raoul, no man could have carried himself with more honor or won
more worship than you have done this day. I will do your behest when the
time comes.” “Surely you are happy, Nigel,” the dying Squire murmured, “for this
day has given you one more deed which you may lay at the feet of your
lady-love.” “It might have been so had we carried the gate,” Nigel answered sadly;
“but by Saint Paul! I cannot count it a deed where I have come back with
my purpose unfulfilled. But this is no time, Raoul, to talk of my
small affairs. If we take the castle and I bear a good part in it, then
perchance all this may indeed avail.”
