Here we are at the final seance. For the last time, my patient
comrade, I ask you to make yourself comfortable upon the old green
settee, to look up at the oaken shelves, and to bear with me as best
you may while I preach about their contents. The last time! And yet,
as I look along the lines of the volumes, I have not mentioned one
out of ten of those to which I owe a debt of gratitude, nor one in
a hundred of the thoughts which course through my brain as I look
at them. As well perhaps, for the man who has said all that he has
to say has invariably said too much.
