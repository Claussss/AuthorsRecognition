      â€œSome weeks ago Mr. Blessington came down to me in, as it seemed
      to me, a state of considerable agitation. He spoke of some
      burglary which, he said, had been committed in the West End, and
      he appeared, I remember, to be quite unnecessarily excited about
      it, declaring that a day should not pass before we should add
      stronger bolts to our windows and doors. For a week he continued
      to be in a peculiar state of restlessness, peering continually
      out of the windows, and ceasing to take the short walk which had
      usually been the prelude to his dinner. From his manner it struck
      me that he was in mortal dread of something or somebody, but when
      I questioned him upon the point he became so offensive that I was
      compelled to drop the subject. Gradually, as time passed, his
      fears appeared to die away, and he had renewed his former habits,
      when a fresh event reduced him to the pitiable state of
      prostration in which he now lies.
