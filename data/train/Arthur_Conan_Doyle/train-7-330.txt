The Dervishes--or what was left of them--were riding slowly some
little distance out in a confused crowd, their patchwork jibbehs and red
turbans swaying with the motion of their camels. They did not present
the appearance of men who were defeated, for their movements were very
deliberate, but they looked about them and changed their formation as
if they were uncertain what their tactics ought to be. It was no wonder
that they were puzzled, for upon their spent camels their situation was
as hopeless as could be conceived. The Sarras men had all emerged from
the khor, and had dismounted, the beasts being held in groups of four,
while the riflemen knelt in a long line with a woolly, curling fringe
of smoke, sending volley after volley at the Arabs, who shot back in a
desultory fashion from the backs of their camels. But it was not upon
the sullen group of Dervishes, nor yet upon the long line of kneeling
riflemen, that the eyes of the spectators were fixed. Far out upon the
desert, three squadrons of the Haifa Camel Corps were coming up in
a dense close column, which wheeled beautifully into a widespread
semicircle as it approached. The Arabs were caught between two fires.
