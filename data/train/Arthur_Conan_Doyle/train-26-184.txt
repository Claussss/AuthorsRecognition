  "The ever to be lamented death of Lord Viscount Nelson, Duke
  of Bronte, the Commander-in-Chief, who fell in the action of
  the 21st, in the arms of Victory, covered with glory, whose
  memory will be ever dear to the British Navy and the British
  Nation; whose zeal for the honour of his king and for the
  interests of his country will be ever held up as a shining
  example for a British seaman--leaves to me a duty to return
  thanks, etc., etc."
