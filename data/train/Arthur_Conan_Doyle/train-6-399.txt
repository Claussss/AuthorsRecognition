Paul de la Fosse looked up at her with a quick smile and patted the hand
upon his shoulder. “Do you speak to them, Edith,” said he. Her eyes flashed with scorn as she surveyed them each in turn, the
woman, the youth and the priest. “I have but one word to say to them,” said she. “It is that they go
hence and trouble us no more. Am I not a free woman? Have I not said
that this is the only man I ever loved? I have loved him long. He did
not know it, and in despair he turned to another. Now he knows all and
never again can doubt come between us. Therefore I will stay here at
Shalford and come to Cosford no more save upon the arm of my husband.
Am I so weak that I would believe the tales you tell against him? Is it
hard for a jealous woman and a wandering priest to agree upon a lie? No,
no, Mary, you can go hence and take your cavalier and your priest with
you, for here I stay, true to my love and safe in my trust upon his
honor!”
