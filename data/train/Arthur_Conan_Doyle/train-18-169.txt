Mysakes! it didna tak lang for me tae drap doon amang the cairpets again
and cover mysel' ower. There I lay tremblin' in every limb, and sayin'
as mony prayers as I could mind, wi' my e'e still peepin' through the
keek-hole, and fixed upon the door o' the general's room. I heard the rattle o' the handle presently, and the door swung slowly
open. There was a licht burnin' in the room beyond, an' I could just
catch a glimpse o' what seemed tae me like a row o' swords stuck alang
the side o' the wa', when the general stepped oot and shut the door
behind him. He was dressed in a dressin' goon, wi' a red smokin'-cap
on his heid, and a pair o' slippers wi' the heels cut off and the taes
turned up.
