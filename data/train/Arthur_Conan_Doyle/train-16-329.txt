"Gentlemen," cried the surgeon in a voice as hard and brisk as his
manner. "We have here an interesting case of tumour of the parotid,
originally cartilaginous but now assuming malignant characteristics, and
therefore requiring excision. On to the table, nurse! Thank you!
Chloroform, clerk! Thank you! You can take the shawl off, nurse." The woman lay back upon the waterproofed pillow and her murderous tumour
lay revealed. In itself it was a pretty thing, ivory white with a mesh
of blue veins, and curving gently from jaw to chest. But the lean,
yellow face, and the stringy throat were in horrible contrast with the
plumpness and sleekness of this monstrous growth. The surgeon placed a
hand on each side of it and pressed it slowly backwards and forwards.
