      Mr. Holmes,” said he at last, “I’m sure you don’t really mean

      heavy, sullen expression upon his strongly-marked face. The son,

      which had characterized him, and the ferocity of a dangerous wild
      beast gleamed in his dark eyes and distorted his handsome
      features. The Inspector said nothing, but, stepping to the door,
      he blew his whistle. Two of his constables came at the call.
