‘They are ordering the line for the attack,’ said Saxon, who had ridden
up during our conversation. ‘Donnerblitz! Who ever saw a camp so
exposed to an onfall? Oh for twelve hundred good horse--for an hour of
Wessenburg’s Pandours! Would I not trample them down until their camp
was like a field of young corn after a hail-storm!’ ‘May not our horse advance?’ I asked. The old soldier gave a deep snort of disdain. ‘If this fight is to be
won it must be by our foot,’ said he; ‘what can we hope for from such
cavalry? Keep your men well in hand, for we may have to bear the brunt
of the King’s dragoons. A flank attack would fall upon us, for we are in
the post of honour.’
