‘And what came of it?’ I asked, for our new acquaintance was laughing
silently to himself. ‘Well, my three friends ran down their hare, and pulled out their
flasks, as men who had done a good stroke of work. They were still
hobnobbing and laughing over the slaughtered bunny, and one had
dismounted to cut off its ears as the prize of their chase, when I came
up at a hand-gallop. “Good-morrow, gentlemen,” said I, “we have had rare
sport.” They looked at me blankly enough, I promise you, and one of
them asked me what the devil I did there, and how I dared to join in a
private sport. “Nay, I was not chasing your hare, gentlemen,” said I.
“What then, fellow?” asked one of them. “Why, marry, I was chasing you,”
 I answered, “and a better run I have not had for years.” With that I
lugged out my persuaders, and made the thing clear in a few words, and
I’ll warrant you would have laughed could you have seen their faces as
they slowly dragged the fat leather purses from their fobs. Seventy-one
pounds was my prize that morning, which was better worth riding for than
a hare’s ears.’
