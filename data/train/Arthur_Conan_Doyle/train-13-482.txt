      â€œColonel Barclay had married at the time when he was a sergeant,
      and his wife, whose maiden name was Miss Nancy Devoy, was the
      daughter of a former colour-sergeant in the same corps. There
      was, therefore, as can be imagined, some little social friction
      when the young couple (for they were still young) found
      themselves in their new surroundings. They appear, however, to
      have quickly adapted themselves, and Mrs. Barclay has always, I
      understand, been as popular with the ladies of the regiment as
      her husband was with his brother officers. I may add that she was
      a woman of great beauty, and that even now, when she has been
      married for upwards of thirty years, she is still of a striking
      and queenly appearance.
