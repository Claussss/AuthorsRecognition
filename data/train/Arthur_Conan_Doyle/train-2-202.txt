“That is so, Mr. Holmes, though the matter is past and done with. We
were a family of tin-miners at Redruth, but we sold our venture to a
company, and so retired with enough to keep us. I won’t deny that there
was some feeling about the division of the money and it stood between
us for a time, but it was all forgiven and forgotten, and we were the
best of friends together.” “Looking back at the evening which you spent together, does anything
stand out in your memory as throwing any possible light upon the
tragedy? Think carefully, Mr. Tregennis, for any clue which can help
me.”
