      “Footprints?”       “Footprints.”       “A man’s or a woman’s?”       Dr. Mortimer looked strangely at us for an instant, and his voice
      sank almost to a whisper as he answered.       “Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound!” The Problem       I confess at these words a shudder passed through me. There was a
      thrill in the doctor’s voice which showed that he was himself
      deeply moved by that which he told us. Holmes leaned forward in
      his excitement and his eyes had the hard, dry glitter which shot
      from them when he was keenly interested.
