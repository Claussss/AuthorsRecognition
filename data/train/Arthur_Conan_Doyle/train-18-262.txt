I was about to make some reply when the mate burst into a loud guffaw,
slapping his thigh and choking with merriment. “If you want to bury them,” he said, “you had best look sharp, or they
may clear out of the country. You remember what I said last night? Just
look at the top of that 'ere hillock, and tell me whether I was in the
right or not?” There was a high sand dune some little distance along the coast, and
upon the summit of this the figure was standing which had attracted the
mate's attention. The captain threw up his hands in astonishment as his
eyes rested upon it.
