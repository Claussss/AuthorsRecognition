“Who were they?” I asked. “I could not have believed that it was
possible for men to appear so unconcerned in the face of such imminent
peril.” “As to who they are or were,” the captain answered, puffing thoughtfully
at his pipe, “that is by no means easy to say. Our last port was
Kurrachee, in the north of India, and there we took them aboard as
passengers for Glasgow. Ram Singh was the name of the younger, and it is
only with him that I have come in contact, but they all appeared to be
quiet, inoffensive gentlemen. I never inquired their business, but I
should judge that they were Parsee merchants from Hyderabad whose trade
took them to Europe. I could never see why the crew should fear them,
and the mate, too, he should have had more sense.”
