“You know not the truth of this matter,” said the Abbot. “If you are
a loyal man, you will stand aside, for this young man hath grievously
offended against the law, and it is for the King's lieges to give us
their support.” “And you have haled him up for judgment,” cried the stranger with much
amusement. “It is as though a rookery sat in judgment upon a falcon. I
warrant that you have found it easier to judge than to punish. Let me
tell you, father Abbot, that this standeth not aright. When powers such
as these were given to the like of you, they were given that you might
check a brawling underling or correct a drunken woodman, and not that
you might drag the best blood in England to your bar and set your
archers on him if he questioned your findings.”
