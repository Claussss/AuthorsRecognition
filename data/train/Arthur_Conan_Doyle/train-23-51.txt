Let us now consider the life in the Beyond as it is shown to us by the
new revelation. 
CHAPTER IV THE COMING WORLD 
We come first to the messages which tell us of the life beyond the
grave, sent by those who are actually living it.  I have already
insisted upon the fact that they have three weighty claims to our
belief.  The one is, that they are accompanied by "signs," in the
Biblical sense, in the shape of "miracles" or phenomena.  The second
is, that in many cases they are accompanied by assertions about this
life of ours which prove to be correct, and which are beyond the
possible knowledge of the medium after every deduction has been made
for telepathy or for unconscious memory.  The third is, that they have
a remarkable, though not a complete, similarity from whatever source
they come.
