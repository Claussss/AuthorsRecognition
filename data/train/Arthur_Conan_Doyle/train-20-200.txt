      “I think, gentlemen,” said Holmes, quietly, “that we had best
      take up our position behind the door. Every precaution is
      necessary when dealing with such a fellow. You will need your
      handcuffs, Inspector. You can leave the talking to me.”       We waited in silence for a minute—one of those minutes which one
      can never forget. Then the door opened and the man stepped in. In
      an instant Holmes clapped a pistol to his head, and Martin
      slipped the handcuffs over his wrists. It was all done so swiftly
      and deftly that the fellow was helpless before he knew that he
      was attacked. He glared from one to the other of us with a pair
      of blazing black eyes. Then he burst into a bitter laugh.
