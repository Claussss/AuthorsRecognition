Never for an hour, night or day, have they suffered me to forget that
they have marked me down as their victim. Their accursed astral bell has
been ringing my knell for two-score years, reminding me ever that there
is no spot upon earth where I can hope to be in safety. Oh, the peace,
the blessed peace of dissolution! Come what may on the other side of the
tomb, I shall at least be quit of that thrice terrible sound.
