and turning so fiercely upon the timid burgher, that he lost the little
balance of wits which was left to him. ‘Why, the rhine, your Grace, your Majesty,’ he quavered. ‘The rhine,
which, as your Majesty’s Grace cannot but perceive, is what the country
folk call the rhine.’ ‘It is a name, your Majesty, for the deep and broad ditches which drain
off the water from the great morass of Sedgemoor,’ said Sir Stephen
Timewell.
