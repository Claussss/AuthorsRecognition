string is overshort or the stave overlong. It could not by chance be the

the center in his right hand, leaned the end on the inside of his right
foot, and then, pulling the upper nock down with the left hand, slid
the eye of the string easily into place. “Now I pray thee to unstring it
again,” handing it to the bowman.
