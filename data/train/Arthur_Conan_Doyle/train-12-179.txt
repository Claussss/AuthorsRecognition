“I will accept him.” “You were always a good girl, Laura,” said old McIntyre, standing on his
tiptoes to kiss her. “But Laura, Laura, how about Hector?” asked Robert in mild remonstrance. “Oh, I have written to him,” his sister answered carelessly. “I wish you
would be good enough to post the letter.” 
CHAPTER X. THE GREAT SECRET. 
And so Laura McIntyre became duly engaged to Raffles Haw, and old
McIntyre grew even more hungry-looking as he felt himself a step nearer
to the source of wealth, while Robert thought less of work than ever,
and never gave as much as a thought to the great canvas which still
stood, dust-covered, upon his easel. Haw gave Laura an engagement ring
of old gold, with a great blazing diamond bulging out of it. There was
little talk about the matter, however, for it was Haw's wish that all
should be done very quietly. Nearly all his evenings were spent at
Elmdene, where he and Laura would build up the most colossal schemes of
philanthropy for the future. With a map stretched out on the table in
front of them, these two young people would, as it were, hover over the
world, planning, devising, and improving.
