“And where is that?” asked Percy. “'Fore God, Astley, it is in my mind
that we ride with one who knows more of war than you or I, and that we
would be wise to be guided by his rede. Tell us then what is in your
mind.” “Thirty miles from here,” said Knolles, “there is, as I am told, a
fortalice named Ploermel, and within it is one Bambro', an Englishman,
with a good garrison. No great distance from him is the Castle of
Josselin where dwells Robert of Beaumanoir with a great following of
Bretons. It is my intention that we should join Bambro', and so be in
such strength that we may throw ourselves upon Josselin, and by taking
it become the masters of all mid-Brittany, and able to make head against
the Frenchmen in the south.”
