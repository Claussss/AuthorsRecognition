‘Sir,’ cried the gauger, raising himself upon his elbow, ‘I do hereby
arrest you on the charge of being a traitor, a promoter of treason, a
vagrant, and a masterless man within the meaning of the fourth statute

warrant.’ ‘Brace up his jaw with your scarf, Jim,’ said Murgatroyd. ‘When Venables

looking at the back of my papers, ‘it is marked, as you say, “From James
the Second of England, known lately as the Duke of Monmouth, to Henry
Duke of Beaufort, President of Wales, by the hand of Captain Micah
Clarke, of Saxon’s regiment of Wiltshire foot.” Cast off the lashings,
Dicon. So, Captain, you are a free man once more, and I grieve that we
should have unwittingly harmed you. We are good Lutherans to a man, and
would rather speed you than hinder you on this mission.’
