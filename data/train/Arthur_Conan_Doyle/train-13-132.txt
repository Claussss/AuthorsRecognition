      “As a medical man, you are aware, Watson, that there is no part
      of the body which varies so much as the human ear. Each ear is as
      a rule quite distinctive and differs from all other ones. In last
      year’s _Anthropological Journal_ you will find two short
      monographs from my pen upon the subject. I had, therefore,
      examined the ears in the box with the eyes of an expert and had
      carefully noted their anatomical peculiarities. Imagine my
      surprise, then, when on looking at Miss Cushing I perceived that
      her ear corresponded exactly with the female ear which I had just
      inspected. The matter was entirely beyond coincidence. There was
      the same shortening of the pinna, the same broad curve of the
      upper lobe, the same convolution of the inner cartilage. In all
      essentials it was the same ear.
