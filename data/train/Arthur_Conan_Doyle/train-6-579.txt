“But not yet, I trust, honored sir?” “No, not yet, Nigel. You are still in time to win your spurs even as
your fathers did. How is your strength?” “I am ready for any task, my good and honored lord.” “It is well, for work awaits us--good work, pressing work, work of peril
and of honor. Your eyes shine and your face flushes, Nigel. I live my
own youth over again as I look at you. Know then that though there is
truce with the French here, there is not truce in Brittany where the
houses of Blois and of Montfort still struggle for the dukedom. Half
Brittany fights for one, and half for the other. The French have taken
up the cause of Blois, and we of Montfort, and it is such a war that
many a great leader, such as Sir Walter Manny, has first earned his name
there. Of late the war has gone against us, and the bloody hands of the
Rohans, of Gaptooth Beaumanoir, of Oliver the Flesher and others have
been heavy upon our people. The last tidings have been of disaster,
and the King's soul is dark with wrath for that his friend and comrade
Gilles de St. Pol has been done to death in the Castle of La Brohiniere.
He will send succors to the country, and we go at their head. How like
you that, Nigel?”
