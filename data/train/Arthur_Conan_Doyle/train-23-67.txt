"Some cannot advance further than the borderland--such as never thought
of spirit life and have lived entirely for the earth, its cares and
pleasures--even clever men and women, who have lived simply
intellectual lives without spirituality.  There are many who have
misused their opportunities, and are now longing for the time misspent
and wishing to recall the earth-life.  They will learn that on this
side the time can be redeemed, though at much cost.  The borderland has
many among the restless money-getters of earth, who still haunt the
places where they had their hopes and joys.  These are often the
longest to remain . . . many are not unhappy.  They feel the relief to
be sufficient to be without their earth bodies.  All pass through the
borderland, but some hardly perceive it.  It is so immediate, and there
is no resting there for them.  They pass on at once to the refreshment
place of which we tell you."  The anonymous author, after recording
this spirit message, mentions the interesting fact that there is a
Christian inscription in the Catacombs which runs:  NICEFORUS ANIMA
DULCIS IN REFRIGERIO, "Nicephorus, a sweet soul in the refreshment
place."  One more scrap of evidence that the early Christian scheme of
things was very like that of the modern psychic.
