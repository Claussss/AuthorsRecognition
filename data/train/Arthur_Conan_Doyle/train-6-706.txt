“Your enemies might find some harsher name for it,” said Astley with
a sneer. “Nay, you need not think to scare me by glaring at me, Sir
Robert, nor will your ill-pleasure change my thoughts. I have faced

“and if I were a free man I would cram your words down your throat with
the point of my dagger. But I am here to lead these men in profit and
honor, not to quarrel with every fool who has not the wit to understand
how soldiers should be led. Can you not see that if I make attempts here
and there, as you would have me do, I shall have weakened my strength
before I come to that part where it can best be spent?”
