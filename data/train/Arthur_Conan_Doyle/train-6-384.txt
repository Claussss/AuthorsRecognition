Nigel chatted in a low tone with the priest. From him he learned more of
the evil name of this man whom they followed. His house at Shalford was
a den of profligacy and vice. No woman could cross that threshold and
depart unstained. In some strange fashion, inexplicable and yet common,
the man, with all his evil soul and his twisted body, had yet some
strange fascination for women, some mastery over them which compelled
them to his will. Again and again he had brought ruin to a household,
again and again his adroit tongue and his cunning wit had in some
fashion saved him from the punishment of his deeds. His family was great
in the county, and his kinsmen held favor with the King, so that his
neighbors feared to push things too far against him. Such was the man,
malignant and ravenous, who had stooped like some foul night-hawk and
borne away to his evil nest the golden beauty of Cosford. Nigel said
little as he listened, but he raised his hunting-dagger to his tightened
lips, and thrice he kissed the cross of its handle.
