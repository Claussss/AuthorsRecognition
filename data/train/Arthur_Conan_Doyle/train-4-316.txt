‘Prythee, good dame, how runs your own fancy?’ asked Reuben
mischievously. ‘Not in the direction of fat, young man,’ she answered smartly, with a
merry glance at our plump companion. ‘She has hit you there, Reuben,’ said I. ‘I would have no pert young springald,’ she continued, ‘but one who hath
knowledge of the world, and ripe experience. Tall he should be, and of
sinewy build, free of speech that he might lighten the weary hours, and
help entertain the gentles when they crack a flagon of wine. Of business
habits he must be, too, forsooth, for is there not a busy hostel and two
hundred good pounds a year to pass through his fingers? If Jane Hobson
is to be led to the altar again it must be by such a man as this.’
