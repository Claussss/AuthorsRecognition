4.30 P. M.  Ah, that accursed woman!  That thrice accursed woman!
Never mind!  She shall not beat me!  No, she shall not!  But, oh, the
she-devil!  She has taken my professorship.  Now she would take my
honor.  Is there nothing I can do against her, nothing save---- Ah,
but, hard pushed as I am, I cannot bring myself to think of that! It was about an hour ago that I went into my bedroom, and was brushing
my hair before the glass, when suddenly my eyes lit upon something
which left me so sick and cold that I sat down upon the edge of the bed
and began to cry.  It is many a long year since I shed tears, but all
my nerve was gone, and I could but sob and sob in impotent grief and
anger.  There was my house jacket, the coat I usually wear after
dinner, hanging on its peg by the wardrobe, with the right sleeve
thickly crusted from wrist to elbow with daubs of green paint.
