“How chanced it at Poictiers, good Master Aylward?” asked one of the
young archers, leaning upon his elbows, with his eyes fixed respectfully
upon the old bowman's rugged face. “Aye, Aylward, tell us of it,” cried Hordle John. “Here is to old Samkin Aylward!” shouted several at the further end of
the room, waving their blackjacks in the air. “Ask him!” said Aylward modestly, nodding towards Black Simon. “He saw
more than I did. And yet, by the holy nails! there was not very much
that I did not see either.”
