“In former days these laws acted so instantaneously that the slayer
perished with his victim. It was judged afterwards that this prompt
retribution prevented the offender from having time to realise the
enormity of his offence. “It was therefore ordained that in all such cases the retribution should
be left in the hands of the _chelas_, or immediate disciples of the
holy man, with power to extend or shorten it at their will, exacting
it either at the time or at any future anniversary of the day when the
crime was committed.
