      “Perhaps he was not so strong as you suppose. I should think he
      may have had some secret trouble. With your assent, I will put
      one or two of these papers in my pocket, in case they should bear
      upon our future inquiry.”       “One moment—one moment!” cried a querulous voice, and we looked
      up to find a queer little old man, jerking and twitching in the
      doorway. He was dressed in rusty black, with a very broad-brimmed
      top-hat and a loose white necktie—the whole effect being that of
      a very rustic parson or of an undertaker’s mute. Yet, in spite of
      his shabby and even absurd appearance, his voice had a sharp
      crackle, and his manner a quick intensity which commanded
      attention.
