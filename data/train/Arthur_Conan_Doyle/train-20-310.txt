      Holmes'-map       HOLMES’ MAP OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE SCHOOL.       “Look at this map. This dark square is the Priory School. I’ll
      put a pin in it. Now, this line is the main road. You see that it
      runs east and west past the school, and you see also that there
      is no side road for a mile either way. If these two folk passed
      away by road, it was _this_ road.”       “Exactly.”
