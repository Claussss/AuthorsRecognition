Ashford--” began the Bowyer. “Nay, nay, we have heard that story!” said old Wat impatiently. “Shut
thy clap, Bartholomew, for it is no time for redeless gossip! Walk down
the line, I pray you, and see if there be no frayed string, nor broken
nock nor loosened whipping to be mended.” The stout bowyer passed down the fringe of bowmen, amidst a running fire
of rough wit. Here and there a bow was thrust out at him through the
hedge for his professional advice.
