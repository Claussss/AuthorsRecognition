“Enough!” cried the Abbot sternly. “Lay aside this foolish fashion of
speech and say straitly what you desire.” “Holy father, I have been the officer of the King's law no less than the
servant of Holy Church, and I have been let, hindered and assaulted in
the performance of my lawful and proper duties, whilst my papers, drawn
in the King's name, have been shended and rended and cast to the wind.
Therefore, I demand justice upon this man in the Abbey court, the
said assault having been committed within the banlieue of the Abbey's
jurisdiction.”
