      “The second floor is inhabited by Daulat Ras, the Indian. He is a
      quiet, inscrutable fellow; as most of those Indians are. He is
      well up in his work, though his Greek is his weak subject. He is
      steady and methodical.       “The top floor belongs to Miles McLaren. He is a brilliant fellow
      when he chooses to work—one of the brightest intellects of the
      university; but he is wayward, dissipated, and unprincipled. He
      was nearly expelled over a card scandal in his first year. He has
      been idling all this term, and he must look forward with dread to
      the examination.”
