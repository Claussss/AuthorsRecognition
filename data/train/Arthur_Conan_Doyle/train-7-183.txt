“Well, go on!” “You know the black man who spoke with you--the one who had been with
Hicks?” “Yes, what of him?” “He has been speaking with me during the night. I have had a long talk
with him. He said that he could not very well understand you, nor you
him, and so he came to me.” “What did he say?” “He said that there were eight Egyptian soldiers among the Arabs--six
black and two fellaheen. He said that he wished to have your promise
that they should all have very good reward if they helped you to
escape.”
