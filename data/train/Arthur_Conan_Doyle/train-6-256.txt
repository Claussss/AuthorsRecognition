“Well flown, Margot! Good bird!” cried the King, clapping his hands
to encourage the hawk, while the falconers broke into the shrill whoop
peculiar to the sport. Going on her curve, the hawk would soon have crossed the path of the
heron; but the latter, seeing the danger in his front and confident in
his own great strength of wing and lightness of body, proceeded to mount
higher in the air, flying in such small rings that to the spectators it
almost seemed as if the bird was going perpendicularly upward.
