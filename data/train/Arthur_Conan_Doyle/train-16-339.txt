It was only ten o'clock. The dull roar of the traffic which converged
all day upon London Bridge had died away now to a mere confused murmur.
It was raining heavily, and the gas shone dimly through the streaked and
dripping glass, throwing little yellow circles upon the glistening
cobblestones. The air was full of the sounds of rain, the thin swish of
its fall, the heavier drip from the eaves, and the swirl and gurgle down
the two steep gutters and through the sewer grating. There was only one
figure in the whole length of Scudamore Lane. It was that of a man, and
it stood outside the door of Dr. Horace Selby.
