The wounded sergeant had not waited long for his vengeance. For some minutes I did not dare to move, for it seemed certain that
someone would be attracted by the noise. However, all was silent save for the chimes striking midnight in the
city. I crept along the branch and lifted myself on to the roof. The
Spaniard's gun was lying there, but it was of no service to me, since he
had the powder-horn at his belt. At the same time, if it were found, it
would warn the enemy that something had happened, so I thought it best
to drop it over the wall.
