      “Do you mean that you don’t know?”       “Come in here, if you please. Just have the kindness to step in
      here.”       He led the way into his bedroom, which was large and comfortably
      furnished.       “You see that,” said he, pointing to a big black box at the end
      of his bed. “I have never been a very rich man, Mr. Holmes—never
      made but one investment in my life, as Dr. Trevelyan would tell
      you. But I don’t believe in bankers. I would never trust a
      banker, Mr. Holmes. Between ourselves, what little I have is in
      that box, so you can understand what it means to me when unknown
      people force themselves into my rooms.”
