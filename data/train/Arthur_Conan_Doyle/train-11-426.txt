They walked slowly in square, their colours waving over the sombre line
of the bearskins. All round them raged the English cavalry and the black
Lancers of Brunswick, wave after wave thundering up, breaking with a
crash, and recoiling in ruin. When last I saw them, the English guns,
six at a time, were smashing grape-shot through their ranks and the
English infantry were closing in upon three sides and pouring volleys
into them; but still, like a noble lion with fierce hounds clinging to
its flanks, the glorious remnant of the Guard, marching slowly, halting,
closing up, dressing, moved majestically from their last battle. Behind
them the Guard's battery of twelve-pounders was drawn up upon the ridge.
Every gunner was in his place, but no gun fired. “Why do you not fire?”
 I asked the colonel as I passed. “Our powder is finished.” “Then why not
retire?” “Our appearance may hold them back for a little. We must give
the Emperor time to escape.” Such were the soldiers of France.
