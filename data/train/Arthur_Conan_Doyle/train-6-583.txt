“Indeed, you may well say so, Master Loring. He is the bravest knight
in England, and in Christendom also, as I believe. No man hath done such
deeds of valor.” Nigel looked at his new acquaintance with hope in his eyes. “You speak
as it becomes you to speak when you uphold your own master,” said he.
“For the same reason, Master Delves, and in no spirit of ill-will to
you, it behooves me to tell you that he is not to be compared in name
or fame with the noble knight on whom I wait. Should you hold otherwise,
then surely we can debate the matter in whatever way or time may please
you best.”
