"Hullo!" said he; "perhaps you are Gregory Brewster?" "My name, sir," answered the veteran. "You are the same Brewster, as I understand, who is on the roll of the
Scots Guards as having been present at the battle of Waterloo?" "I am that man, sir, though we called it the Third Guards in those
days.  It was a fine ridgment, and they only need me to make up a full
muster." "Tut, tut! they'll have to wait years for that," said the gentleman
heartily.  "But I am the colonel of the Scots Guards, and I thought I
would like to have a word with you."
