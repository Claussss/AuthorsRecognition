“Sir,” said I, “I meant no harm by coming here, and I do not know how I
have deserved this extraordinary outburst. Allow me to observe, however,
that you are still covering me with your pistol, and that, as your hand
is rather tremulous, it is more than possible that it may go off. If
you don't turn the muzzle down I shall be compelled in self-defence to
strike you over the wrist with my stick.” “What the deuce brought you here, then?” he asked, in a more composed
voice, putting his weapon back into his bosom. “Can't a gentleman live
quietly without your coming to peep and pry? Have you no business
of your own to look after, eh? And my daughter? how came you to know
anything of her? and what have you been trying to squeeze out of her? It
wasn't chance that brought you here.”
