It was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and ran
thus:     “DEAR MR. HOLMES,—I am very anxious to consult you as to whether I
    should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to
    me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I do
    not inconvenience you. Yours faithfully, 
    “VIOLET HUNTER.” 
“Do you know the young lady?” I asked. “It is half-past ten now.”
