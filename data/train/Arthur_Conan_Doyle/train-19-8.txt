Any one less like my idea of a West Indian could not be imagined.  She
was a small, frail creature, well over forty, I should say, with a
pale, peaky face, and hair of a very light shade of chestnut.  Her
presence was insignificant and her manner retiring.  In any group of
ten women she would have been the last whom one would have picked out.
Her eyes were perhaps her most remarkable, and also, I am compelled to
say, her least pleasant, feature.  They were gray in color,--gray with
a shade of green,--and their expression struck me as being decidedly
furtive.  I wonder if furtive is the word, or should I have said
fierce?  On second thoughts, feline would have expressed it better.  A
crutch leaning against the wall told me what was painfully evident when
she rose: that one of her legs was crippled.
