“It's vera different frae my last place,” says I, discontented-like. And the words were true enough, for auld Fairmer Scott only gave me a
pund a month and parritch twice a day. “Weel, weel,” says he, “maybe we'll gie ye a rise if ye suit. Meanwhile
here's the han'sel shillin' that Maister McNeil tells me it's the custom
tae give, and I shall expec' tae see ye at Cloomber on Monday.” When the Monday cam roond I walked oot tae Cloomber, and a great muckle
hoose it is, wi' a hunderd windows or mair, and space enough tae hide
awa' half the parish.
