‘In good sooth, yes!’ cried Master Pettigrue heartily. ‘What though he
be clothed in a Joseph’s coat of many colours, and hath strange turns
of speech! No man could have fought more stoutly or shown a bolder front
against the enemies of Israel. Surely the youth hath good in his heart,
and will become a seat of grace and a vessel of the Spirit, though
at present he be entangled in the net of worldly follies and carnal
vanities.’
