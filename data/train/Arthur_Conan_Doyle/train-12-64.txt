CHAPTER IV. FROM CLIME TO CLIME 
The chamber in which the bewildered Robert now found himself was more
luxurious, if less rich, than any which he had yet seen. Low settees of
claret-coloured plush were scattered in orderly disorder over a mossy
Eastern carpet. Deep lounges, reclining sofas, American rocking-chairs,
all were to be had for the choosing. One end of the room was walled by
glass, and appeared to open upon a luxuriant hot-house. At the further
end a double line of gilt rails supported a profusion of the most recent
magazines and periodicals. A rack at each side of the inlaid fireplace
sustained a long line of the pipes of all places and nations--English
cherrywoods, French briars, German china-bowls, carved meerschaums,
scented cedar and myall-wood, with Eastern narghiles, Turkish
chibooques, and two great golden-topped hookahs. To right and left
were a series of small lockers, extending in a treble row for the whole
length of the room, with the names of the various brands of tobacco
scrolled in ivory work across them. Above were other larger tiers of
polished oak, which held cigars and cigarettes.
