      “We can follow him to-morrow.”       “Can we? It is not so easy as you seem to think. You are not
      familiar with Cambridgeshire scenery, are you? It does not lend
      itself to concealment. All this country that I passed over
      to-night is as flat and clean as the palm of your hand, and the
      man we are following is no fool, as he very clearly showed
      to-night. I have wired to Overton to let us know any fresh London
      developments at this address, and in the meantime we can only
      concentrate our attention upon Dr. Armstrong, whose name the
      obliging young lady at the office allowed me to read upon the
      counterfoil of Staunton’s urgent message. He knows where the
      young man is—to that I’ll swear, and if he knows, then it must be
      our own fault if we cannot manage to know also. At present it
      must be admitted that the odd trick is in his possession, and, as
      you are aware, Watson, it is not my habit to leave the game in
      that condition.”
