     "The lecturer approached the audience in no spirit of impatient
     dogmatism, but in the capacity of an understanding mind seeking to
     illumine the darkness of doubt in those who had not shared his
     great experiences. He did not dictate, but reasoned and pleaded,
     taking the people into his confidence with strong conviction and a
     consoling faith. 'I want to speak to you to-night on a subject
     which concerns the destiny of every man and woman in this room,'
     began Sir Arthur, bringing everybody at once into an intimate
     personal circle. 'No doubt the Almighty, by putting an angel in
     King William Street, could convert every one of you to
     Spiritualism, but the Almighty law is that we must use our own
     brains, and find out our own salvation, and it is not made too easy
     for us.'"
