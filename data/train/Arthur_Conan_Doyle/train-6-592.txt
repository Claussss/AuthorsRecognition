With a flush upon his olive cheeks and with pride smoldering in his dark
eyes, he looked round him at the eager faces of the men who had been his
comrades from Sluys and Cadsand to Crecy and Calais. They caught fire
from that warlike gleam in his masterful gaze, and a sudden wild, fierce
shout pealed up to the vaulted ceiling, a soldierly thanks for what was
passed and a promise for what was to come. The King's teeth gleamed in a
quick smile, and his large white hand played with the jeweled dagger in
his belt.
