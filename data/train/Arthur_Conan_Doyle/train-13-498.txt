      “But what had it to do with the crime?”       “That, also, is still obscure. But we have learned a good deal,
      you perceive. We know that a man stood in the road looking at the
      quarrel between the Barclays—the blinds were up and the room
      lighted. We know, also, that he ran across the lawn, entered the
      room, accompanied by a strange animal, and that he either struck
      the Colonel or, as is equally possible, that the Colonel fell
      down from sheer fright at the sight of him, and cut his head on
      the corner of the fender. Finally, we have the curious fact that
      the intruder carried away the key with him when he left.”
