      “Now there is one thing that I want to impress upon you before I
      go any further, Mr. Holmes. Effie loves me. Don’t let there be
      any mistake about that. She loves me with her whole heart and
      soul, and never more than now. I know it. I feel it. I don’t want
      to argue about that. A man can tell easily enough when a woman
      loves him. But there’s this secret between us, and we can never
      be the same until it is cleared.”
