“I beg your pardon, Captain Fourneau,” said he. “But do you know what course the man at the wheel is steering?” “Due south,” the captain answered, with his eyes fixed upon his cards. “And he should be steering due east.” “How do you make that out?” The mate gave an angry growl. “I may not have much education,” said he, “but let me tell you this,
Captain Fourneau, I've sailed these waters since I was a little nipper
of ten, and I know the line when I'm on it, and I know the doldrums, and
I know how to find my way to the oil rivers. We are south of the line
now, and we should be steering due east instead of due south if your
port is the port that the owners sent you to.”
