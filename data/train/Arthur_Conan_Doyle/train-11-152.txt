But where was I to hide? It was a vineyard in which I found myself, the
poles of the vines still standing, but the plants gone. There was no
cover there. Besides, I should want some food and water before another
night had come. I hurried wildly onward through the waning darkness,
trusting that chance would be my friend. And I was not disappointed. Chance is a woman, my friends, and she has
her eye always upon a gallant Hussar.
