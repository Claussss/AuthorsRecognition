CHAPTER XXIV. HOW A CHAMPION CAME FORTH FROM THE EAST. 
The Bordeaux lists were, as has already been explained, situated
upon the plain near the river upon those great occasions when the
tilting-ground in front of the Abbey of St. Andrew's was deemed to be
too small to contain the crowd. On the eastern side of this plain the
country-side sloped upwards, thick with vines in summer, but now ridged
with the brown bare enclosures. Over the gently rising plain curved the
white road which leads inland, usually flecked with travellers, but now
with scarce a living form upon it, so completely had the lists drained
all the district of its inhabitants. Strange it was to see such a vast
concourse of people, and then to look upon that broad, white, empty
highway which wound away, bleak and deserted, until it narrowed itself
to a bare streak against the distant uplands.
