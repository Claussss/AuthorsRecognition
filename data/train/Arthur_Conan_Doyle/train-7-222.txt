“I certainly think that it would be much better if Monsieur Fardet would
undertake it,” said Mrs. Belmont, with decision, and so the matter was
arranged. The sun was now high, and it shone with dazzling brightness upon the
bleached bones which lay upon the road. Again the torture of thirst
fell upon the little group of survivors, and again, as they rode
with withered tongues and crusted lips, a vision of the saloon of the
_Korosko_ danced like a mirage before their eyes, and they saw the white
napery, the wine-cards by the places, the long necks of the bottles,
the siphons upon the sideboard. Sadie, who had borne up so well, became
suddenly hysterical, and her shrieks of senseless laughter jarred
horribly upon their nerves. Her aunt on one side of her and Mr. Stephens
on the other did all they could to soothe her, and at last the weary,
over-strung girl relapsed into something between a sleep and a faint,
hanging limp over her pommel, and only kept from falling by the friends
who clustered round her. The baggage-camels were as weary as their
riders, and again and again they had to jerk at their nose-ropes to
prevent them from lying down. From horizon to horizon stretched that one
hugh arch of speckless blue, and up its monstrous concavity crept the
inexorable sun, like some splendid but barbarous deity, who claimed a
tribute of human suffering as his immemorial right.
