Sherlock Holmes put the sopping bundle upon the table beside the lamp
and undid the cord which bound it. From within he extracted a dumb-bell,
which he tossed down to its fellow in the corner. Next he drew forth a
pair of boots. “American, as you perceive,” he remarked, pointing to
the toes. Then he laid upon the table a long, deadly, sheathed knife.
Finally he unravelled a bundle of clothing, comprising a complete set of
underclothes, socks, a gray tweed suit, and a short yellow overcoat.
