And then came their lawsuit with Waverley Abbey, and the Cistercians
laid claim to their richest land, with peccary, turbary and feudal
rights over the remainder. It lingered on for years, this great lawsuit,
and when it was finished the men of the Church and the men of the Law
had divided all that was richest of the estate between them. There was
still left the old manor-house from which with each generation there
came a soldier to uphold the credit of the name and to show the five
scarlet roses on the silver shield where it had always been shown--in
the van. There were twelve bronzes in the little chapel where Matthew
the priest said mass every morning, all of men of the house of Loring.
Two lay with their legs crossed, as being from the Crusades. Six others
rested their feet upon lions, as having died in war. Four only lay with
the effigy of their hounds to show that they had passed in peace.
