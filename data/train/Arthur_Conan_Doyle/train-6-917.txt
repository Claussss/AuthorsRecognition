Let no man think that in these wars England alone was face to face with
France alone. There is glory and to spare without trifling with the
truth. Two Provinces in France, both rich and warlike, had become
English through a royal marriage, and these, Guienne and Gascony,
furnished many of the most valiant soldiers under the island flag.
So poor a country as England could not afford to keep a great force
overseas, and so must needs have lost the war with France through want
of power to uphold the struggle. The feudal system enabled an army to be
drawn rapidly together with small expense, but at the end of a few weeks
it dispersed again as swiftly, and only by a well-filled money-chest
could it be held together. There was no such chest in England, and the
King was forever at his wits' end how to keep his men in the field.
