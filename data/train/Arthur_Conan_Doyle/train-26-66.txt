But to revert to Gibbon: the next stage is the flight of Empire from
Rome to Byzantium, even as the Anglo-Celtic power might find its
centre some day not in London but in Chicago or Toronto. There is
the whole strange story of the tidal wave of Mahommedanism from the
south, submerging all North Africa, spreading right and left to
India on the one side and to Spain on the other, finally washing
right over the walls of Byzantium until it, the bulwark of
Christianity, became what it is now, the advanced European fortress
of the Moslem. Such is the tremendous narrative covering half the
world's known history, which can all be acquired and made part of
yourself by the aid of that humble atlas, pencil, and note-book
already recommended.
