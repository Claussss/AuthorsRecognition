Through this I had a view of the house and of part of the lawn in front
of it, and, though I could see no signs of life outside or at any of the
windows, I settled down with the intention of sticking to my post until
I had a chance of speaking to one or other of the inmates. Indeed, the
cold, dead aspect of the house had struck such a chill into my heart
that I determined to scale the fence at whatever risk of incurring
the general's displeasure rather than return without news of the
Heatherstones.
