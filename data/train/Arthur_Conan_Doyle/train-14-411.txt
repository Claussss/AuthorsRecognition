      Sir Henry opened his eyes. “How was that?”       “This poor wretch was dressed in your clothes. I fear your
      servant who gave them to him may get into trouble with the
      police.”       “That is unlikely. There was no mark on any of them, as far as I
      know.”       “That’s lucky for him—in fact, it’s lucky for all of you, since
      you are all on the wrong side of the law in this matter. I am not
      sure that as a conscientious detective my first duty is not to
      arrest the whole household. Watson’s reports are most
      incriminating documents.”
