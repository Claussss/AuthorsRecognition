My father and I could not help laughing at the rough sailor's very
unorthodox way of proclaiming his orthodoxy. The mate, however, was
evidently in deadly earnest, and proceeded to state his case, marking
off the different points upon the rough, red fingers of his left hand. “It was at Kurrachee, directly after they come that I warned ye,” he
said reproachfully to the captain. “There was three Buddhist Lascars in
my watch, and what did they do when them chaps come aboard? Why, they
down on their stomachs and rubbed their noses on the deck--that's what
they did. They wouldn't ha' done as much for an admiral of the R'yal
Navy. They know who's who--these niggers do; and I smelt mischief
the moment I saw them on their faces. I asked them afterwards in your
presence, Captain, why they had done it, and they answered that the
passengers were holy men. You heard 'em yourself.”
