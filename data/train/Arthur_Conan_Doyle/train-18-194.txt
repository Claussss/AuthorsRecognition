“They do not appear to derive much benefit from this peculiarity in
their organisation,” I remarked incredulously. “Merely the benefit of superior knowledge,” the general answered. “If
you were to go to India, probably the very first thing you would see in
the way of amusement would be a native doing what is called the mango
trick. Of course you have heard or read of it. The fellow plants a mango
seed, and makes passes over it until it sprouts and bears leaves and
fruit--all in the space of half-an-hour. It is not really a trick--it
is a power. These men know more than your Tyndalls or Huxleys do about
Nature's processes, and they can accelerate or retard her workings
by subtle means of which we have no conception. These low-caste
conjurers--as they are called--are mere vulgar dabblers, but the men who
have trod the higher path are as far superior to us in knowledge as we
are to the Hottentots or Patagonians.”
