The Frenchman shrugged his shoulders. He had no belief in survival after
death, but he envied the two Catholics the quiet way in which they took
things for granted. He chuckled to think of what his friends in the Caf√©
Cubat would say if they learned that he had laid down his life for the
Christian faith. Sometimes it amused and sometimes it maddened him, and
he rode onwards with alternate gusts of laughter and of fury, nursing
his wounded wrist all the time like a mother with a sick baby.
