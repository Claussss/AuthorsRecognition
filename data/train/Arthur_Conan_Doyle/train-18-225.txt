At nine o'clock a sharp breeze was blowing, at ten it had freshened into
a gale, and before midnight the most furious storm was raging which I
can remember upon that weather-beaten coast. I sat for some time in our small, oak-panelled sitting-room listening to
the screeching and howling of the blast and to the rattle of the gravel
and pebbles as they pattered against the window. Nature's grim orchestra
was playing its world-old piece with a compass which ranged from
the deep diapason of the thundering surge to the thin shriek of the
scattered shingle and the keen piping of frightened sea birds.
