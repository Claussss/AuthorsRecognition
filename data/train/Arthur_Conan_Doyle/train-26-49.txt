  "His person was large, robust, I may say approaching to the
  gigantic, and grown unwieldy from corpulency. His countenance
  was naturally of the cast of an ancient statue, but somewhat
  disfigured by the scars of King's evil. He was now in his
  sixty-fourth year and was become a little dull of hearing. His
  sight had always been somewhat weak, yet so much does mind
  govern and even supply the deficiencies of organs that his
  perceptions were uncommonly quick and accurate. His head, and
  sometimes also his body, shook with a kind of motion like
  the effect of palsy. He appeared to be frequently disturbed
  by cramps or convulsive contractions of the nature of that
  distemper called St. Vitus' dance. He wore a full suit of
  plain brown clothes, with twisted hair buttons of the same
  colour, a large bushy greyish wig, a plain shirt, black worsted
  stockings and silver buckles. Upon this tour when journeying he
  wore boots and a very wide brown cloth great-coat with pockets
  which might almost have held the two volumes of his folio
  dictionary, and he carried in his hand a large English oak
  stick."
