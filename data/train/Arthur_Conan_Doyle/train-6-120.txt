“Our brother sacrist hath done his duty in urging this suit,” said he,
“for the worldly wealth of this Abbey is placed in his pious keeping,
and it is to him that we should look if we suffered in such ways, for we
are but the trustees of those who come after us. But to my keeping has
been consigned that which is more precious still, the inner spirit and
high repute of those who follow the rule of Saint Bernard. Now it has
ever been our endeavor, since first our saintly founder went down into
the valley of Clairvaux and built himself a cell there, that we should
set an example to all men in gentleness and humility. For this reason
it is that we built our houses in lowly places, that we have no tower to
our Abbey churches, and that no finery and no metal, save only iron or
lead, come within our walls. A brother shall eat from a wooden platter,
drink from an iron cup, and light himself from a leaden sconce. Surely
it is not for such an order who await the exaltation which is promised
to the humble, to judge their own case and so acquire the lands of their
neighbor! If our cause be just, as indeed I believe that it is, then it
were better that it be judged at the King's assizes at Guildford, and so
I decree that the case be now dismissed from the Abbey court so that it
can be heard elsewhere.”
