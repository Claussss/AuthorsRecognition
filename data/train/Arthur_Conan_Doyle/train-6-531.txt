“It was because I was in the water, fair sir, and by my hilt! it suits
my stomach better than being on it,” he answered. “When you first set
forth I swam behind you, for I saw that the Frenchman's boat hung by a
rope, and I thought that while you kept him in play I might gain it.
I had reached it when you were driven back, so I hid behind it in the
water and said my prayers as I have not said them for many a day. Then
you came again, and no one had an eye for me, so I clambered into it,
cut the rope, took the oars which I found there and brought her back for
more men.”
