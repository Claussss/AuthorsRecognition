The rescued prisoners, their hunger appeased and their clothes restored,
led the search for booty. Nigel, leaning on his sword by the gateway,
saw Aylward totter past, a huge bundle under each arm, another slung
over his back and a smaller packet hanging from his mouth. He dropped it
for a moment as he passed his young master. “By these ten finger-bones! I am right glad that I came to the war, and
no man could ask for a more goodly life,” said he. “I have a present
here for every girl in Tilford, and my father need never fear the frown
of the sacrist of Waverley again. But how of you, Squire Loring? It
standeth not aright that we should gather the harvest whilst you, who
sowed it, go forth empty-handed. Come, gentle sir, take these things
that I have gathered, and I will go back and find more.”
