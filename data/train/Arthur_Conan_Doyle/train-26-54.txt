And then his prejudices! Most of us have some unreasoning aversion.
In our more generous moments we are not proud of it. But consider
those of Johnson! When they were all eliminated there was not so
very much left. He hated Whigs. He disliked Scotsmen. He detested
Nonconformists (a young lady who joined them was "an odious wench").
He loathed Americans. So he walked his narrow line, belching fire
and fury at everything to the right or the left of it. Macaulay's
posthumous admiration is all very well, but had they met in life
Macaulay would have contrived to unite under one hat nearly
everything that Johnson abominated.
