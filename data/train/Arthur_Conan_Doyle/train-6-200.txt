“I will guard them,” cried the lady. “Pommers is not so easily held. Do you bide here, Aylward, until you
hear from me. Stir not, I command you!” So saying, Nigel, with the
light, of adventure gleaming in his joyous eyes, drew his sword and
plunged swiftly into the forest. Far and fast he ran, from glade to glade, breaking through the bushes,
springing over the brambles, light as a young deer, peering this way and
that, straining his ears for a sound, and catching only the cry of the
wood-pigeons. Still on he went, with the constant thought of the weeping
woman behind and of the captured man in front. It was not until he was
footsore and out of breath that he stopped with his hand to his side,
and considered that his own business had still to be done, and that it
was time once more that he should seek the road to Guildford.
