There's the cast of a medal on the top of that cabinet which will
bring it all close home to you. It is taken from the die of the
medal which Napoleon had arranged to issue on the day that he
reached London. It serves, at any rate, to show that his great
muster was not a bluff, but that he really did mean serious
business. On one side is his head. On the other France is engaged
in strangling and throwing to earth a curious fish-tailed creature,
which stands for perfidious Albion. "Frappe a Londres" is
printed on one part of it, and "La Descente dans Angleterre" upon
another. Struck to commemorate a conquest, it remains now as a
souvenir of a fiasco. But it was a close call.
