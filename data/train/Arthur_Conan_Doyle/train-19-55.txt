We had an interesting evening.  Mrs. Wilson was present during most of
the time, which prevented the embarrassment which one at least of us
must have felt.  Miss Penclosa's manner was quite the same as usual,
and she expressed no surprise at my having come in spite of my note.
There was nothing in her bearing to show that yesterday's incident had
made any impression upon her, and so I am inclined to hope that I
overrated it.
