I have reason to believe that many people, even among those who knew
India well, thought that Sir Edward was romancing, and that he had
evolved his incidents from his imagination. The few faded sheets which
I send you will show you that this is not the case, and that our men of
science must recognise powers and laws which can and have been used by
man, but which are unknown to European civilisation.
