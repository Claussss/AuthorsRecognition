“Perhaps, fair son,” said he, “you are like so many other lads who ride
to the wars, and know so much already that it is waste of breath to
advise them?” “Nay, my fair lord, I know nothing save that I would fain do my duty and
either win honorable advancement or die worshipful on the field.” “You are wise to be humble,” said Chandos; “for indeed he who knows most
of war knows best that there is much to learn. As there is a mystery
of the rivers and a mystery of woodcraft, even so there is a mystery
of warfare by which battles may be lost and gained; for all nations are
brave, and where the brave meets the brave it is he who is crafty and
war-wise who will win the day. The best hound will run at fault if he be
ill laid on, and the best hawk will fly at check if he be badly loosed,
and even so the bravest army may go awry if it be ill handled. There are
not in Christendom better knights and squires than those of the French,
and yet we have had the better of them, for in our Scottish Wars and
elsewhere we have learned more of this same mystery of which I speak.”
