I dwell upon this particular book because it is the best; but take
the whole line, and there is not one which is not full of interest.
Marbot gives you the point of view of the officer. So does De
Segur and De Fezensac and Colonel Gonville, each in some different
branch of the service. But some are from the pens of the men in the
ranks, and they are even more graphic than the others. Here, for
example, are the papers of good old Cogniet, who was a grenadier of
the Guard, and could neither read nor write until after the great
wars were over. A tougher soldier never went into battle. Here is
Sergeant Bourgogne, also with his dreadful account of that nightmare
campaign in Russia, and the gallant Chevillet, trumpeter of
Chasseurs, with his matter-of-fact account of all that he saw, where
the daily "combat" is sandwiched in betwixt the real business of the
day, which was foraging for his frugal breakfast and supper. There
is no better writing, and no easier reading, than the records of
these men of action.
