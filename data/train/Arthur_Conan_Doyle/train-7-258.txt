The Frenchman stepped forward, and raising his hand he took a
large, shining date out of the Moolah's beard. This he swallowed and
immediately produced once more from his left elbow. He had often
given his little conjuring entertainment on board the boat, and his
fellow-passengers had had some good-natured laughter at his expense,
for he was not quite skilful enough to deceive the critical European
intelligence. But now it looked as if this piece of obvious palming
might be the point upon which all their fates would hang. A deep hum of
surprise rose from the ring of Arabs, and deepened as the Frenchman drew
another date from the nostril of a camel and tossed it into the air,
from which, apparently, it never descended. That gaping sleeve was
obvious enough to his companions, but the dim light was all in favour
of the performer. So delighted and interested was the audience that they
paid little heed to a mounted camel-man who trotted swiftly between the
palm trunks. All might have been well had not Fardet, carried away by
his own success, tried to repeat his trick once more, with the result
that the date fell out of his palm and the deception stood revealed.
In vain he tried to pass on at once to another of his little stock. The
Moolah said something, and an Arab struck Fardet across the shoulders
with the thick shaft of his spear.
