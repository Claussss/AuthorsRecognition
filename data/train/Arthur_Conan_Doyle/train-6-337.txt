Sir John after his return from Scotland had become the King's own head
huntsman, famous through all England for his knowledge of venery, until
at last, getting overheavy for his horses, he had settled in modest
comfort into the old house of Cosford upon the eastern slope of the
Hindhead hill. Here, as his face grew redder and his beard more white,
he spent the evening of his days, amid hawks and hounds, a flagon of
spiced wine ever at his elbow, and his swollen foot perched upon a stool
before him. There it was that many an old comrade broke his journey as
he passed down the rude road which led from London to Portsmouth, and
thither also came the young gallants of the country to hear the stout
knight's tales of old wars, or to learn, from him that lore of the
forest and the chase which none could teach so well as he.
