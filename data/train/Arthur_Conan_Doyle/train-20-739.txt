      Yours faithfully,
      LESLIE ARMSTRONG.       “An outspoken, honest antagonist is the doctor,” said Holmes.
      “Well, well, he excites my curiosity, and I must really know
      before I leave him.”       “His carriage is at his door now,” said I. “There he is stepping
      into it. I saw him glance up at our window as he did so. Suppose
      I try my luck upon the bicycle?”       “No, no, my dear Watson! With all respect for your natural
      acumen, I do not think that you are quite a match for the worthy
      doctor. I think that possibly I can attain our end by some
      independent explorations of my own. I am afraid that I must leave
      you to your own devices, as the appearance of _two_ inquiring
      strangers upon a sleepy countryside might excite more gossip than
      I care for. No doubt you will find some sights to amuse you in
      this venerable city, and I hope to bring back a more favourable
      report to you before evening.”
