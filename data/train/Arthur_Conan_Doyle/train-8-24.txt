"Highly honoured, sir, I am sure." "You appear to have been very prompt and businesslike in all that you
have done.  Was there any clue, may I ask, as to the exact hour that
the man met his death?" "He had been there since one o'clock.  There was rain about that time,
and his death had certainly been before the rain." "But that is perfectly impossible, Mr. Baynes," cried our client. "His
voice is unmistakable.  I could swear to it that it was he who
addressed me in my bedroom at that very hour."
