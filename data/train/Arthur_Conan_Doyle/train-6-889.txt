But Nigel was not long unavenged. The huge iron club of Belford struck
the dwarf Raguenel to the ground, while Belford in turn was felled by a
sweeping blow from Beaumanoir. Sometimes a dozen were on the ground at
one time, but so strong was the armor, and so deftly was the force of a
blow broken by guard and shield, that the stricken men were often pulled
to their feet once more by their comrades, and were able to continue the
fight.
