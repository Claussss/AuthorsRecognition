It was rather a fiasco and for years we didn't talk more about it than
we could help, but it's no secret now and I thought you might like to
jot down the facts in your case-book. 
THE DOCTORS OF HOYLAND. Dr. James Ripley was always looked upon as an exceedingly lucky dog by
all of the profession who knew him.  His father had preceded him in a
practice in the village of Hoyland, in the north of Hampshire, and all
was ready for him on the very first day that the law allowed him to put
his name at the foot of a prescription.  In a few years the old
gentleman retired, and settled on the South Coast, leaving his son in
undisputed possession of the whole country side.  Save for Dr. Horton,
near Basingstoke, the young surgeon had a clear run of six miles in
every direction, and took his fifteen hundred pounds a year, though, as
is usual in country practices, the stable swallowed up most of what the
consulting-room earned.
