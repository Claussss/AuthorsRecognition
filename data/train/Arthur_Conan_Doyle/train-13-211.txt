      It was a cosey, well-furnished apartment, with two candles
      burning upon the table and two upon the mantelpiece. In the
      corner, stooping over a desk, there sat what appeared to be a
      little girl. Her face was turned away as we entered, but we could
      see that she was dressed in a red frock, and that she had long
      white gloves on. As she whisked round to us, I gave a cry of
      surprise and horror. The face which she turned towards us was of
      the strangest livid tint, and the features were absolutely devoid
      of any expression. An instant later the mystery was explained.
      Holmes, with a laugh, passed his hand behind the childâ€™s ear, a
      mask peeled off from her countenance, and there was a little coal
      black negress, with all her white teeth flashing in amusement at
      our amazed faces. I burst out laughing, out of sympathy with her
      merriment; but Grant Munro stood staring, with his hand clutching
      his throat.
