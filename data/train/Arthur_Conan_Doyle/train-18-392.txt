Here was an opportunity of striking terror into the tribes. Leaving
Chamberlain and Elliott to continue the pursuit of the main body, I
wheeled my Sepoys into the narrow path and proceeded slowly down it in
extended order, covering the whole ground from cliff to cliff. Not a
jackal could have passed us unseen. The rebels were caught like rats in
a trap. The defile in which we found ourselves was the most gloomy and majestic
that I have ever seen. On either side naked precipices rose sheer up
for a thousand feet or more, converging upon each other so as to leave a
very narrow slit of daylight above us, which was further reduced by the
feathery fringe of palm trees and aloes which hung over each lip of the
chasm.
