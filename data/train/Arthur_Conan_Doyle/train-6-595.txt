A dozen hands went up into the air; but the King turned to the Earl of
Suffolk at his elbow. “You have fought them, Thomas?” said he. “Yes, sire, I was in the great sea-fight eight years ago at the Island
of Guernsey, when Lord Lewis of Spain held the sea against the Earl of
Pembroke.” “How found you them, Thomas?” “Very excellent people, sire, and no man could ask for better. On every
ship they have a hundred crossbowmen of Genoa, the best in the world,
and their spearmen also are very hardy men. They would throw great
cantles of iron from the tops of the masts, and many of our people met
their death through it. If we can bar their way in the Narrow Sea, then
there will be much hope of honor for all of us.”
