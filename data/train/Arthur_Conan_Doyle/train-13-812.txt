      When I was near the bottom of the descent I looked back. It was
      impossible, from that position, to see the fall, but I could see
      the curving path which winds over the shoulder of the hill and
      leads to it. Along this a man was, I remember, walking very
      rapidly.       I could see his black figure clearly outlined against the green
      behind him. I noted him, and the energy with which he walked but
      he passed from my mind again as I hurried on upon my errand.
