it was sure that the third would get him. From Chicago he went under a
changed name to California, and it was there that the light went for a
time out of his life when Ettie Edwards died. Once again he was nearly
killed, and once again under the name of Douglas he worked in a lonely
canyon, where with an English partner named Barker he amassed a fortune.
At last there came a warning to him that the bloodhounds were on his
track once more, and he cleared--only just in time--for England. And

mate, and lived for five years as a Sussex county gentleman, a life
which ended with the strange happenings of which we have heard.
