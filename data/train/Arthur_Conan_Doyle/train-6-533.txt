“That we shall soon find out,” said Badding. “Come with me and we will
search the ship from truck to keel ere he escapes us.” There was a scuttle at the base of the mast which led down into the body
of the vessel, and the Englishmen were approaching this when a strange
sight brought them to a stand. A round brazen head had appeared in the
square dark opening. An instant afterward a pair of shining shoulders
followed. Then slowly the whole figure of a man in complete plate-armor
emerged on the deck. In his gauntleted hand he carried a heavy steel
mace. With this uplifted he moved toward his enemies, silent save for
the ponderous clank of his footfall. It was an inhuman, machine-like
figure, menacing and terrible, devoid of all expression, slow-moving,
inexorable and awesome.
