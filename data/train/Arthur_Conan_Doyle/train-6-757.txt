“As long as I hold the King's order I shall be master, and by the Lord I
will hang you, James, on a near tree if I have further cause of offense!
How now, Nigel? I see by yonder white horse that you at least have not
failed me. I will speak with you anon. Percy, bring up your men, and let
us gather round this castle, for, as I hope for my soul's salvation, I
win not leave it until I have my archers, or the head of him who holds
them.”
