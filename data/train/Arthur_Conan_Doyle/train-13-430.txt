      “It _does_ give a clue. Whoever wrote that note was the man who
      brought William Kirwan out of his bed at that hour. But where is
      the rest of that sheet of paper?”       “I examined the ground carefully in the hope of finding it,” said
      the Inspector.       “It was torn out of the dead man’s hand. Why was some one so
      anxious to get possession of it? Because it incriminated him. And
      what would he do with it? Thrust it into his pocket, most likely,
      never noticing that a corner of it had been left in the grip of
      the corpse. If we could get the rest of that sheet it is obvious
      that we should have gone a long way towards solving the mystery.”
