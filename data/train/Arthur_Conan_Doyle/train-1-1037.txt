On Lord Methuen himself no blame can rest for this unsuccessful action.
If the workman's tool snaps in his hand he cannot be held responsible
for the failure of his task. The troops who misbehaved were none of his
training. 'If you hear anyone slang him,' says one of his men, 'you are
to tell them that he is the finest General and the truest gentleman that
ever fought in this war.' Such was the tone of his own troopers, and
such also that of the spokesmen of the nation when they commented upon
the disaster in the Houses of Parliament. It was a fine example of
British justice and sense of fair play, even in that bitter moment, that
to hear his eulogy one would have thought that the occasion had been one
when thanks were being returned for a victory. It is a generous public
with fine instincts, and Paul Methuen, wounded and broken, still
remained in their eyes the heroic soldier and the chivalrous man of
honour.
