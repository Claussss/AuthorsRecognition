The nearest lifeboat was in the Bay of Luce, ten long miles away, but
here was our own broad, roomy craft upon the shingle, and plenty of
brave fisher lads to form a crew. Six of us sprang to the oars, the
others pushed us off, and we fought our way through the swirling, raging
waters, staggering and recoiling before the great, sweeping billows, but
still steadily decreasing the distance between the barque and ourselves.
