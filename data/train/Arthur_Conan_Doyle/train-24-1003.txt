As he spoke, the vast throng of Spaniards and of Frenchmen trooped
across the plain, with brandished arms and tossing banners. All day long
the sound of revelry and of rejoicing from the crowded camp swelled up
to the ears of the Englishmen, and they could see the soldiers of the
two nations throwing themselves into each other's arms and dancing
hand-in-hand round the blazing fires. The sun had sunk behind a
cloud-bank in the west before Sir Nigel at last gave word that the men
should resume their arms and have their horses ready. He had himself
thrown off his armor, and had dressed himself from head to foot in the
harness of the captured Spaniard.
