      A cab had driven up whilst the American had been talking. Two
      uniformed policemen sat inside. Inspector Martin rose and touched
      his prisoner on the shoulder.       “It is time for us to go.”       “Can I see her first?”       “No, she is not conscious. Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I only hope that
      if ever again I have an important case, I shall have the good
      fortune to have you by my side.”
