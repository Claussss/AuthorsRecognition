“Nay, my fair lord,” said Alleyne, “these are not horses and a squire,
but mules and a varlet. The man is a mercer, for he hath a great bundle
beside him.” “Now, God's blessing on your honest English voice!” cried the stranger,
pricking up his ears at the sound of Alleyne's words. “Never have I
heard music that was so sweet to mine ear. Come, Watkin lad, throw the
bales over Laura's back! My heart was nigh broke, for it seemed that I
had left all that was English behind me, and that I would never set eyes
upon Norwich market square again.” He was a tall, lusty, middle-aged
man with a ruddy face, a brown forked beard shot with gray, and a
broad Flanders hat set at the back of his head. His servant, as tall as
himself, but gaunt and raw-boned, had swung the bales on the back of
one mule, while the merchant mounted upon the other and rode to join
the party. It was easy to see, as he approached, from the quality of
his dress and the richness of his trappings, that he was a man of some
wealth and position.
