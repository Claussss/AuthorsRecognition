Had two of these ropes settled upon the horse, and had their throwers
found some purchase of stump or boulder by which they could hold them,
then the man's brain might have won its wonted victory over swiftness
and strength. But the brains were themselves at fault which imagined
that one such rope would serve any purpose save to endanger the thrower. Yet so it was, and what might have been foreseen occurred at the very
moment of the arrival of the monks. The horse, having chased one of his
enemies to the wall, remained so long snorting his contempt over the
coping that the others were able to creep upon him from behind. Several
ropes were flung, and one noose settled over the proud crest and lost
itself in the waving mane. In an instant the creature had turned and the
men were flying for their lives; but he who had cast the rope lingered,
uncertain what use to make of his own success. That moment of doubt was
fatal. With a yell of dismay, the man saw the great creature rear above
him. Then with a crash the fore feet fell upon him and dashed him to
the ground. He rose screaming, was hurled over once more, and lay a
quivering, bleeding heap, while the savage horse, the most cruel and
terrible in its anger of all creatures on earth, bit and shook and
trampled the writhing body.
