A great carack was within a bowshot of them and crossing their bows.
Bunce looked up at his mast, and he saw that already it was shaken and
drooping. Another blow and it would be over the side and his ship a
helpless log upon the water. He jammed his helm round therefore, and ran
his ship alongside the Spaniard, throwing out his hooks and iron chains
as he did so. They, no less eager, grappled the Philippa both fore and aft, and the
two vessels, linked tightly together, surged slowly over the long blue
rollers. Over their bulwarks hung a cloud of men locked together in
a desperate struggle, sometimes surging forward on to the deck of the
Spaniard, sometimes recoiling back on to the King's ship, reeling this
way and that, with the swords flickering like silver flames above them,
while the long-drawn cry of rage and agony swelled up like a wolf's howl
to the calm blue heaven above them.
