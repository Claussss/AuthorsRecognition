Really, when I had read the note, I was too relieved to be angry.  It
was a liberty.  Certainly it was a very great liberty indeed on the
part of a lady whom I had only met once.  But, after all, I had
challenged her by my scepticism.  It may have been, as she said, a
little difficult to devise a test which would satisfy me. And she had done that.  There could be no question at all upon the
point.  For me hypnotic suggestion was finally established.  It took
its place from now onward as one of the facts of life.  That Agatha,
who of all women of my acquaintance has the best balanced mind, had
been reduced to a condition of automatism appeared to be certain.  A
person at a distance had worked her as an engineer on the shore might
guide a Brennan torpedo.  A second soul had stepped in, as it were, had
pushed her own aside, and had seized her nervous mechanism, saying:  "I
will work this for half an hour."  And Agatha must have been
unconscious as she came and as she returned.  Could she make her way in
safety through the streets in such a state?  I put on my hat and
hurried round to see if all was well with her.
