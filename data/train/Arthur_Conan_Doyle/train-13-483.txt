      “Colonel Barclay’s family life appears to have been a uniformly
      happy one. Major Murphy, to whom I owe most of my facts, assures
      me that he has never heard of any misunderstanding between the
      pair. On the whole, he thinks that Barclay’s devotion to his wife
      was greater than his wife’s to Barclay. He was acutely uneasy if
      he were absent from her for a day. She, on the other hand, though
      devoted and faithful, was less obtrusively affectionate. But they
      were regarded in the regiment as the very model of a middle-aged
      couple. There was absolutely nothing in their mutual relations to
      prepare people for the tragedy which was to follow.
