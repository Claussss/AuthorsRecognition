“You have done enough for now, Cecil,” said she. “Whatever comes of it
in the future, you have done enough.” “Enough and more than enough,” remarked Sherlock Holmes gravely. “I have
every sympathy with you, madam, and should strongly urge you to have
some confidence in the common sense of our jurisdiction and to take the
police voluntarily into your complete confidence. It may be that I am
myself at fault for not following up the hint which you conveyed to me
through my friend, Dr. Watson; but, at that time I had every reason to
believe that you were directly concerned in the crime. Now I am
assured that this is not so. At the same time, there is much that is
unexplained, and I should strongly recommend that you ask Mr. Douglas to
tell us his own story.”
