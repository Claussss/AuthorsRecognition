“Upon my word, Watson!” said Holmes at last with an unsteady voice, “I
owe you both my thanks and an apology. It was an unjustifiable
experiment even for one’s self, and doubly so for a friend. I am really
very sorry.” “You know,” I answered with some emotion, for I have never seen so much
of Holmes’s heart before, “that it is my greatest joy and privilege to
help you.” He relapsed at once into the half-humorous, half-cynical vein which was
his habitual attitude to those about him. “It would be superfluous to
drive us mad, my dear Watson,” said he. “A candid observer would
certainly declare that we were so already before we embarked upon so
wild an experiment. I confess that I never imagined that the effect
could be so sudden and so severe.” He dashed into the cottage, and,
reappearing with the burning lamp held at full arm’s length, he threw
it among a bank of brambles. “We must give the room a little time to
clear. I take it, Watson, that you have no longer a shadow of a doubt
as to how these tragedies were produced?”
