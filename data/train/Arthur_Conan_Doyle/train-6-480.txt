Poor Nigel, who had trusted to his lance and to Pommers to break his
path to glory, stood aghast at this list of needs. “Alas!” he cried.
“How am I to gain all this?--I, who could scarce learn to read or write
though the good Father Matthew broke a hazel stick a day across my
shoulders?” “You will gain it, fair son, where others have gained it before you. You
have that which is the first thing of all, a heart of fire from which
other colder hearts may catch a spark. But you must have knowledge
also of that which warfare has taught us in olden times. We know,
par exemple, that horsemen alone cannot hope to win against good
foot-soldiers. Has it not been tried at Courtrai, at Stirling, and
again under my own eyes at Crecy, where the chivalry of France went down
before our bowmen?”
