“The game is afoot, my friends!” said he. “Dress, John! Dress, Walter!
Quick all of you! Squires, bring the harness! Let each tend to himself,
for the time is short.” A strange sight it was to see these forty nobles tearing off their
clothes and littering the deck with velvets and satins, whilst the
squire of each, as busy as an ostler before a race, stooped and pulled
and strained and riveted, fastening the bassinets, the legpieces, the
front and the back plates, until the silken courtier had become the man
of steel. When their work was finished, there stood a stern group of
warriors where the light dandies had sung and jested round Sir John's
guitar. Below in orderly silence the archers were mustering under their
officers and taking their allotted stations. A dozen had swarmed up to
their hazardous post in the little tower in the tops.
