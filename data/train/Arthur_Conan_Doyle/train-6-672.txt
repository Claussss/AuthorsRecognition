That night, two hours after dark, a small boat put forth from the
Basilisk. It contained Simon, Aylward and two seamen. The soldiers
carried their swords, and Black Simon bore a brown biscuit-bag over
his shoulder. Under his direction the rowers skirted the dangerous
surf which beat against the cliffs until they came to a spot where an
outlying reef formed a breakwater. Within was a belt of calm water and a
shallow cover with a sloping beach. Here the boat was dragged up and the
seamen were ordered to wait, while Simon and Aylward started on their
errand.
