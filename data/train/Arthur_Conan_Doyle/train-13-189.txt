      will tell you everything some day, but nothing but misery can

      her off, she clung to me in a frenzy of entreaty.       “‘Trust me, Jack!’ she cried. ‘Trust me only this once. You will
      never have cause to regret it. You know that I would not have a
      secret from you if it were not for your own sake. Our whole lives
      are at stake in this. If you come home with me, all will be well.
      If you force your way into that cottage, all is over between us.’
