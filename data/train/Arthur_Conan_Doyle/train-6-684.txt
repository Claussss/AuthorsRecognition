“Now, Samkin, now!” cried Simon, and jumping out from the hiding-place
he made for the door. It had not yet been fastened. The two comrades
sprang inside. Then Simon drew the bolts so that none might interrupt
them. A long table littered with flagons and beakers lay before them. It was
lit up by a line of torches, which flickered and smoked in their iron
sconces. At the farther end a solitary man was seated. His head rested
upon his two hands, as if he were befuddled with wine, but at the harsh
sound of the snapping bolts he raised his face and looked angrily around
him. It was a strange powerful head, tawny and shaggy like a lion's,
with a tangled beard and a large harsh face, bloated and blotched with
vice. He laughed as the newcomers entered, thinking that two of his boon
companions had returned to finish a flagon. Then he stared hard and he
passed his hand over his eyes like one who thinks he may be dreaming.
