“I suppose, Watson, we must look upon you as a man of letters,” said
he. “How do you define the word ‘grotesque’?” “Strange—remarkable,” I suggested. He shook his head at my definition. “There is surely something more than that,” said he; “some underlying
suggestion of the tragic and the terrible. If you cast your mind back
to some of those narratives with which you have afflicted a
long-suffering public, you will recognise how often the grotesque has
deepened into the criminal. Think of that little affair of the
red-headed men. That was grotesque enough in the outset, and yet it
ended in a desperate attempt at robbery. Or, again, there was that most
grotesque affair of the five orange pips, which led straight to a
murderous conspiracy. The word puts me on the alert.”
