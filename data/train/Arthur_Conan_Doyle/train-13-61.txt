      “He has the horse, then?”       “He tried to bluster out of it, but I described to him so exactly
      what his actions had been upon that morning that he is convinced
      that I was watching him. Of course you observed the peculiarly
      square toes in the impressions, and that his own boots exactly
      corresponded to them. Again, of course no subordinate would have
      dared to do such a thing. I described to him how, when according
      to his custom he was the first down, he perceived a strange horse
      wandering over the moor. How he went out to it, and his
      astonishment at recognising, from the white forehead which has
      given the favourite its name, that chance had put in his power
      the only horse which could beat the one upon which he had put his
      money. Then I described how his first impulse had been to lead
      him back to King’s Pyland, and how the devil had shown him how he
      could hide the horse until the race was over, and how he had led
      it back and concealed it at Mapleton. When I told him every
      detail he gave it up and thought only of saving his own skin.”
