“Maybe we'll see more of you before very long,” said one of the
patrolmen with a grin. “You're a real hand-picked one, if I am a judge.” “I was thinking the same,” remarked the other. “I guess we may meet
again.” “I'm not afraid of you, and don't you think it!” cried McMurdo. “My
name's Jack McMurdo--see? If you want me, you'll find me at Jacob
Shafter's on Sheridan Street, Vermissa; so I'm not hiding from you, am
I? Day or night I dare to look the like of you in the face--don't make
any mistake about that!”
