There is a little vignette of Napoleon's men in captivity. Here is
another which is worth preserving of the bearing of his veterans
when wounded on the field of battle. It is from Mercer's
recollections of the Battle of Waterloo. Mercer had spent the day
firing case into the French cavalry at ranges from fifty to two
hundred yards, losing two-thirds of his own battery in the process.
In the evening he had a look at some of his own grim handiwork.
