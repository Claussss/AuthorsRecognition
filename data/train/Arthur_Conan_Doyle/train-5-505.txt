It was, then, with a feeling of some surprise and considerable
curiosity that on driving through Lower Hoyland one morning he
perceived that the new house at the end of the village was occupied,
and that a virgin brass plate glistened upon the swinging gate which
faced the high road.  He pulled up his fifty guinea chestnut mare and
took a good look at it.  "Verrinder Smith, M. D.," was printed across
it in very neat, small lettering.  The last man had had letters half a
foot long, with a lamp like a fire-station.  Dr. James Ripley noted the
difference, and deduced from it that the new-comer might possibly prove
a more formidable opponent.  He was convinced of it that evening when
he came to consult the current medical directory.  By it he learned
that Dr. Verrinder Smith was the holder of superb degrees, that he had
studied with distinction at Edinburgh, Paris, Berlin, and Vienna, and
finally that he had been awarded a gold medal and the Lee Hopkins
scholarship for original research, in recognition of an exhaustive
inquiry into the functions of the anterior spinal nerve roots.  Dr.
Ripley passed his fingers through his thin hair in bewilderment as he
read his rival's record.  What on earth could so brilliant a man mean
by putting up his plate in a little Hampshire hamlet.
