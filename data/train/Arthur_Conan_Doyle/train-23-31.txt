I do not understand how any man can examine the many instances coming
from various angles of approach without recognising that there really
is a second body of this sort, which incidentally goes far to account
for all stories, sacred or profane, of ghosts, apparitions and visions.
Now, what is this second body, and how does it fit into modern
religious revelation? What it is, is a difficult question, and yet when science and
imagination unite, as Tyndall said they should unite, to throw a
searchlight into the unknown, they may produce a beam sufficient to
outline vaguely what will become clearer with the future advance of our
race.  Science has demonstrated that while ether pervades everything
the ether which is actually in a body is different from the ether
outside it.  "Bound" ether is the name given to this, which Fresnel and
others have shown to be denser.  Now, if this fact be applied to the
human body, the result would be that, if all that is visible of that
body were removed, there would still remain a complete and absolute
mould of the body, formed in bound ether which would be different from
the ether around it.  This argument is more solid than mere
speculation, and it shows that even the soul may come to be defined in
terms of matter and is not altogether "such stuff as dreams are made
of."
