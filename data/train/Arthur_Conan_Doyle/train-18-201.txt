I drove away from the house with the full determination of calling again
upon my interesting patient, and endeavouring to elicit some further
particulars as to his past life and his present circumstances. I was
destined, however, to be disappointed, for I received that very evening
a note from the general himself, enclosing a handsome fee for my single
visit, and informing me that my treatment had done him so much good that
he considered himself to be convalescent, and would not trouble me to
see him again.
