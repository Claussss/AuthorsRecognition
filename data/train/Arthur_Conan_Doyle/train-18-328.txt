At first we had made some pretence--she of knitting and I of
reading--but we soon abandoned the useless deception, and sat uneasily
waiting, starting and glancing at each other with questioning eyes
whenever the faggot crackled in the fire or a rat scampered behind the
wainscot. There was a heavy electrical feeling in the air, which weighed
us down with a foreboding of disaster. I rose and flung the hall door open to admit the fresh breeze of the
night. Ragged clouds swept across the sky, and the moon peeped out at
times between their hurrying fringes, bathing the whole countryside in
its cold, white radiance. From where I stood in the doorway I could see
the edge of the Cloomber wood, though the house itself was only
visible from the rising ground some little distance off. At my sister's
suggestion we walked together, she with her shawl over her head, as far
as the summit of this elevation, and looked out in the direction of the
Hall.
