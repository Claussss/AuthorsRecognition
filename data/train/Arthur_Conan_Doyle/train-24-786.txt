“Pardieu!” said the knight, “this David Micheldene must be one of those
Lollards about whom Father Christopher of the priory had so much to say.

Alleyne. “By St. Paul! I have no great love for them,” quoth Sir Nigel. “I am a
man who am slow to change; and, if you take away from me the faith that
I have been taught, it would be long ere I could learn one to set in its
place. It is but a chip here and a chip there, yet it may bring the tree
down in time. Yet, on the other hand, I cannot but think it shame that a
man should turn God's mercy on and off, as a cellarman doth wine with a
spigot.”
