and the purse and the telegram, intending to have them put in a place of

pills, for I am bound to say that I do not attach any importance to
them.” “Give them here,” said Holmes. “Now, Doctor,” turning to me, “are those
ordinary pills?” They certainly were not. They were of a pearly grey colour, small,
round, and almost transparent against the light. “From their lightness
and transparency, I should imagine that they are soluble in water,” I
remarked.
