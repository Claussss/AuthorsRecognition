event.  There is only one course open to me, and I am determined to
take it." "For Heaven's sake, don't do anything rash!" "Believe me, it would be far more rash to adopt any other course.  I
hope that we won't need to bother you, but it will ease my mind to know
that you have this statement of my motives.  And now I am ready to take
your advice and to go to roost, for I want to be at my best in the
morning."
