Again with a dull thunder of hoofs the horses gallop over the soft
water-meadow. Again with a clash of metal the two riders meet. It is
Nigel now, taken clean in the face of his helmet with the blunted spear,
who flies backward off his horse and falls clanging on the grass. But good heavens! what is this? Manny has thrown up his hands in horror
and the lance has dropped from his nerveless fingers. From all sides,
with cries of dismay, with oaths and shouts and ejaculations to the
saints, the horsemen ride wildly in. Was ever so dreadful, so sudden, so
complete, an end to a gentle passage at arms? Surely their eyes must be
at fault? Some wizard's trick has been played upon them to deceive their
senses. But no, it was only too clear. There on the greensward lay the
trunk of the stricken cavalier, and there, a good dozen yards beyond,
lay his helmeted head.
