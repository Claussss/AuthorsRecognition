“I knew not its power, fair lord.” “By my soul, Nigel, I think that none of us know its power. I can see
the day when all that we delight in, the splendor and glory of war, may
all go down before that which beats through the plate of steel as easily
as the leathern jacket. I have bestrode my warhorse in my armor and have
looked down at the sooty, smoky bombardman beside me, and I have thought
that perhaps I was the last of the old and he the first of the new; that
there would come a time when he and his engines would sweep you and me
and the rest of us from the field.”
