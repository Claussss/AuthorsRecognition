At the sight Boss McGinty gave the roar of a wounded bear and plunged
for the half-opened door. A levelled revolver met him there with the
stern blue eyes of Captain Marvin of the Mine Police gleaming behind the
sights. The Boss recoiled and fell back into his chair. “You're safer there, Councillor,” said the man whom they had known as
McMurdo. “And you, Baldwin, if you don't take your hand off your pistol,
you'll cheat the hangman yet. Pull it out, or by the Lord that made
me--There, that will do. There are forty armed men round this house,
and you can figure it out for yourself what chance you have. Take their
pistols, Marvin!”
