Brother William was deeply shocked. "Of course, if a woman's assurance is of more value than the opinion of
the assistant surgeon of a London hospital, there is nothing more to be

and Dr. William went back to London that evening in a huff. The lady, who had heard of his coming, was much surprised on learning
his departure.
