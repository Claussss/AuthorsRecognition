‘Hast ever slain a man in anger?’ asked Saxon, as we galloped along. ‘Never,’ I answered. ‘Ha! You will find that when you hear the clink of steel against steel,
and see your foeman’s eyes, you will straightway forget all rules,
maxims, and precepts of the fence which your father or others may have
taught you.’ ‘I have learned little of the sort,’ said I. My father did but teach
me to strike an honest downright blow. This sword can shear through a
square inch of iron bar.’
