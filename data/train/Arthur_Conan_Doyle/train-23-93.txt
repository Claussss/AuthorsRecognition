Is it not time, then, for the religious bodies to discourage their own
bigots and sectarians, and to seriously consider, if only for
self-preservation, how they can get into line once more with that
general level of human thought which is now so far in front of them?  I
say that they can do more than get level--they can lead.  But to do so
they must, on the one hand, have the firm courage to cut away from
their own bodies all that dead tissue which is but a disfigurement and
an encumbrance.  They must face difficulties of reason, and adapt
themselves to the demands of the human intelligence which rejects, and
is right in rejecting, much which they offer.  Finally, they must
gather fresh strength by drawing in all the new truth and all the new
power which are afforded by this new wave of inspiration which has been
sent into the world by God, and which the human race, deluded and
bemused by the would-be clever, has received with such perverse and
obstinate incredulity.  When they have done all this, they will find
not only that they are leading the world with an obvious right to the
leadership, but, in addition, that they have come round once more to
the very teaching of that Master whom they have so long misrepresented.
