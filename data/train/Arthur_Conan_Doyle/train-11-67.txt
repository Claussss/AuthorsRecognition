“This noble gentleman--he has taken my place, Lorenzo! He has borne it
for me. He has suffered that I might be saved.” I could sympathise with the struggle which I could see in the Italian's
face. At last he held out his hand to me. “Colonel Gerard,” he said, “you are worthy of a great love. I forgive
you, for if you have wronged me you have made a noble atonement. But I
wonder to see you alive. I left the tribunal before you were judged,
but I understood that no mercy would be shown to any Frenchman since the
destruction of the ornaments of Venice.”
