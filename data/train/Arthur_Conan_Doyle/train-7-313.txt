The last Dervish had clattered down the khor, and now above them on
either cliff they could see the Egyptians--tall, thin, square-shouldered
figures, looking, when outlined against the blue sky, wonderfully
like the warriors in the ancient bas-reliefs. Their camels were in the
background, and they were hurrying to join them. At the same time others
began to ride down from the farther end of the ravine, their dark
faces flushed and their eyes shining with the excitement of victory and
pursuit. A very small Englishman, with a straw-coloured moustache and a
weary manner, was riding at the head of them. He halted his camel beside
the fugitives and saluted the ladies. He wore brown boots and brown
belts with steel buckles, which looked trim and workmanlike against his
kharki uniform.
