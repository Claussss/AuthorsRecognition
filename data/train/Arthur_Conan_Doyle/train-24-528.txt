“See to the brave stalls!” cried Alleyne. “See to the noble armor set
forth, and the costly taffeta--and oh, Ford, see to where the scrivener
sits with the pigments and the ink-horns, and the rolls of sheepskin as
white as the Beaulieu napery! Saw man ever the like before?” “Nay, man, there are finer stalls in Cheapside,” answered Ford, whose
father had taken him to London on occasion of one of the Smithfield
joustings. “I have seen a silversmith's booth there which would serve to
buy either side of this street. But mark these houses, Alleyne, how they
thrust forth upon the top. And see to the coats-of-arms at every window,
and banner or pensil on the roof.”
