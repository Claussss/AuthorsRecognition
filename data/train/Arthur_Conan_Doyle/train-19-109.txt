She met me in the High Street yesterday evening and spoke to me.  It
was as well for her, perhaps, that it was not between the hedges of a
lonely country road.  She asked me with her cold smile whether I had
been chastened yet.  I did not deign to answer her.  "We must try
another turn of the screw;" said she.  Have a care, my lady, have a
care!  I had her at my mercy once.  Perhaps another chance may come.
