Sir Francis Norton had never been remarkable for his powers of
observation, and yet he found himself watching these trifles with the
keenest attention. Even the corrosion of the cork of an acid bottle
caught his eye and he wondered that the doctor did not use glass
stoppers. Tiny scratches where the light glinted off from the table,
little stains upon the leather of the desk, chemical formul√¶ scribbled
upon the labels of some of the phials--nothing was too slight to arrest
his attention. And his sense of hearing was equally alert. The heavy
ticking of the solemn black clock above the fireplace struck quite
painfully upon his ears. Yet, in spite of it, and in spite also of the
thick, old-fashioned, wooden partition walls, he could hear the voices
of men talking in the next room and could even catch scraps of their
conversation. "Second hand was bound to take it." "Why, you drew the
last of them yourself." "How could I play the queen when I knew the ace
was against me?" The phrases came in little spurts, falling back into
the dull murmur of conversation. And then suddenly he heard a creaking
of a door, and a step in the hall, and knew with a tingling mixture of
impatience and horror that the crisis of his life was at hand.
