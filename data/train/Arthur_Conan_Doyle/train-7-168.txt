clutching at the pommel of his saddle. The women began to cry, and the

impotent passion, where brutal injustice and ill-usage have to go
without check or even remonstrance. Belmont gripped at his hip-pocket
for his little revolver, and then remembered that he had already given
it to Miss Adams. If his hot hand had clutched it, it would have meant
the death of the Emir and the massacre of the party.
