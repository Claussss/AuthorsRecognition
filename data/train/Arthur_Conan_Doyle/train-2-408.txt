I remembered Holmes’s injunction. “I have another appointment,” said I. “Very good. I will go alone. I have a note of Mr. Holmes’s address. You
can rely upon my being there within half an hour at most.” It was with a sinking heart that I reentered Holmes’s bedroom. For all
that I knew the worst might have happened in my absence. To my enormous
relief, he had improved greatly in the interval. His appearance was as
ghastly as ever, but all trace of delirium had left him and he spoke in
a feeble voice, it is true, but with even more than his usual crispness
and lucidity.
