“Fair son, indeed you speak wildly,” cried the Cardinal. “I pledge you
my word that neither my nephew Robert nor any of my train will take part
in the battle. And now I leave you, sire, and may God assoil your soul,
for indeed in all this world no men stand in greater peril than you and
those who are around you, and I rede you that you spend the night
in such ghostly exercises as may best prepare you for that which may
befall.” So saying the Cardinal bowed, and with his household walking
behind him set off for the spot where they had left their' horses,
whence they rode to the neighboring Abbey.
