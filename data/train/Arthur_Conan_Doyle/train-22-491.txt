“It's a good plan,” said McGinty. “The lodge will owe you a debt for
this. I guess when I move out of the chair I can put a name to the man
that's coming after me.” “Sure, Councillor, I am little more than a recruit,” said McMurdo; but
his face showed what he thought of the great man's compliment. When he had returned home he made his own preparations for the grim
evening in front of him. First he cleaned, oiled, and loaded his Smith &
Wesson revolver. Then he surveyed the room in which the detective was
to be trapped. It was a large apartment, with a long deal table in the
centre, and the big stove at one side. At each of the other sides were
windows. There were no shutters on these: only light curtains which drew
across. McMurdo examined these attentively. No doubt it must have struck
him that the apartment was very exposed for so secret a meeting. Yet its
distance from the road made it of less consequence. Finally he discussed
the matter with his fellow lodger. Scanlan, though a Scowrer, was an
inoffensive little man who was too weak to stand against the opinion of
his comrades, but was secretly horrified by the deeds of blood at which
he had sometimes been forced to assist. McMurdo told him shortly what
was intended.
