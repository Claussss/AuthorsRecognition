"Who, then, is this who comes to Alaga of Tyre, the handmaiden of great
Ashtaroth? Behold I see an island to the west, and an old man who is the
father, and the great chief, and his wife, and his son who now waits him
at home, being too young for the wars. Is this not true?" "Yes, maiden, you have said truth," the Greek answered. "I have had many great ones before me, but none greater than you, for
three thousand years from now people will still talk of your bravery and
of your wisdom. They will remember also the faithful wife at home, and
the name of the old man, your father, and of the boy your son--all will
be remembered when the very stones of noble Sidon and royal Tyre are no
more."
