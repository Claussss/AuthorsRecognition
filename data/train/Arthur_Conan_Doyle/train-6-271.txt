The knights and squires of the escort, most of whom were veterans of
the French war, had been gazing with interest and some surprise at the
steel-clad figure in front of them. Now at a call from Sir Walter Manny
they assembled round the spot where the King and Chandos had halted.
Chandos cleared his throat and read from his paper-- “'A tous seigneurs, chevaliers et escuyers,' so it is headed, gentlemen.
It is a message from the good Squire Nigel Loring of Tilford, son of Sir
Eustace Loring, of honorable memory. Squire Loring awaits you in arms,
gentlemen, yonder upon the crown of the old bridge. Thus says he: 'For
the great desire that I, a most humble and unworthy Squire, entertain,
that I may come to the knowledge of the noble gentlemen who ride with my
royal master, I now wait on the Bridge of the Way in the hope that some
of them may condescend to do some small deed of arms upon me, or that I
may deliver them from any vow which they may have taken. This I say out
of no esteem for myself, but solely that I may witness the noble bearing
of these famous cavaliers and admire their skill in the handling of
arms. Therefore, with the help of Saint George, I will hold the bridge
with sharpened lances against any or all who may deign to present
themselves while daylight lasts.”
