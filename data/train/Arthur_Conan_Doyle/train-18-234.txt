Clinging to the weather shrouds we could distinctly see ten or a dozen
frightened seamen who, when the light revealed our presence, turned
their white faces towards us and waved their hands imploringly. The poor
wretches had evidently taken fresh hope from our presence, though it was
clear that their own boats had either been washed away or so damaged as
to render them useless. The sailors who clung to the rigging were not, however, the only
unfortunates on board. On the breaking poop there stood three men who
appeared to be both of a different race and nature from the cowering
wretches who implored our assistance.
