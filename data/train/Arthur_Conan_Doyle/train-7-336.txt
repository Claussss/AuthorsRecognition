But Mrs. Belmont was still gazing with the same fixed intensity and the
same ivory face. Now, with a wild shriek of joy, she threw her two hands
into the air. “It's they!” she screamed. “They are saved! It's they,
Colonel, it's they! O Miss Adams, Miss Adams, it is they!” She capered
about on the top of the hill with wild eyes like an excited child. Her companions would not believe her, for they could see nothing, but
there are moments when our mortal senses are more acute than those who
have never put their whole heart and soul into them can ever realise.
Mrs. Belmont had already run down the rocky path, on the way to her
camel, before they could distinguish that which had long before carried
its glad message to her. In the van of the approaching party, three
white dots shimmered in the sun, and they could only come from the three
European hats. The riders were travelling swiftly, and by the time their
comrades had started to meet them they could plainly see that it was
indeed Belmont, Fardet, and Stephens, with the dragoman Mansoor, and the
wounded Soudanese rifleman. As they came together they saw that their
escort consisted of Tippy Tilly and the other old Egyptian soldiers.
Belmont rushed onwards to meet his wife, but Fardet stopped to grasp the
Colonel's hand.
