‘Who would have thought it of him?’ cried Sir Stephen, with flashing
eyes, as Buyse and Saxon rode out to meet him. ‘What think ye now of our
noble monarch, our champion of the Protestant cause?’ ‘He is no very great Krieger,’ said Buyse. ‘Yet perhaps it may be from
want of habit as much as from want of courage.’ ‘Courage!’ cried the old Mayor, in a voice of scorn. ‘Look over yonder
and behold your King.’ He pointed out over the moor with a finger
which shook as much from anger as from age. There, far away, showing
up against the dark peat-coloured soil, rode a gaily-dressed cavalier,
followed by a knot of attendants, galloping as fast as his horse would
carry him from the field of battle. There was no mistaking the fugitive.
It was the recreant Monmouth.
