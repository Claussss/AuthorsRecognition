head?” “I don't miss much, Mr. Holmes. Maybe I learned that from you. Yes, I
saw the picture--a young woman with her head on her hands, peeping at
you sideways.” “That painting was by Jean Baptiste Greuze.” The inspector endeavoured to look interested. “Jean Baptiste Greuze,” Holmes continued, joining his finger tips and
leaning well back in his chair, “was a French artist who flourished
between the years 1750 and 1800. I allude, of course to his working
career. Modern criticism has more than indorsed the high opinion formed
of him by his contemporaries.”
