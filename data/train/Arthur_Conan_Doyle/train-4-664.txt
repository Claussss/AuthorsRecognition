‘Truss me, would he? Todt und Holle!’ cried the other, whom the blow
and the brandy had driven to madness. ‘We shall see. Take that, thou
deyvil’s spawn, take that!’ He ran at me, and kicked me as hard as he
could with his heavy sea-boots. Some of the gang laughed, but the man who had spoken before gave
the Dutchman a shove that sent him whirling. ‘None of that,’ he said
sternly. ‘We’ll have British fair-play on British soil, and none of your
cursed longshore tricks. I won’t stand by and see an Englishman
kicked, d’ye see, by a tub-bellied, round-starned, schnapps-swilling,
chicken-hearted son of an Amsterdam lust-vrouw. Hang him, if the skipper
likes. That’s all above board, but by thunder, if it’s a fight that you
will have, touch that man again.’
