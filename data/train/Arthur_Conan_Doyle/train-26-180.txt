Another book which gives an extraordinarily vivid picture of the
man is this one--the Memoirs of Madame de Remusat. She was in daily
contact with him at the Court, and she studied him with those quick
critical eyes of a clever woman, the most unerring things in life
when they are not blinded by love. If you have read those pages, you
feel that you know him as if you had yourself seen and talked with
him. His singular mixture of the small and the great, his huge sweep
of imagination, his very limited knowledge, his intense egotism, his
impatience of obstacles, his boorishness, his gross impertinence to
women, his diabolical playing upon the weak side of every one with
whom he came in contact--they make up among them one of the most
striking of historical portraits.
