Having then got in touch with our dead, we proceed, naturally, to ask
them how it is with them, and under what conditions they exist.  It is
a very vital question, since what has befallen them yesterday will
surely befall us to-morrow.  But the answer is tidings of great joy.
Of the new vital message to humanity nothing is more important than
that.  It rolls away all those horrible man-bred fears and fancies,
founded upon morbid imaginations and the wild phrases of the oriental.
We come upon what is sane, what is moderate, what is reasonable, what
is consistent with gradual evolution and with the benevolence of God.
Were there ever any conscious blasphemers upon earth who have insulted
the Deity so deeply as those extremists, be they Calvinist, Roman
Catholic, Anglican, or Jew, who pictured with their distorted minds an
implacable torturer as the Ruler of the Universe!
