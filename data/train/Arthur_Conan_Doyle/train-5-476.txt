"Now, Master B.," said he, "I think I have pretty well drawn your
teeth.  You'll hear from me again, if you return to your old tricks.
And now good-morning, for I must go back to my studies." And such is the narrative of Abercrombie Smith as to the singular
events which occurred in Old College, Oxford, in the spring of '84.  As
Bellingham left the university immediately afterwards, and was last
heard of in the Soudan, there is no one who can contradict his
statement.  But the wisdom of men is small, and the ways of nature are
strange, and who shall put a bound to the dark things which may be
found by those who seek for them?
