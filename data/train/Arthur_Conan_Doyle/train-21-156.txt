"What the deuce is the matter with the dog?" growled Holmes. "They
surely would not take a cab, or go off in a balloon." "Perhaps they stood here for some time," I suggested. "Ah! it's all right.  He's off again," said my companion, in a tone of
relief. He was indeed off, for after sniffing round again he suddenly made up
his mind, and darted away with an energy and determination such as he
had not yet shown.  The scent appeared to be much hotter than before,
for he had not even to put his nose on the ground, but tugged at his
leash and tried to break into a run.  I cold see by the gleam in
Holmes's eyes that he thought we were nearing the end of our journey.
