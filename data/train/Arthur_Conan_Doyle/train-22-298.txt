The bar of McGinty's saloon was crowded as usual; for it was the
favourite loafing place of all the rougher elements of the town. The man
was popular; for he had a rough, jovial disposition which formed a
mask, covering a great deal which lay behind it. But apart from this
popularity, the fear in which he was held throughout the township, and
indeed down the whole thirty miles of the valley and past the mountains
on each side of it, was enough in itself to fill his bar; for none could
afford to neglect his good will.
