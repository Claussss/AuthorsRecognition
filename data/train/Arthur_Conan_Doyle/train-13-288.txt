      “Trevor senior was a widower, and my friend his only son.       “There had been a daughter, I heard, but she had died of
      diphtheria while on a visit to Birmingham. The father interested
      me extremely. He was a man of little culture, but with a
      considerable amount of rude strength, both physically and
      mentally. He knew hardly any books, but he had travelled far, had
      seen much of the world. And had remembered all that he had
      learned. In person he was a thick-set, burly man with a shock of
      grizzled hair, a brown, weather-beaten face, and blue eyes which
      were keen to the verge of fierceness. Yet he had a reputation for
      kindness and charity on the country-side, and was noted for the
      leniency of his sentences from the bench.
