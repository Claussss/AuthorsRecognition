The patrician smiled bitterly. "If it were not for our great ancestors
and for our beloved country, the Queen of the Waters," said he, "I could
find it in my heart to be glad at this destruction which has come upon
this vain and feeble generation. You have spent your life upon the seas,
Magro. You do not know how it has been with us on the land. But I have
seen this canker grow upon us which now leads us to our death. I and
others have gone down into the market-place to plead with the people,
and been pelted with mud for our pains. Many a time have I pointed to
Rome, and said, 'Behold these people, who bear arms themselves, each man
for his own duty and pride. How can you who hide behind mercenaries hope
to stand against them?'--a hundred times I have said it."
