      “I had a little talk with old Cunningham afterwards as to the
      motive of the crime. He was tractable enough, though his son was
      a perfect demon, ready to blow out his own or anybody else’s
      brains if he could have got to his revolver. When Cunningham saw
      that the case against him was so strong he lost all heart and
      made a clean breast of everything. It seems that William had
      secretly followed his two masters on the night when they made
      their raid upon Mr. Acton’s, and having thus got them into his
      power, proceeded, under threats of exposure, to levy blackmail
      upon them. Mr. Alec, however, was a dangerous man to play games
      of that sort with. It was a stroke of positive genius on his part
      to see in the burglary scare which was convulsing the country
      side an opportunity of plausibly getting rid of the man whom he
      feared. William was decoyed up and shot, and had they only got
      the whole of the note and paid a little more attention to detail
      in the accessories, it is very possible that suspicion might
      never have been aroused.”
