Aylward looked hard at the French boat. “I could swim ten times up and
down Frensham pond,” said he, “and it will be strange if I cannot go as
far as that. By these finger-bones, Samkin Aylward may be there as soon
as you!” The little boat with its five occupants pushed off from the side of
the schooner, and dipping and rising, made its slow way toward the
Frenchman. Badding and one archer had single oars, the second archer was
in the prow, while Black Simon and Nigel huddled into the stern with the
water lapping and hissing at their very elbows. A shout of defiance rose
from the Frenchmen, and they stood in a line along the side of their
vessel shaking their fists and waving their weapons. Already the sun was
level with Dungeness, and the gray of evening was blurring sky and
water into one dim haze. A great silence hung over the broad expanse of
nature, and no sound broke it save the dip and splash of the oars
and the slow deep surge of the boat upon the swell. Behind them their
comrades of the Marie Rose stood motionless and silent, watching their
progress with eager eyes.
