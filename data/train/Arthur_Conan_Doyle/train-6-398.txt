“It is a lie; he will not come,” said a voice from the door. It was the old priest, who had followed the others as far as the

my daughter, hearken to the words of one who is indeed old enough to be
your earthly father. This lie has served before. He has ruined others
before you with it. The man has no brother at Saint Albans. I know his
brothers well, and there is no priest among them. Before Monday, when
it is all too late, you will have found the truth as others have done
before you. Trust him not, but come with us!”
