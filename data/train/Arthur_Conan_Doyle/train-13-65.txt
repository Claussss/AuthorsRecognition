      “My friend and I return to town by the night-express,” said
      Holmes. “We have had a charming little breath of your beautiful
      Dartmoor air.”       The Inspector opened his eyes, and the Colonel’s lip curled in a
      sneer.       “So you despair of arresting the murderer of poor Straker,” said
      he.       Holmes shrugged his shoulders. “There are certainly grave
      difficulties in the way,” said he. “I have every hope, however,
      that your horse will start upon Tuesday, and I beg that you will
      have your jockey in readiness. Might I ask for a photograph of
      Mr. John Straker?”
