There's ane thing that I havena spoke aboot yet, but that should be set
doon. The general didna share his room wi' his wife, but slept a' alane in a
chamber at the far end o' the hoose, as distant as possible frae every
one else. This room was aye lockit when he wasna in it, and naebody was
ever allowed tae gang into it. He would mak' his ain bed, and red it up
and dust it a' by himsel', but he wouldna so much as allow one o' us to
set fut on the passage that led tae it.
