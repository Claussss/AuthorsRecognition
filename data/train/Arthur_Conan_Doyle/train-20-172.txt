      These were the main points of the servants’ evidence. In answer
      to Inspector Martin, they were clear that every door was fastened
      upon the inside, and that no one could have escaped from the
      house. In answer to Holmes, they both remembered that they were
      conscious of the smell of powder from the moment that they ran
      out of their rooms upon the top floor. “I commend that fact very
      carefully to your attention,” said Holmes to his professional
      colleague. “And now I think that we are in a position to
      undertake a thorough examination of the room.”
