“Here is Franklin Aylward,” said one of the brethren. “The horse was
his, and doubtless he will take it back to his farm.” But the stout red-faced farmer shook his head at the proposal. “Not I,
in faith!” said he. “The beast hath chased me twice round the paddock;
it has nigh slain my boy Samkin. He would never be happy till he had
ridden it, nor has he ever been happy since. There is not a hind in my
employ who will enter his stall. Ill fare the day that ever I took the
beast from the Castle stud at Guildford, where they could do nothing
with it and no rider could be found bold enough to mount it! When the
sacrist here took it for a fifty-shilling debt he made his own bargain
and must abide by it. He comes no more to the Crooksbury farm.”
