‘Go slow, friend--go slow, and heave your lead-line! You have got out
of your channel, and are in shoal water. I never said as how I was
betrothed.’ ‘What then?’ I asked. ‘I am getting up anchor now, to run down to her and summon her. Look
ye, lad,’ he continued, plucking off his cap and scratching his
ragged locks; ‘I’ve had to do wi’ wenches enow from the Levant to the
Antilles--wenches such as a sailorman meets, who are all paint and
pocket. It’s but the heaving of a hand grenade, and they strike their
colours. This is a craft of another guess build, and unless I steer wi’
care she may put one in between wind and water before I so much as
know that I am engaged. What think ye, heh? Should I lay myself boldly
alongside, d’ye see, and ply her with small arms, or should I work
myself clear and try a long range action? I am none of your slippery,
grease-tongued, long-shore lawyers, but if so be as she’s willing for a
mate, I’ll stand by her in wind and weather while my planks hold out.’
