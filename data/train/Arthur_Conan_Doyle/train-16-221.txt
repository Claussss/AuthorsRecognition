the facts were against him, and that he was incapable of taking an
unprejudiced view of the situation. "I only speak as an outsider," said I. "And now I must leave you, for I
have a long walk before me. Your story has interested me so much that I
should be glad if you could let me know the sequel." "Leave me your card," said he; and so, having bade him "good-night," I
left him.
