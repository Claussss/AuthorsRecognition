But if Nigel's friends had learned that this was the morning of his
leaving, his enemies too were on the alert. The two comrades had just
emerged from the Chantry woods and were beginning the ascent of that
curving path which leads upward to the old Chapel of the Martyr when
with a hiss like an angry snake a long white arrow streaked under
Pommers and struck quivering in the grassy turf. A second whizzed past
Nigel's ear, as he tried to turn; but Aylward struck the great war-horse
a sharp blow over the haunches, and it had galloped some hundreds of
yards before its rider could pull it up. Aylward followed as hard as he
could ride, bending low over his horse's neck, while arrows whizzed all
around him.
