clanking up to them across the courtyard. “My name, friend,” quoth the bowman. “Then sure I have no need to tell thee mine,” said the other. “By the rood! if it is not Black Simon of Norwich!” cried Aylward. “A
mon coeur, camarade, a mon coeur! Ah, but I am blithe to see thee!” The
two fell upon each other and hugged like bears.
