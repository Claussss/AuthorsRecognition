VII. The Reigate Squires       It was some time before the health of my friend Mr. Sherlock
      Holmes recovered from the strain caused by his immense exertions
      in the spring of â€™87. The whole question of the
      Netherland-Sumatra Company and of the colossal schemes of Baron
      Maupertuis are too recent in the minds of the public, and are too
      intimately concerned with politics and finance to be fitting
      subjects for this series of sketches. They led, however, in an
      indirect fashion to a singular and complex problem which gave my
      friend an opportunity of demonstrating the value of a fresh
      weapon among the many with which he waged his life-long battle
      against crime.
