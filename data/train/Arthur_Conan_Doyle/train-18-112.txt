language, for fear I should be accused of colouring my narrative for the
sake of effect. If, however, I have told my story with any approach to
realism, the reader will understand me when I say that by this time
the succession of dramatic incidents which had occurred had arrested
my attention and excited my imagination to the exclusion of all minor
topics.
