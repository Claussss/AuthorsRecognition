"I'll tell you what, Foster," says the alienist, "there is a side of
life which is too medical for the general public and too romantic for
the professional journals, but which contains some of the richest human
materials that a man could study. It's not a pleasant side, I am afraid,
but if it is good enough for Providence to create, it is good enough for
us to try and understand. It would deal with strange outbursts of
savagery and vice in the lives of the best men, curious momentary
weaknesses in the record of the sweetest women, known but to one or two,
and inconceivable to the world around. It would deal, too, with the
singular phenomena of waxing and of waning manhood, and would throw a
light upon those actions which have cut short many an honoured career
and sent a man to a prison when he should have been hurried to a
consulting-room. Of all evils that may come upon the sons of men, God
shield us principally from that one!"
