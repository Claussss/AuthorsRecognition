      “Then you leave my employment right away.”       “Very good, sir. If I must I must.”       “And you go in disgrace. By thunder, you may well be ashamed of

      years under this roof, and here I find you deep in some dark plot
      against me.”       “No, no, sir; no, not against you!” It was a woman’s voice, and

      was standing at the door. Her bulky figure in a shawl and skirt
      might have been comic were it not for the intensity of feeling
      upon her face.
