"Suppose that Cadogan West wished to make his way into the building
after hours; he would need three keys, would he not, before he could
reach the papers?" "Yes, he would.  The key of the outer door, the key of the office, and
the key of the safe." "Only Sir James Walter and you had those keys?" "I had no keys of the doors--only of the safe." "Was Sir James a man who was orderly in his habits?" "Yes, I think he was.  I know that so far as those three keys are
concerned he kept them on the same ring.  I have often seen them there."
