      The Prime Minister rose from the settee.       “What you say is perfectly logical, Mr. Holmes. I feel that the
      matter is indeed out of our hands.”       “Let us presume, for argument’s sake, that the document was taken
      by the maid or by the valet——”       “They are both old and tried servants.”       “I understand you to say that your room is on the second floor,
      that there is no entrance from without, and that from within no
      one could go up unobserved. It must, then, be somebody in the
      house who has taken it. To whom would the thief take it? To one
      of several international spies and secret agents, whose names are
      tolerably familiar to me. There are three who may be said to be
      the heads of their profession. I will begin my research by going
      round and finding if each of them is at his post. If one is
      missing—especially if he has disappeared since last night—we will
      have some indication as to where the document has gone.”
