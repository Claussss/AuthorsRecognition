grant that the innocent be not confounded with the guilty.” My father, when I reached home, was still in a ferment over his learned
disputation with the stranger. “I trust, Jack,” he said, “that I did not handle him too roughly. I
should remember that I am _in loco magistri_, and be less prone to argue
with my guests. Yet, when he took up this most untenable position, I
could not refrain from attacking him and hurling him out of it, which
indeed I did, though you, who are ignorant of the niceties of the
question, may have failed to perceive it. You observed, however, that my
reference to King Asoka's edicts was so conclusive that he at once rose
and took his leave.”
