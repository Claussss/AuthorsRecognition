Stephens, is there nothing we could do?” The Dervishes riding near were all Baggara with the exception of
one negro,--an uncouth fellow with a face pitted with smallpox. His
expression seemed good-natured when compared with that of his Arab
comrades, and Stephens ventured to touch his elbow and to point to his
water-skin, and then to the exhausted lady. The negro shook his head
brusquely, but at the same time he glanced significantly towards
the Arabs, as if to say that, if it were not for them, he might act
differently. Then he laid his black forefinger upon the breast of his
jibbeh.
