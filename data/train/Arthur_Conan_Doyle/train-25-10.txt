of my face: "only an ideal.  I've never met the kind of man I mean." "Tell me about him.  What does he look like?" "Oh, he might look very much like you." "How dear of you to say that!  Well, what is it that he does that I
don't do?  Just say the word,--teetotal, vegetarian, aeronaut,
theosophist, superman.  I'll have a try at it, Gladys, if you will only
give me an idea what would please you."
