"The light had flickered onwards, now stopping and now advancing, until
I could see two dark figures upon the other side of the moat.  I let
them scramble down the sloping bank, splash through the mire, and climb
half-way up to the gate, before I challenged them. "'Who goes there?' said I, in a subdued voice. "'Friends,' came the answer.  I uncovered my lantern and threw a flood
of light upon them.  The first was an enormous Sikh, with a black beard
which swept nearly down to his cummerbund.  Outside of a show I have
never seen so tall a man.  The other was a little, fat, round fellow,
with a great yellow turban, and a bundle in his hand, done up in a
shawl.  He seemed to be all in a quiver with fear, for his hands
twitched as if he had the ague, and his head kept turning to left and
right with two bright little twinkling eyes, like a mouse when he
ventures out from his hole.  It gave me the chills to think of killing
him, but I thought of the treasure, and my heart set as hard as a flint
within me.  When he saw my white face he gave a little chirrup of joy
and came running up towards me.
