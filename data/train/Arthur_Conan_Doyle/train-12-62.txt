“Good heavens!” cried Robert, as he gazed from case to case. “It is an
immense fortune in itself. Surely a hundred thousand pounds would hardly
buy so splendid a collection.” “I don't think that you would do for a valuer of precious stones,” said
Raffles Haw, laughing. “Why, the contents of that one little drawer
of brilliants could not be bought for the sum which you name. I have a
memo. here of what I have expended up to date on my collection, though
I have agents at work who will probably make very considerable additions
to it within the next few weeks. As matters stand, however, I have
spent--let me see-pearls one forty thousand; emeralds, seven fifty;
rubies, eight forty; brilliants, nine twenty; onyxes--I have several
very nice onyxes-two thirty. Other gems, carbuncles, agates--hum!
Yes, it figures out at just over four million seven hundred and forty
thousand. I dare say that we may say five millions, for I have not
counted the odd money.”
