We sat opposite to each other on either side of the table with no sound
breaking the silence save the measured ticking of the clock and the
intermittent chirping of a cricket beneath the grate. There was something awe-inspiring in the absolute stillness. The
whistling of a belated peasant upon the high road was a relief to us,
and we strained our ears to catch the last of his notes as he plodded
steadily homewards.
