      I had seldom heard my friend speak with such intensity of
      feeling.       “But surely,” said I, “the fellow must be within the grasp of the
      law?”       “Technically, no doubt, but practically not. What would it profit
      a woman, for example, to get him a few months’ imprisonment if
      her own ruin must immediately follow? His victims dare not hit
      back. If ever he blackmailed an innocent person, then indeed we
      should have him, but he is as cunning as the Evil One. No, no, we
      must find other ways to fight him.”
