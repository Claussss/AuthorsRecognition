All this was enough to make even a victorious monarch full of care; but
now Edward had thrown it all to the winds and was as light-hearted as
a boy upon a holiday. No thought had he for the dunning of Florentine

He was out with his hawks, and his thoughts and his talk should be of
nothing else. The varlets beat the heather and bushes as they passed,
and whooped loudly as the birds flew out.
