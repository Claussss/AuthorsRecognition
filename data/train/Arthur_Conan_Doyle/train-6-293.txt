X. HOW THE KING GREETED HIS SENESCHAL OF CALAIS 
It would have fared ill with the good name of Tilford Manor house and
with the housekeeping of the aged Dame Ermyntrude had the King's
whole retinue, with his outer and inner marshal, his justiciar, his
chamberlain and his guard, all gathered under the one roof. But by
the foresight and the gentle management of Chandos this calamity was
avoided, so that some were quartered at the great Abbey and others
passed on to enjoy the hospitality of Sir Roger FitzAlan at Farnham
Castle. Only the King himself, the Prince, Manny, Chandos, Sir Hubert de
Burgh, the Bishop and two or three more remained behind as the guests of
the Lorings.
