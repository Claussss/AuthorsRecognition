“Forty years have passed since I slew Ghoolab Shah, and forty times
I have gone through all the horrors of death, without attaining the
blessed peace which lies beyond. “I have no means of knowing in what shape my fate will come upon me. I
have immured myself in this lonely country, and surrounded myself with
barriers, because in my weaker moments my instincts urge me to take some
steps for self-protection, but I know well in my heart how futile it
all is. They must come quickly now, for I grow old, and Nature will
forestall them unless they make haste.
