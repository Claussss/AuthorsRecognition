man. “It is well certain that the French will not come to us, and surely
it is the more needful that we go to them. In sooth, any soldier who
sees us would smile that we should creep for three days along this road
as though a thousand dangers lay before us, when we have but poor broken
peasants to deal with.” But Robert Knolles shook his head. “We know not what are in these woods,
or behind these hills,” said he, “and when I know nothing it is my wont
to prepare for the worst which may befall. It is but prudence so to do.”
