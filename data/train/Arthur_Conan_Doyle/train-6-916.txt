Already the army had been gone a month, but news of it came daily to
the town, and such news as all men could read, for through the landward
gates there rolled one constant stream of wagons, pouring down the
Libourne Road, and bearing the booty of Southern France. The town was
full of foot-soldiers, for none but mounted men had been taken by the
Prince. With sad faces and longing eyes they watched the passing of the
train of plunder-laden carts, piled high with rich furniture, silks,
velvets, tapestries, carvings, and precious metals, which had been the
pride of many a lordly home in fair Auvergne or the wealthy Bourbonnais.
