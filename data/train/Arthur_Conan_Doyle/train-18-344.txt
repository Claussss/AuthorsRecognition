“Rushing to the window I drew the blind aside and looked out. You know
that the gravel-drive opens up so as to form a broad stretch immediately
in front of the house. Just in the centre of this clear space there
stood three men looking up at the house. “The moon shone full upon them, glistening on their upturned eyeballs,
and by its light I could see that they were swarthy-faced and
black-haired, of a type that I was familiar with among the Sikhs and
Afridis. Two of them were thin, with eager, aesthetic countenances,
while the third was kinglike and majestic, with a noble figure and
flowing beard.”
