“Now hark you, priest--if priest indeed you be--your gown and tonsure
will not save you if you play us false, for we are here of a set purpose
and we will go forward with it, come what may. Answer me and answer me
truly or it will be an ill night for you. In what part of the Castle
does this tunnel enter?”
