Down in the hall I found a number of the shipwrecked sailors, looking
all the better for their night's repose, who set up a buzz of pleasure
and gratitude upon seeing me. Arrangements had been made to drive them to Wigtown, whence they were to
proceed to Glasgow by the evening train, and my father had given orders
that each should be served with a packet of sandwiches and hard-boiled
eggs to sustain him on the way.
