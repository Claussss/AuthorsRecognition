In my fear I sat up amang my cairpets, like a puddock among
gowan-leaves, and I listened wi' a' my ears. A' was still again noo,
except for the dull tickin' o' the distant clock. Suddenly the soond cam again, as clear, as shrill, as shairp as ever,
and this time the general heard it, for I heard him gie a kind o' groan,
as a tired man might wha has been roosed oot o' his sleep. He got up frae his bed, and I could make oot a rustling noise, as though
he were dressin' himsel', and presently his footfa' as he began tae walk
up and doon in his room.
