      “What was this William doing there? Did he say anything before he
      died?”       “Not a word. He lives at the lodge with his mother, and as he was
      a very faithful fellow we imagine that he walked up to the house
      with the intention of seeing that all was right there. Of course
      this Acton business has put every one on their guard. The robber
      must have just burst open the door—the lock has been forced—when
      William came upon him.”
