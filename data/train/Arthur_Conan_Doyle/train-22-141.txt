“That is just the point which I want to come to, Mrs. Douglas. You have
known your husband only in England, have you not?” “Yes, we have been married five years.” “Have you heard him speak of anything which occurred in America and
might bring some danger upon him?” Mrs. Douglas thought earnestly before she answered. “Yes,” she said at
last, “I have always felt that there was a danger hanging over him. He
refused to discuss it with me. It was not from want of confidence in
me--there was the most complete love and confidence between us--but
it was out of his desire to keep all alarm away from me. He thought I
should brood over it if I knew all, and so he was silent.”
