“The pond shall be drained, holy father; I have already ordered it. Then
we shall plant pot-herbs on the mud bottom, and after we have gathered
them in, return the fish and water once more from the lower pond, so
that they may fatten among the rich stubble.” “Good!” cried the Abbot. “I would have three fish-stews in every
well-ordered house--one dry for herbs, one shallow for the fry and the
yearlings, and one deep for the breeders and the tablefish. But still, I
have not heard you say how the pike came in the Abbot's pond.”
