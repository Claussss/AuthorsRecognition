and estray the whole Church of England to please a few hot-headed

a pitched battle lost. Do you bring up your company, Sir Gervas, and we
shall do what we can to hold them in check until they come.’ ‘Hi, Masterton!’ cried the Baronet, spying one of his under-officers
among the crowd who were looking on, neither assisting nor opposing the
rioters. ‘Do you hasten to the quarters, and tell Barker to bring up the
company with their matches burning. I may be of use here.’
