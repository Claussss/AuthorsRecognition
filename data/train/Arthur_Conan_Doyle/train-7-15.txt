“What else strikes you as funny, Miss Sadie?” “Well, when you sent me the temple ticket and the little map, you
began your letter, 'Enclosed, please find,' and then at the bottom, in
brackets, you had '2 enclo.'” “That is the usual form in business.” “Yes, in business,” said Sadie, demurely, and there was a silence. “There's one thing I wish,” remarked Miss Adams, in the hard, metallic
voice with which she disguised her softness of heart, “and that is, that
I could see the Legislature of this country and lay a few cold-drawn
facts in front of them, I'd make a platform of my own, Mr. Stephens, and
run a party on my ticket. A Bill for the compulsory use of eyewash would
be one of my planks, and another would be for the abolition of those
Yashmak veil things which turn a woman into a bale of cotton goods with
a pair of eyes looking out of it.”
