XI. IN THE HALL OF THE KNIGHT OF DUPLIN 
The King had come and had gone. Tilford Manor house stood once more dark
and silent, but joy and contentment reigned within its walls. In one
night every trouble had fallen away like some dark curtain which had
shut out the sun. A princely sum of money had come from the King's
treasurer, given in such fashion that there could be no refusal. With
a bag of gold pieces at his saddle-bow Nigel rode once more into
Guildford, and not a beggar on the way who had not cause to bless his
name.
