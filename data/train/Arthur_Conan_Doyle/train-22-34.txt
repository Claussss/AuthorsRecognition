“All knowledge comes useful to the detective,” remarked Holmes. “Even
the trivial fact that in the year 1865 a picture by Greuze entitled
La Jeune Fille a l'Agneau fetched one million two hundred thousand
francs--more than forty thousand pounds--at the Portalis sale may start
a train of reflection in your mind.” It was clear that it did. The inspector looked honestly interested. “I may remind you,” Holmes continued, “that the professor's salary can
be ascertained in several trustworthy books of reference. It is seven
hundred a year.”
