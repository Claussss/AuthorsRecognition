      “There! there!” said Holmes, soothing, patting him upon the
      shoulder. “It was too bad to spring it on you like this, but
      Watson here will tell you that I never can resist a touch of the
      dramatic.”       Phelps seized his hand and kissed it. “God bless you!” he cried.
      “You have saved my honour.”       “Well, my own was at stake, you know,” said Holmes. “I assure you
      it is just as hateful to me to fail in a case as it can be to you
      to blunder over a commission.”
