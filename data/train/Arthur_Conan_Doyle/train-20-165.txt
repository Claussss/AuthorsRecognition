      seven miles’ drive he never opened his mouth. Seldom have I seen
      him so utterly despondent. He had been uneasy during all our

      was much around to interest us, for we were passing through as

      cottages represented the population of to-day, while on every
      hand enormous square-towered churches bristled up from the flat
