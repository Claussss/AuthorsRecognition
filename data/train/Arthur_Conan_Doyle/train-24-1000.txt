“Tut, tut!” cried Sir Nigel, laughing. “All these things may be had for
money; and I think, Don Diego, that five thousand crowns is not too much
for so renowned a knight.” “It shall be duly paid him.” “For some days we must keep you with us; and I must crave leave also to
use your shield, your armor, and your horse.” “My harness is yours by the law of arms,” said the Spaniard, gloomily. “I do but ask the loan of it. I have need of it this day, but it shall
be duly returned to you. Set guards, Aylward, with arrow on string, at
either end of the pass; for it may happen that some other cavaliers may
visit us ere the time be come.” All day the little band of Englishmen
lay in the sheltered gorge, looking down upon the vast host of their
unconscious enemies. Shortly after mid-day, a great uproar of shouting
and cheering broke out in the camp, with mustering of men and calling of
bugles. Clambering up among the rocks, the companions saw a long rolling
cloud of dust along the whole eastern sky-line, with the glint of spears
and the flutter of pennons, which announced the approach of a large body
of cavalry. For a moment a wild hope came upon them that perhaps the
prince had moved more swiftly than had been planned, that he had crossed
the Ebro, and that this was his vanguard sweeping to the attack.
