“I think, Nigel,” said Sir Oliver, striding across to the little knight,
“that we should all acquit ourselves better had we our none-meat, for
the sun is high in the heaven.” “By Saint Paul!” quoth Sir Nigel, plucking the patch from his eye,
“I think that I am now clear of my vow, for this Spanish knight was a
person from whom much honor might be won. Indeed, he was a very worthy
gentleman, of good courage, and great hardiness, and it grieves me that
he should have come by such a hurt. As to what you say of food, Oliver,
it is not to be thought of, for we have nothing with us upon the hill.”
