The packet was sealed at each end with black wax, bearing the impress
of the flying griffin, which I knew to be the general's crest. It
was further secured by a band of broad tape, which I cut with my
pocket-knife. Across the outside was written in bold handwriting: “J.
Fothergill West, Esq.,” and underneath: “To be handed to that gentleman
in the event of the disappearance or decease of Major-General J. B.
Heatherstone, V.C., C.B., late of the Indian Army.”
