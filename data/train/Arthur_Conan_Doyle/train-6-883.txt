“Nay, we have none of the highest of Brittany,” Beaumanoir answered.
“Neither a Blois, nor a Leon, nor a Rohan, nor a Conan, fights in our
ranks this day. And yet we are all men of blood and coat-armor, who are
ready to venture our persons for the desire of our ladies and the love
of the high order of knighthood. And now, Richard, what is your sweet
will concerning this fight?” “That we continue until one or other can endure no longer, for since it
is seldom that so many brave men draw together it is fitting that we see
as much as is possible of each other.”
