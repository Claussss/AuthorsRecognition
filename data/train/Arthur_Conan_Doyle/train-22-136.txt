“And yet when they arrived they found that the candle was out and that
the lamp had been lighted. That seems very remarkable.” Again Barker showed some signs of indecision. “I don't see that it was
remarkable, Mr. Holmes,” he answered after a pause. “The candle threw a
very bad light. My first thought was to get a better one. The lamp was
on the table; so I lit it.” “And blew out the candle?” Holmes asked no further question, and Barker, with a deliberate look
from one to the other of us, which had, as it seemed to me, something of
defiance in it, turned and left the room.
