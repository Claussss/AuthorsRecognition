But already the Lord of Pons had come in sight. He was a huge man upon
an enormous horse, so that together they seemed to fill up the whole
long dark archway under the oaks. He was clad in full armor of a brazen
hue with only his face exposed, and of this face there was little
visible save a pair of arrogant eyes and a great black beard, which
flowed through the open visor and down over his breastplate. To the
crest of his helmet was tied a small brown glove, nodding and swinging
above him. He bore a long lance with a red square banner at the end,
charged with a black boar's head, and the same symbol was engraved upon
his shield. Slowly he rode through the forest, ponderous, menacing, with
dull thudding of his charger's hoofs and constant clank of metal, while
always in front of him came the distant peal of the silver trumpet
calling all men to admit his majesty and to clear his path ere they be
cleared from it.
