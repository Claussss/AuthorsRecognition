“That is certainly a possible point of view. On the face of it you must
admit, however, that it is very strange that his two servants should
have been in a conspiracy against him and should have attacked him on
the one night when he had a guest. They had him alone at their mercy
every other night in the week.” “Then why did they fly?” “Quite so. Why did they fly? There is a big fact. Another big fact is
the remarkable experience of our client, Scott Eccles. Now, my dear
Watson, is it beyond the limits of human ingenuity to furnish an
explanation which would cover both of these big facts? If it were one
which would also admit of the mysterious note with its very curious
phraseology, why, then it would be worth accepting as a temporary
hypothesis. If the fresh facts which come to our knowledge all fit
themselves into the scheme, then our hypothesis may gradually become a
solution.”
