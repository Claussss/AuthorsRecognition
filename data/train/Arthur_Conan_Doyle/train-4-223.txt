would outstrip the horses and be lost in the darkness. Could we but come on running water we might put them off our track.’ ‘My horse cannot hold on at this pace for more than a very few minutes,’
Reuben cried. ‘If I break down, do ye go on, for ye must remember
that they are upon your track and not mine. They have found cause for
suspicion of the two strangers of the inn, but none of me.’
