Here and there dark, crab-like creatures scuttled across our path,
and hideous, flesh-coloured worms wriggled and writhed amid the sickly
reeds. Swarms of buzzing, piping insects rose up at every step and
formed a dense cloud around our heads, settling on our hands and faces
and inoculating us with their filthy venom. Never had I ventured into so
pestilent and forbidding a place. Mordaunt Heatherstone strode on, however, with a set purpose upon his
swarthy brow, and we could but follow him, determined to stand by him
to the end of the adventure. As we advanced, the path grew narrower
and narrower until, as we saw by the tracks, our predecessors had been
compelled to walk in single file. Fullarton was leading us with the dog,
Mordaunt behind him, while I brought up the rear. The peasant had been
sulky and surly for a little time back, hardly answering when spoken to,
but he now stopped short and positively refused to go a step farther.
