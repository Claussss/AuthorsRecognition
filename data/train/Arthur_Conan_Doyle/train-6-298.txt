John Chandos, however, had a fresh suggestion, and he cocked a roguish
eye as he made it: “Surely, my liege, your bounty is little needed in
this case. It is the ancient law of arms that if two cavaliers start
to joust, and one either by maladdress or misadventure fail to meet
the shock, then his arms become the property of him who still holds
the lists. This being so, methinks, Sir Hubert de Burgh, that the fine
hauberk of Milan and the helmet of Bordeaux steel in which you rode to
Tilford should remain with our young host as some small remembrance of
your visit.”
