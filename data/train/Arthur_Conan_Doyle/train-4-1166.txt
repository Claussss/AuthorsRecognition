‘I am much beholden to you, Saxon,’ I said at last, speaking slowly and
with some difficulty, for the words were hard to utter. ‘But I fear that
your pains have been thrown away. These poor country folk have none to
look after or assist them. They are as simple as babes, and as little
fitted to be landed in a strange country. I cannot find it in my heart
to leave them!’ Saxon burst out laughing, and leaned back in his seat with his long legs
stretched straight out and his hands in his breeches pockets.
