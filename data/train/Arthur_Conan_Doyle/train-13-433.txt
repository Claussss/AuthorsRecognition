      We passed the pretty cottage where the murdered man had lived,
      and walked up an oak-lined avenue to the fine old Queen Anne
      house, which bears the date of Malplaquet upon the lintel of the
      door. Holmes and the Inspector led us round it until we came to
      the side gate, which is separated by a stretch of garden from the
      hedge which lines the road. A constable was standing at the
      kitchen door.
