Elliott was in my tent with me having a quiet cheroot until about ten
o'clock. I then walked the rounds with my jemidar, and having seen that
all was right I turned in a little before eleven. I was just dropping off to sleep, for I was dog-tired after the day's
work, when I was aroused by some slight noise, and, looking round, I saw
a man dressed in Asiatic costume standing at the entrance of my tent. He
was motionless when I saw him, and he had his eyes fixed upon me with a
solemn and stern expression.
