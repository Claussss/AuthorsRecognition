A buzz had risen from the soldiers in the camp, and they all crowded in
one direction, rushing toward the castle wall. The knights and squires
rode after them, and when in view of the main gate, the cause of the
disturbance lay before them. On the tower above the portal three men
were standing in the garb of English archers, ropes round their necks
and their hands bound behind them. Their comrades surged below them with
cries of recognition and of pity.
