‘ye can see how the land lies. I have half a mind to let Monmouth carve
his own road, and to pitch my tent in this quiet English township.’ ‘Your tent, indeed!’ cried Reuben; ‘it is a brave tent that is furnished
with cellars of such wine as we are drinking. And as to the quiet, my
illustrious, if you take up your residence here I’ll warrant that the
quiet soon comes to an end.’
