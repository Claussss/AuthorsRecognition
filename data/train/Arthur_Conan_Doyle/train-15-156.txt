"Hark you," said the Prefect. "The Emperor has deigned to give you a
Roman name, since you have come into his service. Henceforth you are no
longer Theckla, but you are Maximus. Can you say it after me?" "Maximin," repeated the Barbarian, trying to catch the Roman word. The Emperor laughed at the mincing accent. "Yes, yes, Maximin let it be.
To all the world you are Maximin, the body-guard of Severus. When we
have reached Rome, we will soon see that your dress shall correspond
with your office. Meanwhile march with the guard until you have my
further orders."
