“I see well that you are indeed a master-bowman,” said old Wat, “and it
is comfort to my soul to think that if I fall I leave such a man behind
me to hold high the credit of our craft. Now gather your shafts and on,
for Sir Robert awaits us on the brow of the hill.” All day Knolles and his men marched through the same wild and deserted
country, inhabited only by these furtive creatures, hares to the strong
and wolves to the weak, who hovered in the shadows of the wood. Ever and
anon upon the tops of the hills they caught a glimpse of horsemen who
watched them from a distance and vanished when approached. Sometimes
bells rang an alarm from villages amongst the hills, and twice they
passed castles which drew up their drawbridges at their approach and
lined their walls with hooting soldiers as they passed. The Englishmen
gathered a few oxen and sheep from the pastures of each, but Knolles had
no mind to break his strength upon stone walls, and so he went upon his
way.
