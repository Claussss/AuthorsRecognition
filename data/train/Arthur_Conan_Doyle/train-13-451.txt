      His words were cut short by a sudden scream of “Help! Help!
      Murder!” With a thrill I recognised the voice of that of my
      friend. I rushed madly from the room on to the landing. The
      cries, which had sunk down into a hoarse, inarticulate shouting,
      came from the room which we had first visited. I dashed in, and
      on into the dressing-room beyond. The two Cunninghams were
      bending over the prostrate figure of Sherlock Holmes, the younger
      clutching his throat with both hands, while the elder seemed to
      be twisting one of his wrists. In an instant the three of us had
      torn them away from him, and Holmes staggered to his feet, very
      pale and evidently greatly exhausted.
