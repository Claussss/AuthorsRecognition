      As we drove up to the porticoed front door, I observed in front
      of it, beside the tennis lawn, the black tool-house and the
      pedestalled sundial with which we had such strange associations.
      A dapper little man, with a quick, alert manner and a waxed
      moustache, had just descended from a high dog-cart. He introduced
      himself as Inspector Martin, of the Norfolk Constabulary, and he
      was considerably astonished when he heard the name of my
      companion.
