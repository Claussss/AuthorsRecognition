“By Gar! I believe you are right,” said McGinty. “But what do you allow
that we should do about it?” “Why not go right down now and fix him?” someone suggested. “Ay, the sooner the better.” “I'd start this next minute if I knew where we could find him,” said
McMurdo. “He's in Hobson's Patch; but I don't know the house. I've got a
plan, though, if you'll only take my advice.” “Well, what is it?” “I'll go to the Patch to-morrow morning. I'll find him through the
operator. He can locate him, I guess. Well, then I'll tell him that
I'm a Freeman myself. I'll offer him all the secrets of the lodge for
a price. You bet he'll tumble to it. I'll tell him the papers are at my
house, and that it's as much as my life would be worth to let him come
while folk were about. He'll see that that's horse sense. Let him come
at ten o'clock at night, and he shall see everything. That will fetch
him sure.”
