“You are right, Robert. God-speed you on your way! And I would that I
were sailing under your banner, for I see clearly that you will take
your people where they may worshipfully win worship. Perchance I also
maybe in Brittany before the year is past.” The Prince turned to the task of gathering his weary people together,
and the Basilisks passed over the side once more and dropped down on to
their own little ship. They poled her off from the captured Spaniard
and set their sail with their prow for the south. Far ahead of them were
their two consorts, beating towards them in the hope of giving help,
while down Channel were a score of Spanish ships with a few of the
English vessels hanging upon their skirts. The sun lay low on the water,
and its level beams glowed upon the scarlet and gold of fourteen great
caracks, each flying the cross of Saint George, and towering high above
the cluster of English ships which, with brave waving of flags and
blaring of music, were moving slowly towards the Kentish coast.
