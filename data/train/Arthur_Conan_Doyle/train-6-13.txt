Of this famous but impoverished family, doubly impoverished by law and
by pestilence, two members were living in the year of grace 1349--Lady
Ermyntrude Loring and her grandson Nigel. Lady Ermyntrude's husband had
fallen before the Scottish spearsmen at Stirling, and her son Eustace,
Nigel's father, had found a glorious death nine years before this
chronicle opens upon the poop of a Norman galley at the sea-fight of
Sluys. The lonely old woman, fierce and brooding like the falcon mewed
in her chamber, was soft only toward the lad whom she had brought up.
All the tenderness and love of her nature, so hidden from others that
they could not imagine their existence, were lavished upon him.
She could not bear him away from her, and he, with that respect for
authority which the age demanded, would not go without her blessing and
consent.
