He was prolix, it may be admitted, but who could bear to have him
cut? He loved to sit down and tell you just all about it. His use of
letters for his narratives made this gossipy style more easy. First
_he_ writes and he tells all that passed. You have his letter. _She_
at the same time writes to her friend, and also states her views.
This also you see. The friends in each case reply, and you have the
advantage of their comments and advice. You really do know all about
it before you finish. It may be a little wearisome at first, if you
have been accustomed to a more hustling style with fireworks in
every chapter. But gradually it creates an atmosphere in which you
live, and you come to know these people, with their characters and
their troubles, as you know no others of the dream-folk of fiction.
Three times as long as an ordinary book, no doubt, but why grudge
the time? What is the hurry? Surely it is better to read one
masterpiece than three books which will leave no permanent
impression on the mind.
