March 31.  Mesmerized by Miss P. April 1.  Mesmerized by Miss P.  (Note-book A.) April 2.  Mesmerized by Miss P.  (Sphygmographic chart taken by
Professor Wilson.) April 3.  It is possible that this course of mesmerism may be a little
trying to the general constitution.  Agatha says that I am thinner and
darker under the eyes.  I am conscious of a nervous irritability which
I had not observed in myself before.  The least noise, for example,
makes me start, and the stupidity of a student causes me exasperation
instead of amusement.  Agatha wishes me to stop, but I tell her that
every course of study is trying, and that one can never attain a result
with out paying some price for it.  When she sees the sensation which
my forthcoming paper on "The Relation between Mind and Matter" may
make, she will understand that it is worth a little nervous wear and
tear.  I should not be surprised if I got my F. R.  S. over it.
