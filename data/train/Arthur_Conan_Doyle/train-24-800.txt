round just under the shoulder with a silken kerchief. But the surprise of the stranger at the sight of Sir Nigel was as
nothing compared with the astonishment and the delight which shone upon
the face of the knight of Hampshire as he looked upon the strange face
of the Frenchman. Twice he opened his mouth and twice he peered again,
as though to assure himself that his eyes had not played him a trick.
