      “‘It was the year ’55 when the Crimean war was at its height, and
      the old convict ships had been largely used as transports in the
      Black Sea. The government was compelled, therefore, to use
      smaller and less suitable vessels for sending out their
      prisoners. The _Gloria Scott_ had been in the Chinese tea trade,
      but she was an old-fashioned, heavy-bowed, broad-beamed craft,
      and the new clippers had cut her out. She was a five-hundred-ton
      boat, and besides her thirty-eight gaol-birds, she carried
      twenty-six of a crew, eighteen soldiers, a captain, three mates,
      a doctor, a chaplain, and four warders. Nearly a hundred souls
      were in her, all told, when we set sail from Falmouth.
