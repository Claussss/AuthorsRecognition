Brother and sister stared at the black and white crinkled note with
astonishment upon their faces. “Why, your unknown traveller must have been Monte Cristo, or Rothschild
at the least!” said Robert. “I am bound to say, Laura, that I think you
have lost your bet.” “Oh, I am quite content to lose it. I never heard of such a piece of
luck. What a perfectly delightful man this must be to know.” “But I can't take his money,” said Hector Spurling, looking somewhat
ruefully at the note. “A little prize-money is all very well in its way,
but a Johnny must draw the line somewhere. Besides it must have been
a mistake. And yet he meant to give me something big, for he could not
mistake a note for a coin. I suppose I must advertise for the fellow.”
