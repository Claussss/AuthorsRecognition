There was that in Knolles' cold gray eyes and in his manner of speaking
those last words which sent the portly envoy back at a quicker gait
than he had come. As he vanished into the gloomy arch of the gateway the
drawbridge swung up with creak and rattle behind him. A few minutes later a rough-bearded fellow stepped out over the portal
where the condemned archers stood and seizing the first by the shoulders
he thrust him over the wall. A cry burst from the man's lips and a deep
groan from those of his comrades below as he fell with a jerk which
sent him half-way up to the parapet again, and then after dancing like
a child's toy swung slowly backward and forward with limp limbs and
twisted neck.
