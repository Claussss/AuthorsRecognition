My brain is quite clear again now, and I can think over what has
occurred.  It is absurd to suppose that it is merely weakness and force
of habit.  I tried to explain it in that way the other night, but it
will no longer suffice.  It is something much deeper and more terrible
than that.  Why, when I was at the Mardens' whist-table, I was dragged
away as if the noose of a rope had been cast round me.  I can no longer
disguise it from myself.  The woman has her grip upon me.  I am in her
clutch.  But I must keep my head and reason it out and see what is best
to be done.
