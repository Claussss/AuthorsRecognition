I like none of these mystery-mongers, but the amateur least of all.
With the paid performer you may pounce upon him and expose him the
instant that you have seen through his trick.  He is there to deceive
you, and you are there to find him out.  But what are you to do with
the friend of your host's wife?  Are you to turn on a light suddenly
and expose her slapping a surreptitious banjo?  Or are you to hurl
cochineal over her evening frock when she steals round with her
phosphorus bottle and her supernatural platitude?  There would be a
scene, and you would be looked upon as a brute.  So you have your
choice of being that or a dupe.  I was in no very good humor as I
followed Wilson to the lady.
