      We turned a corner in the lane as he spoke, and there was the
      building close beside us. A yellow bar falling across the black
      foreground showed that the door was not quite closed, and one
      window in the upper story was brightly illuminated. As we looked,
      we saw a dark blur moving across the blind.       “There is that creature!” cried Grant Munro. “You can see for
      yourselves that some one is there. Now follow me, and we shall
      soon know all.”
