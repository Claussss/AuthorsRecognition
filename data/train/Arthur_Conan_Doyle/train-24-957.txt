“That is a very strong prod of yours,” said Johnston, shaking his
grizzled head as he glanced at the thick arch and powerful strings of
his rival's arbalest. “I have little doubt that you can overshoot me,
and yet I have seen bowmen who could send a cloth-yard arrow further
than you could speed a quarrel.” “So I have heard,” remarked the Brabanter; “and yet it is a strange
thing that these wondrous bowmen are never where I chance to be. Pace
out the distances with a wand at every five score, and do you, Arnaud,
stand at the fifth wand to carry back my bolts to me.”
