It was a long trumpet-shaped engine of leather and iron bolted into a
rude wooden stand and fitted with wheels. Beside it lay a heap of metal
slugs and lumps of stone. The end of the machine was raised and pointed
over the battlement. Behind it stood an iron box which Nigel opened. It
was filled with a black coarse powder, like gritty charcoal. “By Saint Paul!” said he, passing his hands over the engine, “I have
heard men talk of these things, but never before have I seen one. It is
none other than one of those wondrous new-made bombards.”
