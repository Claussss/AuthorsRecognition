A cable length from the shore we could see the mainmast of the barque
floating upon the waves, disappearing at times in the trough of the sea,
and then shooting up towards Heaven like a giant javelin, shining
and dripping as the rollers tossed it about. Other smaller pieces of
wreckage dotted the waters, while innumerable spars and packages were
littered over the sands. These were being drawn up and collected in
a place of safety by gangs of peasants. I noticed that a couple of
broad-winged gulls were hovering and skimming over the scene of the
shipwreck, as though many strange things were visible to them beneath
the waves. At times we could hear their raucous voices as they cried to
one another of what they saw.
