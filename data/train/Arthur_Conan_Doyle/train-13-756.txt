      “The night was fine, but still it was a very weary vigil. Of
      course it has the sort of excitement about it that the sportsman
      feels when he lies beside the water-course and waits for the big
      game. It was very long, though—almost as long, Watson, as when
      you and I waited in that deadly room when we looked into the
      little problem of the Speckled Band. There was a church-clock
      down at Woking which struck the quarters, and I thought more than
      once that it had stopped. At last however about two in the
      morning, I suddenly heard the gentle sound of a bolt being pushed
      back and the creaking of a key. A moment later the servants’ door
      was opened, and Mr. Joseph Harrison stepped out into the
      moonlight.”
