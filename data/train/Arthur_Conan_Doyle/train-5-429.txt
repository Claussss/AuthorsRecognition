"Not safe!  What do you mean?" "Ah, that's what I mustn't say.  But do take my advice, and move your
rooms.  We had a grand row to-day.  You must have heard us, for you
came down the stairs." "I saw that you had fallen out." "He's a horrible chap, Smith.  That is the only word for him.  I have
had doubts about him ever since that night when he fainted--you
remember, when you came down.  I taxed him to-day, and he told me
things that made my hair rise, and wanted me to stand in with him.  I'm
not strait-laced, but I am a clergyman's son, you know, and I think
there are some things which are quite beyond the pale.  I only thank
God that I found him out before it was too late, for he was to have
married into my family."
