“Why a fire?” he asked once. “Had they always a fire in this small room
on a spring evening?” Mortimer Tregennis explained that the night was cold and damp. For that
reason, after his arrival, the fire was lit. “What are you going to do
now, Mr. Holmes?” he asked. My friend smiled and laid his hand upon my arm. “I think, Watson, that
I shall resume that course of tobacco-poisoning which you have so often
and so justly condemned,” said he. “With your permission, gentlemen, we
will now return to our cottage, for I am not aware that any new factor
is likely to come to our notice here. I will turn the facts over in my
mind, Mr. Tregennis, and should anything occur to me I will certainly
communicate with you and the vicar. In the meantime I wish you both
good-morning.”
