Let me consider what I had better do.  I cannot leave the university in
the middle of the term.  If I were free, my course would be obvious.  I
should start at once and travel in Persia.  But would she allow me to
start?  And could her influence not reach me in Persia, and bring me
back to within touch of her crutch?  I can only find out the limits of
this hellish power by my own bitter experience.  I will fight and fight
and fight--and what can I do more?
