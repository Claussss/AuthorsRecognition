Their brave, unselfish devotion must do something to cleanse the name
for which they fought and suffered.  It was they who nursed the system
which promises to be, not a new religion--it is far too big for
that--but part of the common heritage of knowledge shared by the whole
human race.  Perfected Spiritualism, however, will probably bear about
the same relation to the Spiritualism of 1850 as a modern locomotive to
the bubbling little kettle which heralded the era of steam.  It will
end by being rather the proof and basis of all religions than a
religion in itself.  We have already too many religions--but too few
proofs.
