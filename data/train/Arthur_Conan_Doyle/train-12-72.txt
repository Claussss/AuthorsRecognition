Robert McIntyre nodded to show that he appreciated his position. “Now, you see,” he continued, “if I am to be cut off from the rich by
my own tastes, and from those who are not rich by my distrust of their
motives, my situation is an isolated one. Not that I mind isolation:
I am used to it. But it limits my field of usefulness. I have no
trustworthy means of informing myself when and where I may do good.
I have already, I am glad to say, met a man to-day, your vicar, who
appears to be thoroughly unselfish and trustworthy. He shall be one
of my channels of communication with the outer world. Might I ask you
whether you would be willing to become another?”
