For an hour these two friends rode together, the Frenchman pouring forth
the praises of his lady, whose glove he produced from one pocket, her
garter from his vest, and her shoe from his saddle-bag. She was blond,
and when he heard that Mary was dark, he would fain stop then and there
to fight the question of color. He talked too of his great chateau at
Lauta, by the head waters of the pleasant Garonne; of the hundred horses
in the stables, the seventy hounds in the kennels, the fifty hawks in
the mews. His English friend should come there when the wars were
over, and what golden days would be theirs! Nigel too, with his English
coldness thawing before this young sunbeam of the South, found himself
talking of the heather slopes of Surrey, of the forest of Woolmer, even
of the sacred chambers of Cosford.
