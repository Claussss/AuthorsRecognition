      “The windows are all dark,” remarked the inspector. “The house
      seems deserted.”       “Our birds are flown and the nest empty,” said Holmes.       “Why do you say so?”       “A carriage heavily loaded with luggage has passed out during the
      last hour.”       The inspector laughed. “I saw the wheel-tracks in the light of
      the gate-lamp, but where does the luggage come in?”       “You may have observed the same wheel-tracks going the other way.
      But the outward-bound ones were very much deeper—so much so that
      we can say for a certainty that there was a very considerable
      weight on the carriage.”
