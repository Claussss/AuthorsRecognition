      “Well,” said he, at last, “I suppose I shall have to come out and
      have a look at it.”       Stanley Hopkins gave a cry of joy.       “Thank you, sir. That will, indeed, be a weight off my mind.”       Holmes shook his finger at the inspector.       “It would have been an easier task a week ago,” said he. “But
      even now my visit may not be entirely fruitless. Watson, if you
      can spare the time, I should be very glad of your company. If you
      will call a four-wheeler, Hopkins, we shall be ready to start for
      Forest Row in a quarter of an hour.”
