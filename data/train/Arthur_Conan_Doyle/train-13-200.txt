      “Did she ever talk of revisiting the place?”       “No.”       “Or get letters from it?”       “No.”       “Thank you. I should like to think over the matter a little now.
      If the cottage is now permanently deserted we may have some
      difficulty. If, on the other hand, as I fancy is more likely, the
      inmates were warned of your coming, and left before you entered
      yesterday, then they may be back now, and we should clear it all
      up easily. Let me advise you, then, to return to Norbury, and to
      examine the windows of the cottage again. If you have reason to
      believe that it is inhabited, do not force your way in, but send
      a wire to my friend and me. We shall be with you within an hour
      of receiving it, and we shall then very soon get to the bottom of
      the business.”
