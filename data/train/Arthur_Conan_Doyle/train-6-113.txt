Even young Nigel Loring's blithe and elastic spirit was chilled as
he lay that night in the penal cell of Waverley and pondered over the
absolute ruin which threatened his house from a source against which all
his courage was of no avail. As well take up sword and shield to defend
himself against the black death, as against this blight of Holy Church.
He was powerless in the grip of the Abbey. Already they had shorn off
a field here and a grove there, and now in one sweep they would take in
the rest, and where then was the home of the Lorings, and where should
Lady Ermyntrude lay her aged head, or his old retainers, broken and
spent, eke out the balance of their days? He shivered as he thought of
it.
