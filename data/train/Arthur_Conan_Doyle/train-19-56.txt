April 6 (evening).  No, no, no, I did not overrate it.  I can no longer
attempt to conceal from myself that this woman has conceived a passion
for me.  It is monstrous, but it is true.  Again, tonight, I awoke from
the mesmeric trance to find my hand in hers, and to suffer that odious
feeling which urges me to throw away my honor, my career, every thing,
for the sake of this creature who, as I can plainly see when I am away
from her influence, possesses no single charm upon earth.  But when I
am near her, I do not feel this.  She rouses something in me, something
evil, something I had rather not think of.  She paralyzes my better
nature, too, at the moment when she stimulates my worse.  Decidedly it
is not good for me to be near her.
