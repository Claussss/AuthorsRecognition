He had scarce done so before Sir Nigel rode out from the holders'
enclosure, and galloping at full speed down the lists, drew his charger
up before the prince's stand with a jerk which threw it back upon
its haunches. With white armor, blazoned shield, and plume of
ostrich-feathers from his helmet, he carried himself in so jaunty and
joyous a fashion, with tossing pennon and curveting charger, that a
shout of applause ran the full circle of the arena. With the air of a
man who hastes to a joyous festival, he waved his lance in salute, and
reining the pawing horse round without permitting its fore-feet to touch
the ground, he hastened back to his station.
