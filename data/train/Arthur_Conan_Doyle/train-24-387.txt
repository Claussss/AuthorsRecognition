of the village innkeeper. “No more of thy nut-brown, mon gar. We leave
it behind us.” “By St. Paul, no!” cried the other. “You take it with you. Devil a drop
have you left in the great kilderkin. It was time for you to go.” “If your cask is leer, I warrant your purse is full, gaffer,” shouted
Hordle John. “See that you lay in good store of the best for our
home-coming.”
