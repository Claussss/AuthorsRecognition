“One other thing, sir,” I said hurriedly, for he was turning away, “I
hope that you will not be angry with your daughter for anything which I
have told you. It was for my sake that she kept it all secret from you.” “All right,” he said, with his cold, inscrutable smile. “I am not such
an ogre in the bosom of my family as you seem to think. As to this
marriage question, I should advise you as a friend to let it drop
altogether, but if that is impossible I must insist that it stand over
completely for the present. It is impossible to say what unexpected turn
events may take. Good-bye.”
