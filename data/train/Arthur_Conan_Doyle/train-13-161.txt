      My friend threw out the information in a very offhand way, but I
      saw that he cocked his eye at me to see if I had followed his
      reasoning.       “You think a man must be well-to-do if he smokes a seven-shilling
      pipe,” said I.       “This is Grosvenor mixture at eightpence an ounce,” Holmes
      answered, knocking a little out on his palm. “As he might get an
      excellent smoke for half the price, he has no need to practise
      economy.”
