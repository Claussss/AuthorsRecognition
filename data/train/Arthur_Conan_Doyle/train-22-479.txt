house. She's as true as steel and as deaf as a post. There's only
Scanlan and me in the house. If I get his promise--and I'll let you know
if I do--I'd have the whole seven of you come to me by nine o'clock.
We'll get him in. If ever he gets out alive--well, he can talk of Birdy
Edwards's luck for the rest of his days!” “There's going to be a vacancy at Pinkerton's or I'm mistaken. Leave it
at that, McMurdo. At nine to-morrow we'll be with you. You once get the
door shut behind him, and you can leave the rest with us.”
