      â€œHaving got so far, my next step was, of course, to examine into
      the details of the crime, and to see how far they would help us.
      I went up to the house with the Inspector, and saw all that was
      to be seen. The wound upon the dead man was, as I was able to
      determine with absolute confidence, fired from a revolver at the
      distance of something over four yards. There was no
      powder-blackening on the clothes. Evidently, therefore, Alec
      Cunningham had lied when he said that the two men were struggling
      when the shot was fired. Again, both father and son agreed as to
      the place where the man escaped into the road. At that point,
      however, as it happens, there is a broadish ditch, moist at the
      bottom. As there were no indications of bootmarks about this
      ditch, I was absolutely sure not only that the Cunninghams had
      again lied, but that there had never been any unknown man upon
      the scene at all.
