“The crystal box? Why was it?” “To preserve my guests from the effects of the changes of temperature.
It would be a poor kindness to bring them back to my smoking-room
drenched through, and with the seeds of a violent cold. The crystal has
to be kept warm, too, otherwise vapour would deposit, and you would have
your view spoiled. But must you really go? Then here we are back in the
smoking-room. I hope that it will not be your last visit by many a one.
And if I may come down to Elmdene I should be very glad to do so. This
is the way through the museum.”
