they are well loved by the folk in these parts, for they rob none of
them and have an open hand for all who will help them.” “It is right easy to have an open hand with the money that you have
stolen,” said Nigel; “but I fear that they will not try to rob two men
with swords at their girdles like you and me, so we shall have no profit
from them.”
