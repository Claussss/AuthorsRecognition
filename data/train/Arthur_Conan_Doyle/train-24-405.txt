king's service by every gadabout.” “Should you be a gentleman of quarterings and coat-armor,” lisped Sir
Nigel, “I shall be very blithe to go further into the matter with you.
If not, I have three very worthy squires, any one of whom would take the
thing upon himself, and debate it with you in a very honorable way.”
