      We were fortunate enough to catch an early train at Waterloo, and
      in a little under an hour we found ourselves among the fir-woods
      and the heather of Woking. Briarbrae proved to be a large
      detached house standing in extensive grounds within a few
      minutesâ€™ walk of the station. On sending in our cards we were
      shown into an elegantly appointed drawing-room, where we were
      joined in a few minutes by a rather stout man who received us
      with much hospitality. His age may have been nearer forty than
      thirty, but his cheeks were so ruddy and his eyes so merry that
      he still conveyed the impression of a plump and mischievous boy.
