      “‘Well, matters went from bad to worse with us, and this animal
      Hudson became more and more intrusive, until at last, on making
      some insolent reply to my father in my presence one day, I took
      him by the shoulders and turned him out of the room. He slunk
      away with a livid face and two venomous eyes which uttered more
      threats than his tongue could do. I don’t know what passed
      between the poor dad and him after that, but the dad came to me
      next day and asked me whether I would mind apologising to Hudson.
      I refused, as you can imagine, and asked my father how he could
      allow such a wretch to take such liberties with himself and his
      household.
