The travellers, nestling up against one another, had awaited, each after
his own fashion, the coming of the Arabs. The Colonel, with his hands
back in his trouser-pockets, tried to whistle out of his dry lips.
Belmont folded his arms and leaned against a rock, with a sulky frown
upon his lowering face. So strangely do our minds act that his three
successive misses and the tarnish to his reputation as a marksman was
troubling him more than his impending fate. Cecil Brown stood erect, and
plucked nervously at the upturned points of his little prim moustache.
Monsieur Fardet groaned over his wounded wrist. Mr. Stephens, in sombre
impotence, shook his head slowly, the living embodiment of prosaic
law and order. Mr. Stuart stood, his umbrella still over him, with no
expression upon his heavy face or in his staring brown eyes. Headingly
lay with that china-white cheek resting motionless upon the stones.
His sun-hat had fallen off, and he looked quite boyish with his ruffled
yellow hair and his unlined, clean-cut face. The dragoman sat upon a
stone and played nervously with his donkey-whip. So the Arabs found them
when they reached the summit of the hill.
