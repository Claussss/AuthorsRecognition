‘These popinjays of the Court are ready enough to wave their rapiers
and shout when there are four good miles between them and the foe,’
said Saxon, as we made our way through the crowd. ‘I fear that they will
scarce be as forward when there is a line of musqueteers to be faced,
and a brigade of horse perhaps charging down upon their flank. But here
comes friend Lockarby, with news written upon his face.’
