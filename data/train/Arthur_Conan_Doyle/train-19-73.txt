April 10.  All went very well last night.  I was amused at the
gardener's face when I had again to hail him this morning and to ask
him to throw up my key.  I shall get a name among the servants if this
sort of thing goes on.  But the great point is that I stayed in my room
without the slightest inclination to leave it.  I do believe that I am
shaking myself clear of this incredible bond--or is it only that the
woman's power is in abeyance until she recovers her strength?  I can
but pray for the best.
