Heavens! shall I ever forget the sight which greeted us? Right in front
of us was drawn up a triple line of Russian Grenadiers. Their muskets
rose as we entered, and a crashing volley burst into our very faces.
Oudin and Papilette dropped upon the floor, riddled with bullets. For myself, my busby was shot away and I had two holes through my
dolman. The Grenadiers ran at me with their bayonets. “Treason!” I
cried. “We are betrayed! Stand to your horses!” I rushed out of the
hall, but the whole square was swarming with troops.
