      and, descending into the hollow, he pushed the matting into a
      more central position. Then stretching himself upon his face and
      leaning his chin upon his hands, he made a careful study of the
      trampled mud in front of him. “Hullo!” said he, suddenly. “What’s

      mud that it looked at first like a little chip of wood.
