The latter days of the fighting men were often curious and
unexpected, though as a rule they were short-lived, for the
alternation of the excess of their normal existence and the
asceticism of their training undermined their constitution. Their
popularity among both men and women was their undoing, and the
king of the ring went down at last before that deadliest of
light-weights, the microbe of tubercle, or some equally fatal and
perhaps less reputable bacillus. The crockiest of spectators had a
better chance of life than the magnificent young athlete whom he
had come to admire. Jem Belcher died at 30, Hooper at 31, Pearce,
the Game Chicken, at 32, Turner at 35, Hudson at 38, Randall, the
Nonpareil, at 34. Occasionally, when they did reach mature age,
their lives took the strangest turns. Gully, as is well known,
became a wealthy man, and Member for Pontefract in the Reform
Parliament. Humphries developed into a successful coal merchant.
Jack Martin became a convinced teetotaller and vegetarian. Jem Ward,
the Black Diamond, developed considerable powers as an artist.
Cribb, Spring, Langan, and many others, were successful publicans.
Strangest of all, perhaps, was Broughton, who spent his old age
haunting every sale of old pictures and bric-a-brac. One who saw
him has recorded his impression of the silent old gentleman, clad in
old-fashioned garb, with his catalogue in his hand--Broughton, once
the terror of England, and now the harmless and gentle collector.
