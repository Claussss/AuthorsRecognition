Chapter XII The Strange Story of Jonathan Small A very patient man was that inspector in the cab, for it was a weary

there is no pay.  This night's work would have been worth a tenner each
to Sam Brown and me if the treasure had been there." "Mr. Thaddeus Sholto is a rich man," I said.  "He will see that you are
rewarded, treasure or no."
