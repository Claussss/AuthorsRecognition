“Who is warden here?” asked Chandos, springing from his horse. “Badding! Where is Cock Badding? Badding is warden!” shouted the crowd. A moment later a short swarthy man, bull-necked and deep-chested, pushed
through the people. He was clad in rough russet wool with a scarlet
cloth tied round his black curly head. His sleeves were rolled up to
his shoulders, and his brown arms, all stained with grease and tar, were
like two thick gnarled branches from an oaken stump. His savage brown
face was fierce and frowning, and was split from chin to temple with the
long white wale of an ill-healed wound.
