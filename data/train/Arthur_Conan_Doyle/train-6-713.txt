And yet there was special reason why upon this occasion the bowmen
wished to keep the deed in their own hands. Ever since their dispute
aboard the Basilisk, there had been ill-feeling betwixt Bartholomew the
old bald-headed bowyer, and long Ned Widdington the Dalesman, which had
ended in a conflict at Dinan, in which not only they, but a dozen of
their friends had been laid upon the cobble-stones. The dispute raged
round their respective knowledge and skill with the bow, and now some
quick wit amongst the soldiers had suggested a grim fashion in which
it should be put to the proof, once for all, which could draw the surer
shaft.
