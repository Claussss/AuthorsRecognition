‘There is a friend whom Sir Gervas Jerome did commend to my care,’ I
remarked; ‘I have, however, already taken measures to have his wishes
carried out. There is naught else save to assure all in Havant that a
King who hath battened upon his subjects, as this one of ours hath done,
is not one who is like to keep his seat very long upon the throne of
England. When he falls I shall return, and perhaps it may be sooner than
folk think.’
