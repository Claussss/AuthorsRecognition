      â€œBut for two of them, and one a woman, it must have been heavy
      work the raising of that stone. A burly Sussex policeman and I
      had found it no light job. What would they do to assist them?
      Probably what I should have done myself. I rose and examined
      carefully the different billets of wood which were scattered
      round the floor. Almost at once I came upon what I expected. One
      piece, about three feet in length, had a very marked indentation
      at one end, while several were flattened at the sides as if they
      had been compressed by some considerable weight. Evidently, as
      they had dragged the stone up they had thrust the chunks of wood
      into the chink, until at last, when the opening was large enough
      to crawl through, they would hold it open by a billet placed
      lengthwise, which might very well become indented at the lower
      end, since the whole weight of the stone would press it down on
      to the edge of this other slab. So far I was still on safe
      ground.
