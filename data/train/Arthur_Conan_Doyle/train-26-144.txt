The most obvious reason is his complete unconventionality. The
public read to be amused. The novelist reads to have new light
thrown upon his art. To read Meredith is not a mere amusement; it is
an intellectual exercise, a kind of mental dumb-bell with which you
develop your thinking powers. Your mind is in a state of tension the
whole time that you are reading him. If you will follow my nose as the sportsman follows that of his
pointer, you will observe that these remarks are excited by the
presence of my beloved "Richard Feverel," which lurks in yonder
corner. What a great book it is, how wise and how witty! Others of
the master's novels may be more characteristic or more profound, but
for my own part it is the one which I would always present to the
new-comer who had not yet come under the influence. I think that I
should put it third after "Vanity Fair" and "The Cloister and the
Hearth" if I had to name the three novels which I admire most in the
Victorian era. The book was published, I believe, in 1859, and it is
almost incredible, and says little for the discrimination of critics
or public, that it was nearly twenty years before a second edition
was needed.
