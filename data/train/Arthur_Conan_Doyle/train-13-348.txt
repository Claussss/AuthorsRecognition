      “You may remember how the affair of the _Gloria Scott_, and my
      conversation with the unhappy man whose fate I told you of, first
      turned my attention in the direction of the profession which has
      become my life’s work. You see me now when my name has become
      known far and wide, and when I am generally recognised both by
      the public and by the official force as being a final court of
      appeal in doubtful cases. Even when you knew me first, at the
      time of the affair which you have commemorated in ‘A Study in
      Scarlet,’ I had already established a considerable, though not a
      very lucrative, connection. You can hardly realize, then, how
      difficult I found it at first, and how long I had to wait before
      I succeeded in making any headway.
