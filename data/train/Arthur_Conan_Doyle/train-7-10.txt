“Ladies and gentlemen,” said he, plunging boldly into the rapid but
broken stream of his English, “to-morrow you will remember not to forget
to rise when the gong strikes you for to compress the journey before
twelve o'clock. Having arrived at the place where the donkeys expect us,
we shall ride five miles over the desert, passing a very fine temple of
Ammon-ra which dates itself from the eighteenth dynasty upon the way,
and so reach the celebrated pulpit rock of Abou-sir. The pulpit rock is
supposed to have been called so because it is a rock like a pulpit.
When you have reached it you will know that you are on the very edge of
civilisation, and that very little more will take you into the country
of the Dervishes, which will be obvious to you at the top. Having passed
the summit, you will perceive the full extremity of the second cataract,
embracing wild natural beauties of the most dreadful variety. Here all
very famous people carve their names,--and so you will carve your names
also.”
