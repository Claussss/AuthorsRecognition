have heard the valley so named,” said he. “The shadow does indeed seem
to lie heavy on some of you.” “It darkens every moment of our lives. Do you suppose that Ted Baldwin
has ever forgiven us? If it were not that he fears you, what do you
suppose our chances would be? If you saw the look in those dark, hungry
eyes of his when they fall on me!”
