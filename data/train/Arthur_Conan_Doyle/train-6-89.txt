“And this Sir Lorredan,” cried Nigel, “he died also, as I understand?” “I fear that he was slain by the archers, for they loved your father,
and they do not see these things with our eyes.” “It was a pity,” said Nigel; “for it is clear that he was a good knight
and bore himself very bravely.” “Time was, when I was young, when commoners dared not have laid their
grimy hands upon such a man. Men of gentle blood and coat-armor made
war upon each other, and the others, spearmen or archers, could scramble
amongst themselves. But now all are of a level, and only here and there
one like yourself, fair son, who reminds me of the men who are gone.”
