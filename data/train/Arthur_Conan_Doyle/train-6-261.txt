has gained her pitch.” “Nay, nay, she is far below,” said the King. “By my soul, my Lord Bishop is right!” cried the Prince. “I believe she
is above. See! See! She swoops!” “She binds! She binds!” cried a dozen voices as the two dots blended
suddenly into one. There could be no doubt that they were falling rapidly. Already they
grew larger to the eye. Presently the heron disengaged himself and
flapped heavily away, the worse for that deadly embrace, while the
peregrine, shaking her plumage, ringed once more so as to get high above
the quarry and deal it a second and more fatal blow. The Bishop smiled,
for nothing, as it seemed, could hinder his victory.
