Never had the dull round of the lives of the gentle brethren of Waverley
been broken by so fiery a scene. Springing to right and swooping to
left, now with its tangled wicked head betwixt its forefeet, and now
pawing eight feet high in the air, with scarlet, furious nostrils and
maddened eyes, the yellow horse was a thing of terror and of beauty. But
the lithe figure on his back, bending like a reed in the wind to every
movement, firm below, pliant above, with calm inexorable face, and
eyes which danced and gleamed with the joy of contest, still held its
masterful place for all that the fiery heart and the iron muscles of the
great beast could do.
