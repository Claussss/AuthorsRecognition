‘With all my heart,’ cried Sir Gervas. ‘Then here’s a bumper to our better acquaintance,’ cried Saxon, raising
his glass. ‘I pledge ye all,’ quoth the gallant. ‘Here’s to a fair fight, and may
the best men win.’ ‘Donnerblitz, man!’ said Saxon. ‘I believe there’s mettle in you for all
your gay plumes. I do conceive a liking for you. Give me your hand!’ The soldier of fortune’s great brown grip enclosed the delicate hand
of our new friend in a pledge of comradeship. Then, having paid our
reckoning and bade a cordial adieu to Dame Hobson, who glanced methought
somewhat reproachfully or expectantly at Saxon, we sprang on our steeds
and continued our journey amidst a crowd of staring villagers, who
huzzaed lustily as we rode out from amongst them.
