“I have sought you everywhere, dear Lady Maude,” said he in a

“Troubadour galloped as far as Holmhill ere I could catch him. I trust
that you have had no hurt or scath?” He shot a questioning glance at

sir,” she continued, springing into her saddle, “it is not fit that I
leave you without a word more. Clerk or no, you have acted this day as
becomes a true knight. King Arthur and all his table could not have done
more. It may be that, as some small return, my father or his kin may
have power to advance your interest. He is not rich, but he is honored
and hath great friends. Tell me what is your purpose, and see if he may
not aid it.”
