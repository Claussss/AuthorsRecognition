      It was a simple story which he had to tell, and one which did but
      confirm our own deductions. His visitor, on entering his rooms,
      had drawn a life-preserver from his sleeve, and had so impressed
      him with the fear of instant and inevitable death that he had
      kidnapped him for the second time. Indeed, it was almost
      mesmeric, the effect which this giggling ruffian had produced
      upon the unfortunate linguist, for he could not speak of him save
      with trembling hands and a blanched cheek. He had been taken
      swiftly to Beckenham, and had acted as interpreter in a second
      interview, even more dramatic than the first, in which the two
      Englishmen had menaced their prisoner with instant death if he
      did not comply with their demands. Finally, finding him proof
      against every threat, they had hurled him back into his prison,
      and after reproaching Melas with his treachery, which appeared
      from the newspaper advertisement, they had stunned him with a
      blow from a stick, and he remembered nothing more until he found
      us bending over him.
