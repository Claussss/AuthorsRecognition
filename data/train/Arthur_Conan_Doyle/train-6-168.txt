“And the Scotch?” asked Nigel. “You have made war upon them also, as I
understand.” “The Scotch knights have no masters in the world, and he who can hold
his own with the best of them, be it a Douglas, a Murray or a Seaton,
has nothing more to learn. Though you be a hard man, you will always
meet as hard a one if you ride northward. If the Welsh be like the furze
fire, then, pardieu! the Scotch are the peat, for they will smolder and
you will never come to the end of them. I have had many happy hours
on the marches of Scotland, for even if there be no war the Percies of
Alnwick or the Governor of Carlisle can still raise a little bickering
with the border clans.”
