Alleyne scarce saw his way to argue in the face of so decided an opinion
on the part of a high dignitary of the Church. “You have borne arms
against the Scots, then?” he asked. “Why, man, I first loosed string in battle when I was but a lad, younger
by two years than you, at Neville's Cross, under the Lord Mowbray.
Later, I served under the Warden of Berwick, that very John Copeland of
whom our friend spake, the same who held the King of Scots to ransom. Ma
foi! it is rough soldiering, and a good school for one who would learn
to be hardy and war-wise.”
