“Come now,” said I. “Tell me frankly what is the destination of our
voyage?” “Oh, didn't I tell you?” he answered. “We are bound for the Guinea coast
of Africa.” “Then how can that be in the highest interests of the Emperor?” I asked. “It is in his highest interests that you ask no indiscreet questions and
I give no indiscreet replies,” he answered, sharply. So he brought the
interview to an end, and I found myself back in my lodgings with nothing
save this bag of gold to show that this singular interview had indeed
taken place.
