“We will hear you,” said Knolles. “I have come from Evran yesterday,” said he. “Sir Henry Spinnefort, Sir
Peter La Roye and many other brave knights and squires lie there, with
a good company of men, all of whom would very gladly join with you to
destroy this butcher and his castle, for it is well known amongst us
that his deeds are neither good nor fair. There are also bombards which
we could drag over the hills, and so beat down this iron gate. If you so
order it I will ride to Evran and bring my companions back with me.”
