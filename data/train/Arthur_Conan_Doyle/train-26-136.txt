Of course, there are obvious disadvantages to the tale which is told
in letters. Scott reverted to it in "Guy Mannering," and there are
other conspicuous successes, but vividness is always gained at the
expense of a strain upon the reader's good-nature and credulity. One
feels that these constant details, these long conversations, could
not possibly have been recorded in such a fashion. The indignant and
dishevelled heroine could not sit down and record her escape with
such cool minuteness of description. Richardson does it as well as
it could be done, but it remains intrinsically faulty. Fielding,
using the third person, broke all the fetters which bound his rival,
and gave a freedom and personal authority to the novel which it had
never before enjoyed. There at least he is the master.
