      The detective stared at the newcomer with blank amazement. The
      latter was blinking in the bright light of the corridor, and
      peering at us and at the smouldering fire. It was an odious
      face—crafty, vicious, malignant, with shifty, light-grey eyes and
      white lashes.       “What’s this, then?” said Lestrade, at last. “What have you been
      doing all this time, eh?”       Oldacre gave an uneasy laugh, shrinking back from the furious red
      face of the angry detective.
