      “His coachman——”       “My dear Watson, can you doubt that it was to him that I first
      applied? I do not know whether it came from his own innate
      depravity or from the promptings of his master, but he was rude
      enough to set a dog at me. Neither dog nor man liked the look of
      my stick, however, and the matter fell through. Relations were
      strained after that, and further inquiries out of the question.
      All that I have learned I got from a friendly native in the yard
      of our own inn. It was he who told me of the doctor’s habits and
      of his daily journey. At that instant, to give point to his
      words, the carriage came round to the door.”
