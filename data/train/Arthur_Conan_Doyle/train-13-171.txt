      â€œI am a hop merchant myself, and as I have an income of seven or
      eight hundred, we found ourselves comfortably off, and took a
      nice eighty-pound-a-year villa at Norbury. Our little place was
      very countrified, considering that it is so close to town. We had
      an inn and two houses a little above us, and a single cottage at
      the other side of the field which faces us, and except those
      there were no houses until you got half way to the station. My
      business took me into town at certain seasons, but in summer I
      had less to do, and then in our country home my wife and I were
      just as happy as could be wished. I tell you that there never was
      a shadow between us until this accursed affair began.
