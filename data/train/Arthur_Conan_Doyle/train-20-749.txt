      There could be no doubt that we had reached the end of our
      journey. Pompey ran about and whined eagerly outside the gate,
      where the marks of the brougham’s wheels were still to be seen. A
      footpath led across to the lonely cottage. Holmes tied the dog to
      the hedge, and we hastened onward. My friend knocked at the
      little rustic door, and knocked again without response. And yet
      the cottage was not deserted, for a low sound came to our ears—a
      kind of drone of misery and despair which was indescribably
      melancholy. Holmes paused irresolute, and then he glanced back at
      the road which he had just traversed. A brougham was coming down
      it, and there could be no mistaking those grey horses.
