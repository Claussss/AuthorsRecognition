      “We have only to find to whom that telegram is addressed,” I
      suggested.       “Exactly, my dear Watson. Your reflection, though profound, had
      already crossed my mind. But I daresay it may have come to your
      notice that, counterfoil of another man’s message, there may be
      some disinclination on the part of the officials to oblige you.
      There is so much red tape in these matters. However, I have no
      doubt that with a little delicacy and finesse the end may be
      attained. Meanwhile, I should like in your presence, Mr. Overton,
      to go through these papers which have been left upon the table.”
