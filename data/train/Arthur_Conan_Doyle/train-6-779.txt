To right and left the men sprang down into the dry ditch, rolling with
screams upon the ground in their endeavor to extinguish the flames. The
knights and squires protected by their armor strove hard, stamping
and slapping, to help those who had but leather jacks to shield their
bodies. From above a ceaseless shower of darts and of stones were
poured down upon them, while on the other hand the archers, seeing the
greatness of the danger, ran up to the edge of the ditch, and shot fast
and true at every face which showed above the wall.
