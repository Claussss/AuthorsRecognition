My friend had sat with his head upon his hands, sunk in the deepest
thought. Now he rose and rang the bell. “Ames,” he said, when the butler
entered, “where is Mr. Cecil Barker now?” “I'll see, sir.” He came back in a moment to say that Barker was in the garden. “Can you remember, Ames, what Mr. Barker had on his feet last night when
you joined him in the study?” “Yes, Mr. Holmes. He had a pair of bedroom slippers. I brought him his
boots when he went for the police.”
