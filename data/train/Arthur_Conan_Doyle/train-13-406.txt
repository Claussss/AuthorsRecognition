      On referring to my notes I see that it was upon the 14th of April
      that I received a telegram from Lyons which informed me that
      Holmes was lying ill in the Hotel Dulong. Within twenty-four
      hours I was in his sick-room, and was relieved to find that there
      was nothing formidable in his symptoms. Even his iron
      constitution, however, had broken down under the strain of an
      investigation which had extended over two months, during which
      period he had never worked less than fifteen hours a day, and had
      more than once, as he assured me, kept to his task for five days
      at a stretch. Even the triumphant issue of his labours could not
      save him from reaction after so terrible an exertion, and at a
      time when Europe was ringing with his name and when his room was
      literally ankle-deep with congratulatory telegrams I found him a
      prey to the blackest depression. Even the knowledge that he had
      succeeded where the police of three countries had failed, and
      that he had outman≈ìuvred at every point the most accomplished
      swindler in Europe, was insufficient to rouse him from his
      nervous prostration.
