“By my hilt, he is gone!” cried Aylward, rushing to the side. “They have
sunk together like a stone.” “I am right glad of it,” answered Sir Nigel; “for though it was against
my vow to loose him, I deem that he has carried himself like a very
gentle and debonnaire cavalier.” CHAPTER XVII. HOW THE YELLOW COG CROSSED THE BAR OF GIRONDE. 
For two days the yellow cog ran swiftly before a northeasterly wind, and
on the dawn of the third the high land of Ushant lay like a mist upon
the shimmering sky-line. There came a plump of rain towards mid-day
and the breeze died down, but it freshened again before nightfall, and
Goodwin Hawtayne veered his sheet and held head for the south. Next
morning they had passed Belle Isle, and ran through the midst of a fleet
of transports returning from Guienne. Sir Nigel Loring and Sir Oliver
Buttesthorn at once hung their shields over the side, and displayed
their pennons as was the custom, noting with the keenest interest the
answering symbols which told the names of the cavaliers who had been
constrained by ill health or wounds to leave the prince at so critical a
time.
