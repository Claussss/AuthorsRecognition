"Of warning, Mr. Holmes?" "I have looked into this case with some care, and I am not convinced
that you are on the right lines.  I don't want you to commit yourself
too far unless you are sure." "You're very kind, Mr. Holmes." "I assure you I speak for your good." It seemed to me that something like a wink quivered for an instant over
one of Mr. Baynes's tiny eyes. "We agreed to work on our own lines, Mr. Holmes.  That's what I am
doing."
