“There is no need to go further,” said the Abbot. “He has confessed to
all. It only remains for me to portion out the punishment which is due
to his evil conduct.” He rose, and the two long lines of brothers followed his example,
looking sideways with scared faces at the angry prelate. “John of Hordle,” he thundered, “you have shown yourself during the two
months of your novitiate to be a recreant monk, and one who is unworthy
to wear the white garb which is the outer symbol of the spotless spirit.
That dress shall therefore be stripped from thee, and thou shalt be cast
into the outer world without benefit of clerkship, and without lot or
part in the graces and blessings of those who dwell under the care of
the Blessed Benedict. Thou shalt come back neither to Beaulieu nor to
any of the granges of Beaulieu, and thy name shall be struck off the
scrolls of the order.”
