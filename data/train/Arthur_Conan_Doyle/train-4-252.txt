‘Ho!’ said he, looking keenly at us. ‘Two of ye unused to war, and the
other an old soldier. Ye have been pursued, I see!’ ‘How did you know that, then?’ asked Decimus Saxon. ‘Ah, my friend, I too have served in my time. My eyes are not so old but
that they can tell when horses have been spurred to the utmost, nor is
it difficult to see that this young giant’s sword hath been employed in
something less innocent than toasting bacon. Your story, however, can
keep. Every true soldier thinks first of his horse, so I pray that you
will tether yours without, since I have neither ostler nor serving man
to whom I may entrust them.’
