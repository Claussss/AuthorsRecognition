“Good gracious!” cried the young artist, with staring eyes. “I have a certain feeling of duty in the matter. You see the cutting,
polishing, and general sale of stones is one of those industries which
is entirely dependent upon wealth. If we do not support it, it must
languish, which means misfortune to a considerable number of people. The
same applies to the gold filigree work which you noticed in the
court. Wealth has its responsibilities, and the encouragement of these
handicrafts are among the most obvious of them. Here is a nice ruby. It
is Burmese, and the fifth largest in existence. I am inclined to think
that if it were uncut it would be the second, but of course cutting
takes away a great deal.” He held up the blazing red stone, about the
size of a chestnut, between his finger and thumb for a moment, and then
threw it carelessly back into its drawer. “Come into the smoking-room,”
 he said; “you will need some little refreshment, for they say that
sight-seeing is the most exhausting occupation in the world.”
