April 11.  I hardly slept last night, and found myself in the morning
so unstrung and feverish that I was compelled to ask Pratt-Haldane to
do my lecture for me.  It is the first that I have ever missed.  I rose
at mid-day, but my head is aching, my hands quivering, and my nerves in
a pitiable state. Who should come round this evening but Wilson.  He has just come back
from London, where he has lectured, read papers, convened meetings,
exposed a medium, conducted a series of experiments on thought
transference, entertained Professor Richet of Paris, spent hours gazing
into a crystal, and obtained some evidence as to the passage of matter
through matter.  All this he poured into my ears in a single gust.
