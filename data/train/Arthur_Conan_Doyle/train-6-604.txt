The seamen of the Basilisk, being from a free port, had the old feud
against the men of the Cinque Ports, who were looked upon by the other
mariners of England as being unduly favored by the King. A ship of the
West Country could scarce meet with one from the Narrow Seas without
blood flowing. Hence sprang sudden broils on the quay side, when with
yell and blow the Thomases and Grace Dieus, Saint Leonard on their lips
and murder in their hearts, would fall upon the Basilisks. Then amid the
whirl of cudgels and the clash of knives would spring the tiger figure
of the young leader, lashing mercilessly to right and left like a tamer
among his wolves, until he had beaten them howling back to their work.
Upon the morning of the fourth day all was ready, and the ropes being
cast off the three little ships were warped down the harbor by their own
pinnaces until they were swallowed up in the swirling folds of a Channel
mist.
