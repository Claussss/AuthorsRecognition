But who shall ever dare to say that there is no hope, if he will but
give his griefs to the world? That very night Mrs. Spurling had received
a letter from her old school friend, Mrs. Louis Garraweg, with all her
fears and her hopes poured out in it, and the whole sad story of their
troubles. Swift from the Vicarage went the message to the Hall, and
early next morning Mr. Raffles Haw, with a great black carpet-bag in his
hand, found means to draw the cashier of the local branch of the Bank
of England from his breakfast, and to persuade him to open his doors
at unofficial hours. By half-past nine the crowd had already begun
to collect around Garraweg's, when a stranger, pale and thin, with a
bloated carpet-bag, was shown at his own very pressing request into the
bank parlour.
