      “By Jove, the doctor is coming back!” cried Holmes. “That settles
      it. We are bound to see what it means before he comes.”       He opened the door, and we stepped into the hall. The droning
      sound swelled louder upon our ears until it became one long, deep
      wail of distress. It came from upstairs. Holmes darted up, and I
      followed him. He pushed open a half-closed door, and we both
      stood appalled at the sight before us.
