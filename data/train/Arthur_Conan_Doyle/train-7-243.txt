either, to judge by the fuss they are making.” “It looks like it. Something has scared them.” “Now he's giving orders. What can it be? Here, Mansoor, what is the

brown face. “I think they have seen something to frighten them. I believe that
the soldiers are behind us. They have given the order to fill the
waterskins, and be ready for a start when the darkness comes. But I am
ordered to gather you together, for the Moolah is coming to convert
you all. I have already told him that you are all very much inclined to
think the same with him.”
