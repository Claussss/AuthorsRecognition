      â€œA small chamber about seven feet deep and four feet square lay
      open to us. At one side of this was a squat, brass-bound wooden
      box, the lid of which was hinged upwards, with this curious
      old-fashioned key projecting from the lock. It was furred outside
      by a thick layer of dust, and damp and worms had eaten through
      the wood, so that a crop of livid fungi was growing on the inside
      of it. Several discs of metal, old coins apparently, such as I
      hold here, were scattered over the bottom of the box, but it
      contained nothing else.
