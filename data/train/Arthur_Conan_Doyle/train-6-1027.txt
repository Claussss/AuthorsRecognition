“This is a hard saying,” said Sir John; “for indeed I have seen no
bolder better bird. Her wing was broken by a heron's beak last Sabbath
sennight, holy father, and Mary has the mending of it.” “I trust, my son, that you had heard mass ere you turned to worldly
pleasure upon God's holy day,” Father Matthew answered. “Tut, tut!” said the old knight, laughing. “Shall I make confession at
the head of my own table? I can worship the good God amongst his own
works, the woods and the fields, better than in yon pile of stone and
wood. But I call to mind a charm for a wounded hawk which was taught me
by the fowler of Gaston de Foix. How did it run? 'The lion of the Tribe
of Judah, the root of David, has conquered.' Yes, those were the words
to be said three times as you walk round the perch where the bird is
mewed.”
