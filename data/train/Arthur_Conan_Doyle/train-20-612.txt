      The unfortunate young man staggered back, and cast a look full of
      horror and reproach at Bannister.       “No, no, Mr. Gilchrist, sir, I never said a word—never one word!”
      cried the servant.       “No, but you have now,” said Holmes. “Now, sir, you must see that
      after Bannister’s words your position is hopeless, and that your
      only chance lies in a frank confession.”       For a moment Gilchrist, with upraised hand, tried to control his
      writhing features. The next he had thrown himself on his knees
      beside the table, and burying his face in his hands, he had burst
      into a storm of passionate sobbing.
