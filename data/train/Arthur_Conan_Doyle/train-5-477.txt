THE LOS AMIGOS FIASCO. I used to be the leading practitioner of Los Amigos.  Of course,
everyone has heard of the great electrical generating gear there.  The
town is wide spread, and there are dozens of little townlets and
villages all round, which receive their supply from the same centre, so
that the works are on a very large scale.  The Los Amigos folk say that
they are the largest upon earth, but then we claim that for everything
in Los Amigos except the gaol and the death-rate.  Those are said to be
the smallest.
