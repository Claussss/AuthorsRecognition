“Did you not investigate?” “No; the matter passed as unimportant.” “You left them, then, without any premonition of evil?” “None at all.” “I am not clear how you came to hear the news so early this morning.” “I am an early riser and generally take a walk before breakfast. This
morning I had hardly started when the doctor in his carriage overtook
me. He told me that old Mrs. Porter had sent a boy down with an urgent
message. I sprang in beside him and we drove on. When we got there we
looked into that dreadful room. The candles and the fire must have
burned out hours before, and they had been sitting there in the dark
until dawn had broken. The doctor said Brenda must have been dead at
least six hours. There were no signs of violence. She just lay across
the arm of the chair with that look on her face. George and Owen were
singing snatches of songs and gibbering like two great apes. Oh, it was
awful to see! I couldn’t stand it, and the doctor was as white as a
sheet. Indeed, he fell into a chair in a sort of faint, and we nearly
had him on our hands as well.”
