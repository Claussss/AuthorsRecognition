      “Well, well, you did your best,” said Holmes, as we walked into
      our room. “It’s very annoying, though, Watson. I was badly in
      need of a case, and this looks, from the man’s impatience, as if
      it were of importance. Halloa! That’s not your pipe on the table.
      He must have left his behind him. A nice old briar with a good
      long stem of what the tobacconists call amber. I wonder how many
      real amber mouthpieces there are in London. Some people think
      that a fly in it is a sign. Well, he must have been disturbed in
      his mind to leave a pipe behind him which he evidently values
      highly.”
