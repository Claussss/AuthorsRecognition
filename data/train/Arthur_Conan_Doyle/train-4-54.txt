‘Take help to those who need help’ said a voice out of the sea. ‘Zounds,
man, keep a guard on your oar! I fear a pat from it very much more than
I do the water.’ These words were delivered in so calm and self-possessed a tone that all
concern for the swimmer was set at rest. Drawing in our oars we faced
round to have a look at him. The drift of the boat had brought us so
close that he could have grasped the gunwale had he been so minded.
