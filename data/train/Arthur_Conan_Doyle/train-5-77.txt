"And what was it that struck you most now in connection with the whole
affair?" asked the colonel. "I lost three half-crowns over it, I did," crooned old Brewster.  "I
shouldn't wonder if I was never to get that money now.  I lent 'em to
Jabez Smith, my rear rank man, in Brussels.  'Only till pay-day, Grig,'
says he.  By Gosh! he was stuck by a lancer at Quatre Bras, and me with
not so much as a slip o' paper to prove the debt!  Them three
half-crowns is as good as lost to me."
