ready to assemble from their isolated castles for a raid into France,
and these with the addition of those English cavaliers who fought for
honor, and a few thousand of the formidable archers, hired for fourpence

Such were the materials of the Prince's force, some eight thousand
strong, who were now riding in a great circle through Southern France,
leaving a broad wale of blackened and ruined country behind them.
