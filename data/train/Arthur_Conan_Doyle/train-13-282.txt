      undoing the tape, he handed me a short note scrawled upon a
      half-sheet of slate-grey paper.       “The supply of game for London is going steadily up,” it ran.
      “Head-keeper Hudson, we believe, has been now told to receive all
      orders for fly-paper and for preservation of your hen-pheasant’s
      life.”       As I glanced up from reading this enigmatical message, I saw
      Holmes chuckling at the expression upon my face.
