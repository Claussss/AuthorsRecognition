Corporal Rufus Smith looked round at me in blank astonishment. “In the swim with us?” he said. “However did he get there?” “Voluntarily, voluntarily,” the general explained, hurriedly sinking his
voice. “He is a neighbour of mine, and he has volunteered his help in
case I should ever need it.” This explanation seemed, if anything, to increase the big stranger's
surprise. “Well, if that don't lick cock-fighting!” he exclaimed, contemplating me
with admiration. “I never heard tell of such a thing.”
