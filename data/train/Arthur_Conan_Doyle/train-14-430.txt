      “To walk across the moor?”       “Yes.”       “But that is the very thing which you have so often cautioned me
      not to do.”       “This time you may do it with safety. If I had not every
      confidence in your nerve and courage I would not suggest it, but
      it is essential that you should do it.”       “Then I will do it.”       “And as you value your life do not go across the moor in any
      direction save along the straight path which leads from Merripit
      House to the Grimpen Road, and is your natural way home.”
