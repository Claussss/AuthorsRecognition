‘Ye behold in me,’ said our host, bowing courteously to us, ‘the last of
an ancient family. I am Sir Jacob Clancing of Snellaby Hall.’ ‘Smellaby it should be, methinks,’ whispered Reuben, in a voice which
fortunately did not reach the ears of the old knight. ‘I pray that ye be seated,’ he continued, ‘and that ye lay aside your
plates and headpieces, and remove your boots. Consider this to be your
inn, and behave as freely. Ye will hold me excused if for a moment I
turn my attention from you to this operation on which I am engaged,
which will not brook delay.’
