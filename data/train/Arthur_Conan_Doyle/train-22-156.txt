Sherlock Holmes is so well known. Would you mind coming over and
speaking to Mrs. Douglas for one instant?” I followed him with a dour face. Very clearly I could see in my mind's
eye that shattered figure on the floor. Here within a few hours of the
tragedy were his wife and his nearest friend laughing together behind a
bush in the garden which had been his. I greeted the lady with reserve.
I had grieved with her grief in the dining room. Now I met her appealing
gaze with an unresponsive eye.
