      “Halloa! Stop there!” he shouted, holding his bicycle to block
      our road. “Where did you get that dog-cart? Pull up, man!” he
      yelled, drawing a pistol from his side pocket. “Pull up, I say,
      or, by George, I’ll put a bullet into your horse.”       Holmes threw the reins into my lap and sprang down from the cart.       “You’re the man we want to see. Where is Miss Violet Smith?” he
      said, in his quick, clear way.
