      “About a quarter of a mile from the stables John Straker’s
      overcoat was flapping from a furze-bush. Immediately beyond there
      was a bowl-shaped depression in the moor, and at the bottom of
      this was found the dead body of the unfortunate trainer. His head
      had been shattered by a savage blow from some heavy weapon, and
      he was wounded on the thigh, where there was a long, clean cut,
      inflicted evidently by some very sharp instrument. It was clear,
      however, that Straker had defended himself vigorously against his
      assailants, for in his right hand he held a small knife, which
      was clotted with blood up to the handle, while in his left he
      clasped a red and black silk cravat, which was recognised by the
      maid as having been worn on the preceding evening by the stranger
      who had visited the stables.
