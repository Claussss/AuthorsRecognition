      question of who killed John Straker.”       “And you will devote yourself to that?”       “On the contrary, we both go back to London by the night train.”       I was thunderstruck by my friend’s words. We had only been a few
      hours in Devonshire, and that he should give up an investigation
      which he had begun so brilliantly was quite incomprehensible to
      me. Not a word more could I draw from him until we were back at
      the trainer’s house. The Colonel and the Inspector were awaiting
      us in the parlour.
