     "Sir Arthur had a budget of notes, but after he had turned over a
     few pages he sallied forth with fluent independence under the
     inspiration of a vast mental store of material. A finger jutted out
     now and again with a thrust of passionate emphasis, or his big
     glasses twirled during moments of descriptive ease, and
     occasionally both hands were held forward as though delivering
     settled points to the audience for its examination. A clear,
     well-disciplined voice, excellent diction, and conspicuous
     sincerity of manner marked the lecture, and no one could have found
     fault with the way in which Sir Arthur presented his case."
