It is in the heart of the great Cistercian monastery that this chronicle
of old days must take its start, as we trace the feud betwixt the monks
and the house of Loring, with those events to which it gave birth,
ending with the coming of Chandos, the strange spear-running of Tilford
Bridge and the deeds with which Nigel won fame in the wars. Elsewhere,
in the chronicle of the White Company, it has been set forth what manner
of man was Nigel Loring. Those who love him may read herein those things
which went to his making. Let us go back together and gaze upon this
green stage of England, the scenery, hill, plain and river even as now,
the actors in much our very selves, in much also so changed in thought
and act that they might be dwellers in another world to ours.
