The experienced eye of the seaman told him that it was hopeless to
expect a breeze before nightfall. He looked across at the Frenchman,
which lay less than a quarter of a mile ahead, and shook his gnarled
fist at the line of heads which could be seen looking back over her
stern. One of them waved a white kerchief in derision, and Cock Badding
swore a bitter oath at the sight. “By Saint Leonard of Winchelsea,” he cried, “I will rub my side up
against her yet! Out with the skiff, lads, and two of you to the oars.
Make fast the line to the mast, Will. Do you go in the boat, Hugh, and
I'll make the second. Now if we bend our backs to it we may have them
yet ere night cover them.”
