      â€œWell, I took to my heels, and I ran after the cab. I had a heavy
      oak stick in my hand, and I tell you I saw red from the first;
      but as I ran I got cunning, too, and hung back a little to see
      them without being seen. They pulled up soon at the railway
      station. There was a good crowd round the booking-office, so I
      got quite close to them without being seen. They took tickets for
      New Brighton. So did I, but I got in three carriages behind them.
      When we reached it they walked along the Parade, and I was never
      more than a hundred yards from them. At last I saw them hire a
      boat and start for a row, for it was a very hot day, and they
      thought, no doubt, that it would be cooler on the water.
