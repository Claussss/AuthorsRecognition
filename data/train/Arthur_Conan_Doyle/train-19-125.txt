She was frightened, I could see, though she tried to brazen it out.
She read the black thought in my mind, and cowered away from me. "She is fortunate in having such a champion," said she.  "He actually
dares to threaten a lonely woman.  I must really congratulate Miss
Marden upon her protector." The words were bitter, but the voice and manner were more acid still. "There is no use talking," said I.  "I only came here to tell you,--and
to tell you most solemnly,--that your next outrage upon me will be your
last."  With that, as I heard Wilson's step upon the stair, I walked
from the room.  Ay, she may look venomous and deadly, but, for all
that, she is beginning to see now that she has as much to fear from me
as I can have from her.  Murder!  It has an ugly sound.  But you don't
talk of murdering a snake or of murdering a tiger.  Let her have a care
now.
