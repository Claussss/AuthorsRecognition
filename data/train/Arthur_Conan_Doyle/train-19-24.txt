"We must consider it all at an end." "But you left me last night without a hint at any disagreement.  What
could have occurred in the interval to change you so?  It must have
been something that happened last night.  You have been thinking it
over and you have disapproved of my conduct.  Was it the mesmerism?
Did you blame me for letting that woman exercise her power over you?
You know that at the least sign I should have interfered."
