When we translate Bible language into the terms of modern psychic
religion the correspondence becomes evident.  It does not take much
alteration.  Thus for "Lo, a miracle!" we say "This is a
manifestation."  "The angel of the Lord" becomes "a high spirit."
Where we talked of "a voice from heaven," we say "the direct voice."
"His eyes were opened and he saw a vision" means "he became
clairvoyant."  It is only the occultist who can possibly understand the
Scriptures as being a real exact record of events.
