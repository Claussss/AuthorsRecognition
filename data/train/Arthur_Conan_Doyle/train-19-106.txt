Well, the crash which I had foreseen has come--and that no further back
than yesterday.  The university authorities have taken my lectureship
from me.  It has been done in the most delicate way, purporting to be a
temporary measure to relieve me from the effects of overwork, and to
give me the opportunity of recovering my health.  None the less, it has
been done, and I am no longer Professor Gilroy.  The laboratory is
still in my charge, but I have little doubt that that also will soon go.
