"Good-evening," said he.  "Won't you come in?" "No," cried Smith, fiercely. "No?  You are busy as ever?  I wanted to ask you about Lee.  I was
sorry to hear that there was a rumour that something was amiss with
him." His features were grave, but there was the gleam of a hidden laugh in
his eyes as he spoke.  Smith saw it, and he could have knocked him down
for it. "You'll be sorrier still to hear that Monkhouse Lee is doing very well,
and is out of all danger," he answered.  "Your hellish tricks have not
come off this time.  Oh, you needn't try to brazen it out.  I know all
about it."
