no one will be the loser save ourselves.” “I did not come to draw out, but to put in,” said Raffles Haw in his
demure apologetic fashion. “I have in my bag five thousand hundred-pound
Bank of England notes. If you will have the goodness to place them to my
credit account I should be extremely obliged.”
