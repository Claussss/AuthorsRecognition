      “‘One evening, about the third week after our start, the doctor
      had come down to see one of the prisoners who was ill, and
      putting his hand down on the bottom of his bunk he felt the
      outline of the pistols. If he had been silent he might have blown
      the whole thing, but he was a nervous little chap, so he gave a
      cry of surprise and turned so pale that the man knew what was up
      in an instant and seized him. He was gagged before he could give
      the alarm, and tied down upon the bed. He had unlocked the door
      that led to the deck, and we were through it in a rush. The two
      sentries were shot down, and so was a corporal who came running
      to see what was the matter. There were two more soldiers at the
      door of the state-room, and their muskets seemed not to be
      loaded, for they never fired upon us, and they were shot while
      trying to fix their bayonets. Then we rushed on into the
      captain’s cabin, but as we pushed open the door there was an
      explosion from within, and there he lay with his brains smeared
      over the chart of the Atlantic which was pinned upon the table,
      while the chaplain stood with a smoking pistol in his hand at his
      elbow. The two mates had both been seized by the crew, and the
      whole business seemed to be settled.
