His mind, which was comprehensive and alert in warfare, was
singularly limited in civil affairs. As a statesman he was so
constant an example of devotion to duty, self-sacrifice, and high
disinterested character, that the country was the better for his
presence. But he fiercely opposed Catholic Emancipation, the Reform
Bill, and everything upon which our modern life is founded. He could
never be brought to see that a pyramid should stand on its base and
not on its apex, and that the larger the pyramid, the broader should
be the base. Even in military affairs he was averse from every
change, and I know of no improvements which came from his initiative
during all those years when his authority was supreme. The floggings
which broke a man's spirit and self-respect, the leathern stock
which hampered his movements, all the old traditional regime
found a champion in him. On the other hand, he strongly opposed the
introduction of the percussion cap as opposed to the flint and steel
in the musket. Neither in war nor in politics did he rightly judge
the future.
