There is the first proof of preternatural agency, since Miss Cameron
developed so much knowledge which she could not have normally acquired,
using many phrases and ideas which were characteristic of the deceased.
But mark the sequel.  Gaylord was merely a pseudonym, as the matter was
so private that the real name, which we will put as Bridger, was not
disclosed.  A few months after the book was published Miss Cameron
received a letter from a stranger living a thousand miles away.  This
letter and the whole correspondence I have seen.  The stranger, Mrs.
Nicol, says that as a test she would like to ask whether the real name
given as Fred Gaylord in the book is not Fred Bridger, as she had
psychic reasons for believing so.  Miss Cameron replied that it was so,
and expressed her great surprise that so secret and private a matter
should have been correctly stated.  Mrs. Nicol then explained that she
and her husband, both connected with journalism and both absolutely
agnostic, had discovered that she had the power of automatic writing.
That while, using this power she had received communications purporting
to come from Fred Bridger whom they had known in life, and that upon
reading Miss Cameron's book they had received from Fred Bridger the
assurance that he was the same person as the Fred Gaylord of Miss
Cameron.
