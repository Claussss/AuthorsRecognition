He threw up his arms at the last words with a fierce, threatening
gesture, and, turning away from me, strode back to the ruined hut. I stood gazing after him until he disappeared through the doorway, and
then started off for home, revolving in my mind all that I had heard,
and more particularly this last outburst of the occult philosopher. Far on the right I could see the tall, white tower of Cloomber standing
out clear-cut and sharp against a dark cloud-bank which rose behind it.
I thought how any traveller who chanced to pass that way would envy in
his heart the tenant of that magnificent building, and how little
they would guess the strange terrors, the nameless dangers, which were
gathering about his head. The black cloud-wrack was but the image, I
reflected, of the darker, more sombre storm which was about to burst.
