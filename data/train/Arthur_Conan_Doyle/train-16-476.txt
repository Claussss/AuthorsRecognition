Crabbe went down with his young degree, and a still younger wife, to
settle in this town, which we will call Brisport. I was acting as
assistant to a medical man in Manchester, and heard little from my
former friend, save that he had set up in considerable style, and was
making a bid for a high-class practice at once. I read one most deep and
erudite paper in a medical journal, entitled "Curious Development of a
Discopherous Bone in the Stomach of a Duck," which emanated from his
pen, but beyond this and some remarks on the embryology of fishes he
seemed strangely quiet.
