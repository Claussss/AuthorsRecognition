‘The accursed hounds!’ cried Saxon, putting spurs to his horse and
shooting ahead of us; ‘I feared as much. They have freed them from the
leash. There is no escape from the devils, but we can choose the spot
where we shall make our stand.’ ‘Come on, Reuben,’ I shouted. ‘We have only to reckon with the dogs now.
Their masters have let them loose, and turned back for Salisbury.’ ‘Pray heaven they break their necks before they get there!’ he cried.
‘They set dogs on us as though we were rats in a cock-pit. Yet they call
England a Christian country! It’s no use, Micah. Poor Dido can’t stir
another step.’
