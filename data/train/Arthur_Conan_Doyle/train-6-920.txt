There a great army had assembled early in September, whilst the Prince,
all unconscious of its presence sacked towns and besieged castles from
Bourges to Issodun, passing Romorautin, and so onward to Vierzon and to
Tours. From week to week there were merry skirmishes at barriers, brisk
assaults of fortresses in which much honor was won, knightly meetings
with detached parties of Frenchmen and occasional spear-runnings where
noble champions deigned to venture their persons. Houses, too, were
to be plundered, while wine and women were in plenty. Never had either
knights or archers had so pleasant and profitable an excursion, so that
it was with high heart and much hope of pleasant days at Bordeaux with
their pockets full of money that the army turned south from the Loire
and began to retrace its steps to the seaboard city.
