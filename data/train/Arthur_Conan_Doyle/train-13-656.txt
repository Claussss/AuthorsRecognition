      Our acquaintance looked surprised, and then, glancing down, he
      began to laugh.       “Of course you saw the ‘J.H.’ monogram on my locket,” said he.
      “For a moment I thought you had done something clever. Joseph
      Harrison is my name, and as Percy is to marry my sister Annie I
      shall at least be a relation by marriage. You will find my sister
      in his room, for she has nursed him hand-and-foot this two months
      back. Perhaps we’d better go in at once, for I know how impatient
      he is.”
