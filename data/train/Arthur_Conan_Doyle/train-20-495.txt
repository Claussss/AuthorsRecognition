      “That’s rather vague,” said Sherlock Holmes. “My, it might be a
      description of Watson!”       “It’s true,” said the inspector, with amusement. “It might be a
      description of Watson.”       “Well, I’m afraid I can’t help you, Lestrade,” said Holmes. “The
      fact is that I knew this fellow Milverton, that I considered him
      one of the most dangerous men in London, and that I think there
      are certain crimes which the law cannot touch, and which
      therefore, to some extent, justify private revenge. No, it’s no
      use arguing. I have made up my mind. My sympathies are with the
      criminals rather than with the victim, and I will not handle this
      case.”
