      “Hum! A doctor’s—general practitioner, I perceive,” said Holmes.
      “Not been long in practice, but has had a good deal to do. Come
      to consult us, I fancy! Lucky we came back!”       I was sufficiently conversant with Holmes’s methods to be able to
      follow his reasoning, and to see that the nature and state of the
      various medical instruments in the wicker basket which hung in
      the lamplight inside the brougham had given him the data for his
      swift deduction. The light in our window above showed that this
      late visit was indeed intended for us. With some curiosity as to
      what could have sent a brother medico to us at such an hour, I
      followed Holmes into our sanctum.
