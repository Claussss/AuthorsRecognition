"All right.  I'll come if I hear you bellow." "Stay here, then.  It may be a little time, but don't budge until I
come down." "I'm a fixture." Smith ascended the stairs, opened Bellingham's door and stepped in.
Bellingham was seated behind his table, writing.  Beside him, among his
litter of strange possessions, towered the mummy case, with its sale
number 249 still stuck upon its front, and its hideous occupant stiff
and stark within it.  Smith looked very deliberately round him, closed
the door, locked it, took the key from the inside, and then stepping
across to the fireplace, struck a match and set the fire alight.
Bellingham sat staring, with amazement and rage upon his bloated face.
