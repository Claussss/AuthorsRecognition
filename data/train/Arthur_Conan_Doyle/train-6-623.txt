They both listened together with sidelong heads. Then it rang clearly
forth once more, but this time in another direction. It had been on the
bow; now it was on the quarter. Again it sounded, and again. Now it had
moved to the other bow; now back to the quarter again; now it was near;
and now so far that it was but a faint tinkle on the ear. By this time
every man on board, seamen, archers and men-at-arms, were crowding the
sides of the vessel. All round them there were noises in the darkness,
and yet the wall of fog lay wet against their very faces. And the noises
were such as were strange to their ears, always the same high musical
clashing.
