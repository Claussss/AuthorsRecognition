There are two seasons of color in those parts: the yellow, when the
country-side is flaming with the gorse-blossoms, and the crimson, when
all the long slopes are smoldering with the heather. So it was now.
Nigel looked back from time to time, as he rode along the narrow track
where the ferns and the ling brushed his feet on either side, and as he
looked it seemed to him that wander where he might he would never see a
fairer scene than that of his own home. Far to the westward, glowing
in the morning light, rolled billow after billow of ruddy heather land,
until they merged into the dark shadows of Woolmer Forest and the pale
clear green of the Butser chalk downs. Never in his life had Nigel
wandered far beyond these limits, and the woodlands, the down and the
heather were dear to his soul. It gave him a pang in his heart now as
he turned his face away from them; but if home lay to the westward, out
there to the eastward was the great world of adventure, the noble stage
where each of his kinsmen in turn had played his manly part and left a
proud name behind.
