     "Now, I have a request to make, and I implore you by all that
     binds us together to fulfil it exactly as I tell you. There are
     some things which I do not wish to be seen by any one in my
     dark room--the room which I use for photographic purposes at
     the end of the garden passage. To prevent any painful thoughts,
     I may assure you once for all, dear, that it is nothing of
     which I need be ashamed. But still I do not wish you or Felix
     to enter that room. It is locked, and I implore you when you
     receive this to at once place a seal over the lock, and leave
     it so. Do not sell or let the house, for in either case my
     secret will be discovered. As long as you or Felix are in the
     house, I know that you will comply with my wishes. When Felix
     is twenty-one he may enter the room--not before.
