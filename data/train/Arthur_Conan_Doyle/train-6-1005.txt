But now there was a distant crash and a roar of “Saint George for
Guienne!” from behind. The Captal de Buch had charged home. “Saint
George for England!” yelled the main attack, and ever the counter-cry
came back to them from afar. The ranks opened in front of them. The
French were giving way. A small knight with golden scroll-work upon his
armor threw himself upon the Prince and was struck dead by his mace. It
was the Duke of Athens, Constable of France, but none had time to note
it, and the fight rolled on over his body. Looser still were the French
ranks. Many were turning their horses, for that ominous roar from
the rear had shaken their resolution. The little English wedge poured
onward, the Prince, Chandos, Audley and Nigel ever in the van.
