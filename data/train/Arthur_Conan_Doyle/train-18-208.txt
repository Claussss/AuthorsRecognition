and sister were under no physical restraint, but our powerlessness and
inability even to comprehend what the danger was which threatened those

maddening. Fifty times a day we asked ourselves and asked each other from what
possible quarter this peril was to be expected, but the more we thought
of it the more hopeless did any solution appear.
