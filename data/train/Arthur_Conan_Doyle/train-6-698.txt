In the south and east the Blois faction held the country, and Nantes
the capital was garrisoned and occupied by a strong French army. In the
north and west the Montfort party prevailed, for the island kingdom was
at their back and always fresh sails broke the northern sky-line bearing
adventurers from over the channel. Between these two there lay a broad zone comprising all the center
of the country which was a land of blood and violence, where no law
prevailed save that of the sword. From end to end it was dotted with
castles, some held for one side, some for the other, and many mere
robber strongholds, the scenes of gross and monstrous deeds, whose brute
owners, knowing that they could never be called to account, made war
upon all mankind, and wrung with rack and with flame the last shilling
from all who fell into their savage hands. The fields had long been
untilled. Commerce was dead. From Rennes in the east to Hennebon in the
west, and from Dinan in the north to Nantes in the south, there was no
spot where a man's life or a woman's honor was safe. Such was the land,
full of darkness and blood, the saddest, blackest spot in Christendom,
into which Knolles and his men were now advancing.
