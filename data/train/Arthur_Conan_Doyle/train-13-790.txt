      “Where shall I meet you?”       “At the station. The second first-class carriage from the front
      will be reserved for us.”       “The carriage is our rendezvous, then?”       “Yes.”       It was in vain that I asked Holmes to remain for the evening. It
      was evident to me that he thought he might bring trouble to the
      roof he was under, and that that was the motive which impelled
      him to go. With a few hurried words as to our plans for the
      morrow he rose and came out with me into the garden, clambering
      over the wall which leads into Mortimer Street, and immediately
      whistling for a hansom, in which I heard him drive away.
