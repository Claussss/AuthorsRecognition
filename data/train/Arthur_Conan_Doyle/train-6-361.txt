“A cete of badgers, fair sir.” “Good, Nigel--good, by my faith! And if you walk in Woolmer Forest and
see a swarm of foxes, how would you call it?” “A skulk of foxes.” “And if they be lions?” “Nay, fair sir, I am not like to meet several lions in Woolmer Forest.” “Aye, lad, but there are other forests besides Woolmer, and other lands
besides England, and who can tell how far afield such a knight errant
as Nigel of Tilford may go, when he sees worship to be won? We will say
that you were in the deserts of Nubia, and that afterward at the court
of the great Sultan you wished to say that you had seen several lions,
which is the first beast of the chase, being the king of all animals.
How then would you say it?”
