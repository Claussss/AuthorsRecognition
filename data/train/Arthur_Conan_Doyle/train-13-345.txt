      He dived his arm down to the bottom of the chest, and brought up
      a small wooden box with a sliding lid, such as children’s toys
      are kept in. From within he produced a crumpled piece of paper,
      an old-fashioned brass key, a peg of wood with a ball of string
      attached to it, and three rusty old disks of metal.       “Well, my boy, what do you make of this lot?” he asked, smiling
      at my expression.
