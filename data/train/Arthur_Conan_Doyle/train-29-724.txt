“You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson,” said he, “but you
remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning.” “Why, it is after nine now,” I answered. “I should not be surprised if
that were he. I thought I heard a ring.” It was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the change
which had come over him, for his face which was naturally of a broad
and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed
to me at least a shade whiter. He entered with a weariness and lethargy
which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before,
and he dropped heavily into the armchair which I pushed forward for
him.
