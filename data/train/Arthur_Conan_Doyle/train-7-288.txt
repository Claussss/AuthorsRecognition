Colonel Cochrane's camel was at one side, and the old soldier, whose
wrists had been freed, had been looking down upon the scene, and
wondering in his tenacious way whether all hope must really be
abandoned. It was evident that the Arabs who were grouped round the
victims were to remain behind with them, while the others who were
mounted would guard the three women and himself. He could not understand
why the throats of his companions had not been already cut, unless it
were that with an Eastern refinement of cruelty this rearguard would
wait until the Egyptians were close to them, so that the warm bodies of
their victims might be an insult to the pursuers. No doubt that was the
right explanation. The Colonel had heard of such a trick before.
