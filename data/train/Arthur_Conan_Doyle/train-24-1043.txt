need all our shafts ere we have done with them.” “Better to overshoot than to undershoot,” added Aylward. “Better to
strike the rear guard than to feather a shaft in the earth.” “Loose quick and sharp when they come,” added another. “Let it be the
eye to the string, the string to the shaft, and the shaft to the mark.
By Our Lady! their banners advance, and we must hold our ground now if
ever we are to see Southampton Water again.”
