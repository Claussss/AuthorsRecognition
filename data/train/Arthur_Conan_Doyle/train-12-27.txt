Suddenly his eye caught a dark figure emerging from the Avenue gates and
striding up the winding road. A few minutes brought him near enough to
show a familiar face looking over the stiff collar and from under the
soft black hat of an English clergyman. “Good-morning, Mr. Spurling.” “Ah, good-morning, Robert. How are you? Are you coming my way? How
slippery the roads are!” His round, kindly face was beaming with good nature, and he took little
jumps as he walked, like a man who can hardly contain himself for
pleasure.
