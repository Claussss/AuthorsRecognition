Now you see that whole row of books which takes you at one sweep
nearly across the shelf? I am rather proud of those, for they are
my collection of Napoleonic military memoirs. There is a story told
of an illiterate millionaire who gave a wholesale dealer an order
for a copy of all books in any language treating of any aspect of
Napoleon's career. He thought it would fill a case in his library.
He was somewhat taken aback, however, when in a few weeks he
received a message from the dealer that he had got 40,000 volumes,
and awaited instructions as to whether he should send them on as
an instalment, or wait for a complete set. The figures may not be
exact, but at least they bring home the impossibility of exhausting
the subject, and the danger of losing one's self for years in a huge
labyrinth of reading, which may end by leaving no very definite
impression upon your mind. But one might, perhaps, take a corner of
it, as I have done here in the military memoirs, and there one might
hope to get some finality.
