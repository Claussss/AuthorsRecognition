They are stories which invite criticism and yet defy it. The great
batsman at cricket is the man who can play an unorthodox game, take
every liberty which is denied to inferior players, and yet succeed
brilliantly in the face of his disregard of law. So it is here. I
should think the model of these stories is the most dangerous that
any young writer could follow. There is digression, that most deadly
fault in the short narrative; there is incoherence, there is want
of proportion which makes the story stand still for pages and bound
forward in a few sentences. But genius overrides all that, just as
the great cricketer hooks the off ball and glides the straight one
to leg. There is a dash, an exuberance, a full-blooded, confident
mastery which carries everything before it. Yes, no team of
immortals would be complete which did not contain at least two
representatives of Kipling.
