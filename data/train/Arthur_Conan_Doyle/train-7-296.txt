“Gippy Camel Corps!” cried the Colonel. “Two men,” said Miss Adams, in a voice of despair. “Only a vedette, ma'am! Throwing feelers out all over the desert. This
is one of them. Main body ten miles off, as likely as not. There they go
giving the alarm! Good old Camel Corps!” The self-contained, methodical soldier had suddenly turned almost
inarticulate with his excitement. There was a red flash upon the top of
the sand-hill, and then another, followed by the crack of the rifles.
Then with a whisk the two figures were gone, as swiftly and silently as
two trout in a stream.
