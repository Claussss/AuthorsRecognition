But his style! Ah, if Stevenson had only realized how beautiful and
nervous was his own natural God-given style, he would never have
been at pains to acquire another! It is sad to read the much-lauded
anecdote of his imitating this author and that, picking up and
dropping, in search of the best. The best is always the most
natural. When Stevenson becomes a conscious stylist, applauded by
so many critics, he seems to me like a man who, having most natural
curls, will still conceal them under a wig. The moment he is
precious he loses his grip. But when he will abide by his own
sterling Lowland Saxon, with the direct word and the short, cutting
sentence, I know not where in recent years we may find his mate. In
this strong, plain setting the occasional happy word shines like a
cut jewel. A really good stylist is like Beau Brummell's description
of a well-dressed man--so dressed that no one would ever observe
him. The moment you begin to remark a man's style the odds are that
there is something the matter with it. It is a clouding of the
crystal--a diversion of the reader's mind from the matter to the
manner, from the author's subject to the author himself.
