In front stood John Chandos in a party-colored jupon, one foot raised
upon the anchor-stock, picking at the strings of his guitar and singing
a song which he had learned at Marienburg when last he helped the
Teutonic knights against the heathen. The King, his knights, and even
the archers in the waist below them, laughed at the merry lilt and
joined lustily in the chorus, while the men of the neighboring ships
leaned over the side to hearken to the deep chant rolling over the
waters.
