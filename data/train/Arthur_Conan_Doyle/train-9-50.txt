There was a sudden rush and a scuffle, followed by the clash of iron
and a cry of pain. "You'll only get yourself hurt," said the inspector.  "Stand still,
will you?"  There was the click of the closing handcuffs. "A nice trap!" cried the high, snarling voice.  "It will bring YOU into
the dock, Holmes, not me.  He asked me to come here to cure him.  I was
sorry for him and I came.  Now he will pretend, no doubt, that I have
said anything which he may invent which will corroborate his insane
suspicions. You can lie as you like, Holmes.  My word is always as good
as yours."
