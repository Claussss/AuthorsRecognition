      “It depends on what the things were,” said Holmes. “You must
      remember that we are dealing with a burglar who is a very
      peculiar fellow, and who appears to work on lines of his own.
      Look, for example, at the queer lot of things which he took from
      Acton’s—what was it?—a ball of string, a letter-weight, and I
      don’t know what other odds and ends.”       “Well, we are quite in your hands, Mr. Holmes,” said old
      Cunningham. “Anything which you or the Inspector may suggest will
      most certainly be done.”
