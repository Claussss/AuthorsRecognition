The stranger laughed good-humoredly. “You can call me Thomas Lackland,”
 said he. “I should be Thomas Lack-brain if I were indeed to give my true
name, since a good many robbers, some in black gowns and some in steel,
would be glad to help me upwards in the way you speak of. So good-day
to you, Squire, and to you also, archer, and may you find your way back
with whole bones from the wars!” That night the comrades slept in Godstone Priory, and early next morning
they were well upon their road down the Pilgrim's Way. At Titsey it was
said that a band of villeins were out in Westerham Wood and had murdered
three men the day before; so that Nigel had high hopes of an encounter;
but the brigands showed no sign, though the travelers went out of their
way to ride their horses along the edges of the forest. Farther on they
found traces of their work, for the path ran along the hillside at the
base of a chalk quarry, and there in the cutting a man was lying dead.
From his twisted limbs and shattered frame it was easy to see that he
had been thrown over from above, while his pockets turned outward showed
the reason for his murder. The comrades rode past without too close
a survey, for dead men were no very uncommon objects on the King's
highway, and if sheriff or bailiff should chance upon you near the body
you might find yourself caught in the meshes of the law.
