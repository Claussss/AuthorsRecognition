He employed his creative faculty for about twenty years, which is
as much, I suppose, as Shakespeare did. The bard of Avon is another
example of the limited tenure which Genius has of life, though I
believe that he outlived the greater part of his own family, who
were not a healthy stock. He died, I should judge, of some nervous
disease; that is shown by the progressive degeneration of his
signature. Probably it was locomotor ataxy, which is the special
scourge of the imaginative man. Heine, Daudet, and how many more,
were its victims. As to the tradition, first mentioned long after
his death, that he died of a fever contracted from a drinking bout,
it is absurd on the face of it, since no such fever is known to
science. But a very moderate drinking bout would be extremely
likely to bring a chronic nervous complaint to a disastrous end.
