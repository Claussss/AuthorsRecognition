“If you leave me now,” whispered the woman, “then shame forever upon
your manhood.” “Surely, sir,” said Alleyne, speaking in as persuasive and soothing a
way as he could, “if your birth is gentle, there is the more reason that
your manners should be gentle too. I am well persuaded that you did but
jest with this lady, and that you will now permit her to leave your land
either alone or with me as a guide, if she should need one, through the
wood. As to birth, it does not become me to boast, and there is sooth in
what you say as to the unworthiness of clerks, but it is none the less
true that I am as well born as you.”
