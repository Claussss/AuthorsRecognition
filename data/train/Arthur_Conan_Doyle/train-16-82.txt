     "My poor father was a hard-working general practitioner in
     Birmingham, where his name is still remembered and respected.
     About ten years ago he began to show signs of mental
     aberration, which we were inclined to put down to overwork and
     the effects of a sunstroke. Feeling my own incompetence to
     pronounce upon a case of such importance, I at once sought the
     highest advice in Birmingham and London. Among others we
     consulted the eminent alienist, Mr. Fraser Brown, who
     pronounced my father's case to be intermittent in its nature,
     but dangerous during the paroxysms. 'It may take a homicidal,
     or it may take a religious turn,' he said; 'or it may prove to
     be a mixture of both. For months he may be as well as you or I,
     and then in a moment he may break out. You will incur a great
     responsibility if you leave him without supervision.'
