Three men riding together broke through the bushes which sheltered the
leaders of the archers, cut down Widdington the Dalesman, spurred onward
through the hedge, dashed over the bowmen behind it, and made for the
Prince. One fell with an arrow through his head, a second was beaten
from his saddle by Chandos, and the third was slain by the Prince's own
hand. A second band broke through near the river, but were cut off by
Lord Audley and his squires, so that all were slain. A single horseman
whose steed was mad with pain, an arrow in its eye and a second in its
nostril, sprang over the hedge and clattered through the whole army,
disappearing amid whoops and laughter into the woods behind. But none
others won as far as the hedge. The whole front of the position was
fringed with a litter of German wounded or dead, while one great heap in
the center marked the downfall of the gallant French three hundred.
