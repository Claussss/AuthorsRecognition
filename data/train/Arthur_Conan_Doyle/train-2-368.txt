“Take it back!” he cried, laying his hand on the breast of the
foremost. “Take it back this instant!” “What the devil do you mean? Once again I ask you, where is your
warrant?” shouted the furious Peters, his big red face glaring over the
farther end of the coffin. “The warrant is on its way. The coffin shall remain in the house until
it comes.” The authority in Holmes’s voice had its effect upon the bearers. Peters
had suddenly vanished into the house, and they obeyed these new orders.
“Quick, Watson, quick! Here is a screw-driver!” he shouted as the
coffin was replaced upon the table. “Here’s one for you, my man! A
sovereign if the lid comes off in a minute! Ask no questions—work away!
That’s good! Another! And another! Now pull all together! It’s giving!
It’s giving! Ah, that does it at last.”
