‘Then I am free!’ said I. ‘You are free,’ he answered. ‘There is your purchase-money upon the
table. You can go where you will, save only upon the land of England,
where you are still an outlaw under sentence.’ ‘How have you done this, Saxon?’ I asked. ‘Are you not afraid for
yourself?’ ‘Ho, ho!’ laughed the old soldier. ‘I am a free man, my lad! I hold my
pardon, and care not a maravedi for spy or informer. Who should I meet
but Colonel Kirke a day or so back. Yes, lad! I met him in the street,
and I cocked my hat in his face. The villain laid his hand upon his
hilt, and I should have out bilbo and sent his soul to hell had they not
come between us. I care not the ashes of this pipe for Jeffreys or any
other of them. I can snap this finger and thumb at them, so! They would
rather see Decimus Saxon’s back than his face, I promise ye!’
