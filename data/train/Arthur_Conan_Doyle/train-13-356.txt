      you can imagine that for a man like him it is not a very
      difficult part to play in a quiet country district. When he was
      married it was all right, but since he has been a widower we have
      had no end of trouble with him. A few months ago we were in hopes
      that he was about to settle down again for he became engaged to
      Rachel Howells, our second housemaid; but he has thrown her over
      since then and taken up with Janet Tregellis, the daughter of the
      head gamekeeper. Rachel—who is a very good girl, but of an
      excitable Welsh temperament—had a sharp touch of brain-fever, and
      goes about the house now—or did until yesterday—like a black-eyed
      shadow of her former self. That was our first drama at Hurlstone;
      but a second one came to drive it from our minds, and it was
      prefaced by the disgrace and dismissal of butler Brunton.
