So now you will understand, my dear Mr. McArdle, how this communication
reaches you, and you will also know the truth, in case you never hear

too depressed to make my plans.  To-morrow I must think out some way by
which I shall keep in touch with this camp, and yet search round for
any traces of my unhappy friends.
