An hour after sunrise the raiders called a halt, and food and water
were served out to all. Then at a more moderate pace they pursued
their southern journey, their long, straggling line trailing out over
a quarter of a mile of desert. From their more careless bearing and the
way in which they chatted as they rode, it was clear that they thought
that they had shaken off their pursuers. Their direction now was east
as well as south, and it was evidently their intention after this long
detour to strike the Nile again at some point far above the Egyptian
outposts. Already the character of the scenery was changing, and they
were losing the long levels of the pebbly desert, and coming once more
upon those fantastic, sunburned black rocks and that rich orange sand
through which they had already passed. On every side of them rose
the scaly, conical hills with their loose, slaglike _d√©bris_,
and jagged-edged khors, with sinuous streams of sand running like
watercourses down their centre. The camels followed each other, twisting
in and out among the boulders, and scrambling with their adhesive,
spongy feet over places which would have been impossible for horses.
Among the broken rocks those behind could sometimes only see the long,
undulating, darting necks of the creatures in front, as if it were some
nightmare procession of serpents. Indeed, it had much the effect of a
dream upon the prisoners, for there was no sound, save the soft, dull
padding and shuffling of the feet. The strange, wild frieze moved slowly
and silently onwards amid a setting of black stone and yellow sand, with
the one arch of vivid blue spanning the rugged edges of the ravine.
