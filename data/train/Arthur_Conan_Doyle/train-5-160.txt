"My dear sir, there can be no very pressing hurry in a first case.  We
shall have an all-night affair, I fancy.  You can't get an engine to go
without coals, Mr. Johnson, and I have had nothing but a light lunch." "We could have something cooked for you--something hot and a cup of
tea." "Thank you, but I fancy my dinner is actually on the table.  I can do
no good in the earlier stages.  Go home and say that I am coming, and I
will be round immediately afterwards."
