“A jambe gules erased,” said Sir Nigel, shaking his head solemnly. “Yet
it is not amiss for a monk-bred man. I trust that you are lowly and
serviceable?” “I have served all my life, my lord.” “Canst carve too?” “I have carved two days a week for the brethren.” “A model truly! Wilt make a squire of squires. But tell me, I pray,
canst curl hair?” “No, my lord, but I could learn.” “It is of import,” said he, “for I love to keep my hair well ordered,
seeing that the weight of my helmet for thirty years hath in some degree
frayed it upon the top.” He pulled off his velvet cap of maintenance as
he spoke, and displayed a pate which was as bald as an egg, and shone
bravely in the firelight. “You see,” said he, whisking round, and
showing one little strip where a line of scattered hairs, like the last
survivors in some fatal field, still barely held their own against the
fate which had fallen upon their comrades; “these locks need some little
oiling and curling, for I doubt not that if you look slantwise at my
head, when the light is good, you will yourself perceive that there are
places where the hair is sparse.”
