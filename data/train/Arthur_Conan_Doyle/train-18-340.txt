“He appeared to be more composed in the afternoon than I have seen him
for years, and spoke freely of his life in India and of the incidents of
his youth. About nine o'clock he requested us to go up to our own rooms,
and locked us in there--a precaution which he frequently took when the
dark fit was upon him. It was always his endeavour, poor soul, to keep
us clear of the curse which had fallen upon his own unfortunate head.
Before parting from us he tenderly embraced my mother and Gabriel,
and he afterwards followed me to my room, where he clasped my hand
affectionately and gave into my charge a small packet addressed to
yourself.”
