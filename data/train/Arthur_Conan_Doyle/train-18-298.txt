“No, no, that would never do,” he answered, shaking his head. “You will
learn about the wretched business soon enough. Mordaunt knows where to
lay his hand upon the papers bearing on the matter. You can consult him
about it to-morrow.” “But surely,” I cried, “if the peril is so imminent something may be
done to avert it. If you would but tell me what you fear I should know
how to act.” “My dear friend,” he said, “there is nothing to be done, so calm
yourself, and let things take their course. It has been folly on my part
to shelter myself behind mere barriers of wood and stone. The fact
is, that inaction was terrible to me, and I felt that to do anything,
however futile, in the nature of a precaution, was better than passive
resignation. My humble friend here and I have placed ourselves in a
position in which, I trust, no poor fellow will ever find himself
again. We can only recommend ourselves to the unfailing goodness of the
Almighty, and trust that what we have endured in this world may lessen
our atonement in the world to come. I must leave you now, for I have
many papers to destroy and much to arrange. Good-bye!”
