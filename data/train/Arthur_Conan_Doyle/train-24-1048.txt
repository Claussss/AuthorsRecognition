“And so say I!” shouted Sir Oliver, throwing his mace high into the air
and catching it again by the handle. “To your arms, men!” roared Sir Nigel. “Shoot while you may, and then
out sword, and let us live or die together!” CHAPTER XXXVII. HOW THE WHITE COMPANY CAME TO BE DISBANDED. 
Then up rose from the hill in the rugged Cantabrian valley a sound such
as had not been heard in those parts before, nor was again, until
the streams which rippled amid the rocks had been frozen by over four
hundred winters and thawed by as many returning springs. Deep and full
and strong it thundered down the ravine, the fierce battle-call of a
warrior race, the last stern welcome to whoso should join with them in
that world-old game where the stake is death. Thrice it swelled forth
and thrice it sank away, echoing and reverberating amidst the crags.
Then, with set faces, the Company rose up among the storm of stones,
and looked down upon the thousands who sped swiftly up the slope against
them. Horse and spear had been set aside, but on foot, with sword and
battle-axe, their broad shields slung in front of them, the chivalry of
Spain rushed to the attack.
