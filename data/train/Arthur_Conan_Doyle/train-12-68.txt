“It works very nicely,” said Raffles Haw. “It is quite a new thing--never
before done, as far as I know. You see the names of the various wines
and so on printed on the notes. By pressing the note down I complete an
electric circuit which causes the tap in the cellars beneath to remain
open long enough to fill the glass which always stands beneath it. The
glasses, you understand, stand upon a revolving drum, so that there must
always be one there. The glasses are then brought up through a pneumatic
tube, which is set working by the increased weight of the glass when the
wine is added to it. It is a pretty little idea. But I am afraid that I
bore you rather with all these petty contrivances. It is a whim of mine
to push mechanism as far as it will go.”
