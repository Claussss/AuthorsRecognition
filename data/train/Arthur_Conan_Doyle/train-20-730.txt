      “A most urgent telegram was dispatched to you from London by
      Godfrey Staunton at six-fifteen yesterday evening—a telegram
      which is undoubtedly associated with his disappearance—and yet
      you have not had it. It is most culpable. I shall certainly go
      down to the office here and register a complaint.”
