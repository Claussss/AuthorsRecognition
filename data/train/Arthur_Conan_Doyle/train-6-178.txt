So Chandos went his way that evening, walking his horse through the
peaceful lanes and twanging his citole as he went, for he loved music
and was famous for his merry songs. The cottagers came from their huts
and laughed and clapped as the rich full voice swelled and sank to the
cheery tinkling of the strings. There were few who saw him pass that
would have guessed that the quaint one-eyed man with the yellow hair was
the toughest fighter and craftiest man of war in Europe. Once only, as
he entered Farnham, an old broken man-at-arms ran out in his rags and
clutched at his horse as a dog gambols round his master. Chandos threw
him a kind word and a gold coin as he passed on to the castle.
