Finally there came the grim sacrist, with demure triumph upon his
downcast features, and at his heels Abbot John himself, slow and
dignified, with pompous walk and solemn, composed face, his iron-beaded
rosary swinging from his waist, his breviary in his hand, and his lips
muttering as he hurried through his office for the day. He knelt at his
high prie-dieu; the brethren, at a signal from the prior, prostrated
themselves upon the floor, and the low deep voices rolled in prayer,
echoed back from the arched and vaulted roof like the wash of waves from
an ocean cavern. Finally the monks resumed their seats; there entered
clerks in seemly black with pens and parchment; the red-velveted
summoner appeared to tell his tale; Nigel was led in with archers
pressing close around him; and then, with much calling of old French and
much legal incantation and mystery, the court of the Abbey was open for
business.
