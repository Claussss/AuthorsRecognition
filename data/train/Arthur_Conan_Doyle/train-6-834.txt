Like a pack of wolves they were on him, and he clanged upon the floor
with a dozen frenzied naked figures clutching and clinging above him.
In vain Nigel tried to pull them off. They were mad with rage, these
tortured starving men, their eyes fixed and glaring, their hair on end,
their teeth gnashing with fury, while they tore at the howling, writhing
man. Then with a rattle and clatter they pulled him across the room by
his two ankles and dragged him into the fire.
