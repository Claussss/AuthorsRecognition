“A sally, Du Guesclin, a sally!” cried Sir Nigel. “By Saint Paul! they
are in two minds, and a bold rush may turn them.” He drew his sword as
he spoke and darted down the winding stairs, closely followed by his
four comrades. Ere he was at the first floor, however, he threw up his
arms and stopped. “Mon Dieu!” he said, “we are lost men!” “What then?” cried those behind him. “The wall hath fallen in, the stair is blocked, and the fire still rages
below. By Saint Paul! friends, we have fought a very honorable fight,
and may say in all humbleness that we have done our devoir, but I think
that we may now go back to the Lady Tiphaine and say our orisons, for we
have played our parts in this world, and it is time that we made ready
for another.”
