I have said that I look upon Poe as the world's supreme short story
writer. His nearest rival, I should say, was Maupassant. The great
Norman never rose to the extreme force and originality of the
American, but he had a natural inherited power, an inborn instinct
towards the right way of making his effects, which mark him as a
great master. He produced stories because it was in him to do so, as
naturally and as perfectly as an apple tree produces apples. What a
fine, sensitive, artistic touch it is! How easily and delicately the
points are made! How clear and nervous is his style, and how free
from that redundancy which disfigures so much of our English work!
He pares it down to the quick all the time.
