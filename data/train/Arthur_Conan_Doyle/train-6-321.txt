“Nay, I have spoken. Lead him out!” But the trembling man clung to the King's knees in such a fashion that
the archers could not disengage his convulsive grip. “Listen to me a
moment, I implore you! Give me but one minute to plead with you, and
then do what you will.” The King leaned back in his chair. “Speak and have done,” said he. “You must spare me, my noble liege. For your own sake I say that you
must spare me, for I can set you in the way of such a knightly adventure
as will gladden your heart. Bethink you, sire, that this de Chargny and
his comrades know nothing of their plans having gone awry. If I do but
send them a message they will surely come to the postern gate. Then, if
we have placed our bushment with skill we shall have such a capture and
such a ransom as will fill your coffers. He and his comrades should be
worth a good hundred thousand crowns.”
