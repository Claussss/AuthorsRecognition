Nigel waited with Pommers under the shadow of the nunnery wall, horse
and man chafing with impatience, whilst above them six round-eyed
innocent nun-faces looked down on this strange and disturbing vision
from the outer world. At last the long column wound itself out of sight
round a curve of the road, and the white dot was gone from the bare
green flank of the hill. Nigel bowed his steel head to the nuns, gave
his bridle a shake, and bounded off upon his welcome mission. The
round-eyed sisters saw yellow horse and twinkling man sweep round the
skirt of the wood, caught a last glimmer of him through the tree-trunks,
and paced slowly back to their pruning and their planting, their minds
filled with the beauty and the terror of that outer world beyond the
high gray lichen-mottled wall.
