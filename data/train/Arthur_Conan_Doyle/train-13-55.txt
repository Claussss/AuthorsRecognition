      “I only wished to ask a question,” said Holmes, with his finger
      and thumb in his waistcoat pocket. “Should I be too early to see
      your master, Mr. Silas Brown, if I were to call at five o’clock
      to-morrow morning?”       “Bless you, sir, if any one is about he will be, for he is always
      the first stirring. But here he is, sir, to answer your questions
      for himself. No, sir, no; it is as much as my place is worth to
      let him see me touch your money. Afterwards, if you like.”
