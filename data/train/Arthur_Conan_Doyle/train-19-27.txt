Ten!  I associated the idea with Miss Penclosa's note.  It was lying
before me on the table, and I tore it open.  It was scribbled in pencil
in a peculiarly angular handwriting. "MY DEAR PROFESSOR GILROY [it said]:  Pray excuse the personal nature
of the test which I am giving you.  Professor Wilson happened to
mention the relations between you and my subject of this evening, and
it struck me that nothing could be more convincing to you than if I
were to suggest to Miss Marden that she should call upon you at
half-past nine to-morrow morning and suspend your engagement for half
an hour or so.  Science is so exacting that it is difficult to give a
satisfying test, but I am convinced that this at least will be an
action which she would be most unlikely to do of her own free will.
Forget any thing that she may have said, as she has really nothing
whatever to do with it, and will certainly not recollect any thing
about it.  I write this note to shorten your anxiety, and to beg you to
forgive me for the momentary unhappiness which my suggestion must have
caused you.
                "Yours faithfully;
                                "HELEN PENCLOSA.
