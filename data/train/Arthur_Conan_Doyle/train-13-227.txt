      “I want you, Mr. Hall Pycroft, to tell my friend your very
      interesting experience exactly as you have told it to me, or with
      more detail if possible. It will be of use to me to hear the
      succession of events again. It is a case, Watson, which may prove
      to have something in it, or may prove to have nothing, but which,
      at least, presents those unusual and _outré_ features which are
      as dear to you as they are to me. Now, Mr. Pycroft, I shall not
      interrupt you again.”
