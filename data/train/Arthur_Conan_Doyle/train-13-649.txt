      Your old schoolfellow,
      Percy Phelps.       There was something that touched me as I read this letter,
      something pitiable in the reiterated appeals to bring Holmes. So
      moved was I that even had it been a difficult matter I should
      have tried it, but of course I knew well that Holmes loved his
      art, so that he was ever as ready to bring his aid as his client
      could be to receive it. My wife agreed with me that not a moment
      should be lost in laying the matter before him, and so within an
      hour of breakfast-time I found myself back once more in the old
      rooms in Baker Street.
