‘Tell me, sirrah, have you ever known one Major Ogilvy of the Horse
Guards Blue?’ asked the Captain. ‘Seeing that I had the honour of taking him prisoner,’ I replied, ‘and
seeing also that he hath shared soldier’s fare and quarters with me ever
since, I think I may fairly say that I do know him.’ ‘Cast loose the cord!’ said the officer, and the hangman reluctantly
slipped the cord over my head once more. ‘Young man, you are surely
reserved for something great, for you will never be nearer your grave
until you do actually step into it. This Major Ogilvy hath made great
interest both for you and for a wounded comrade of yours who lies at
Bridgewater. Your name hath been given to the commanders of horse, with
orders to bring you in unscathed should you be taken. Yet it is but fair
to tell you that though the Major’s good word may save you from martial
law, it will stand you in small stead before a civil judge, before whom
ye must in the end take your trial.’
