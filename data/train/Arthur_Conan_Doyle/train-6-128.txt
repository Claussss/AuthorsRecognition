At this ignominious sentence by which the proud heir of the house of
Loring would share the fate of the meanest village poacher, the hot
blood of Nigel rushed to his face, and his eye glanced round him with
a gleam which said more plainly than words that there could be no tame
acceptance of such a doom. Twice he tried to speak, and twice his anger
and his shame held the words in his throat. “I am no subject of yours, proud Abbot!” he cried at last. “My house has
ever been vavasor to the King. I deny the power of you and your court to
lay sentence upon me. Punish these your own monks, who whimper at your
frown, but do not dare to lay your hand upon him who fears you not, for
he is a free man, and the peer of any save only the King himself.”
