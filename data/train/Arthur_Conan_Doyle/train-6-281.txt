“I had as soon take a peacock's feather, my fair lord; but I will do it,
if you ask me. Here, page, hand me one of those sticks, and let me see
what I can do.” But Sir Hubert de Burgh was not destined to test either his skill or his
luck. The great bay horse which he rode was as unused to this warlike
play as was its master, and had none of its master's stoutness of heart;
so that when it saw the leveled lance, the gleaming figure and the
frenzied yellow horse rushing down upon it, it swerved, turned and
galloped furiously down the river-bank. Amid roars of laughter from the
rustics on the one side and from the courtiers on the other, Sir Hubert
was seen, tugging vainly at his bridle, and bounding onward, clearing
gorse-bushes and heather-clumps, until he was but a shimmering,
quivering gleam upon the dark hillside. Nigel, who had pulled Pommers
on to his very haunches at the instant that his opponent turned, saluted
with his lance and trotted back to the bridge-head, where he awaited his
next assailant.
