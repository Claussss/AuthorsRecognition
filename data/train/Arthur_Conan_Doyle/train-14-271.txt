      The woman’s words came with an intense earnestness which carried
      conviction with them.       “Is this true, Barrymore?”       “Yes, Sir Henry. Every word of it.”       “Well, I cannot blame you for standing by your own wife. Forget
      what I have said. Go to your room, you two, and we shall talk
      further about this matter in the morning.”       When they were gone we looked out of the window again. Sir Henry
      had flung it open, and the cold night wind beat in upon our
      faces. Far away in the black distance there still glowed that one
      tiny point of yellow light.
