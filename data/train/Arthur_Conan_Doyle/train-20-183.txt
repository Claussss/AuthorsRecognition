      “I thought so,” said he, “the revolver had an ejector, and here
      is the third cartridge. I really think, Inspector Martin, that
      our case is almost complete.”       The country inspector’s face had shown his intense amazement at
      the rapid and masterful progress of Holmes’s investigation. At
      first he had shown some disposition to assert his own position,
      but now he was overcome with admiration, and ready to follow
      without question wherever Holmes led.
