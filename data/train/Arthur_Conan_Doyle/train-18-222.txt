“And how are our descendants to live, sir,” I asked, with a smile,
“during the progress of this great undertaking:” “That's the worst of you, Jack,” my father cried petulantly. “There is
nothing practical about you. Instead of confining your attention to the
working out of my noble scheme, you begin raising all sorts of absurd
objections. It is a mere matter of detail how our descendants live, so
long as they stick to the Djarmas. Now, I want you to go up to the bothy
of Fergus McDonald and see about the thatch, and Willie Fullerton has
written to say that his milk-cow is bad. You might took in upon your way
and ask after it.”
