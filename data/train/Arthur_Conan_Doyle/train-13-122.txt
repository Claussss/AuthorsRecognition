      “Is Miss Cushing at home?” asked Holmes.       “Miss Sarah Cushing is extremely ill,” said he. “She has been
      suffering since yesterday from brain symptoms of great severity.
      As her medical adviser, I cannot possibly take the responsibility
      of allowing anyone to see her. I should recommend you to call
      again in ten days.” He drew on his gloves, closed the door, and
      marched off down the street.
