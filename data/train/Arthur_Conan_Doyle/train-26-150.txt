We have left our eighteenth-century novelists--Fielding, Richardson,
and Smollett--safely behind us, with all their solidity and their
audacity, their sincerity, and their coarseness of fibre. They have
brought us, as you perceive, to the end of the shelf. What, not
wearied? Ready for yet another? Let us run down this next row, then,
and I will tell you a few things which may be of interest, though
they will be dull enough if you have not been born with that love of
books in your heart which is among the choicest gifts of the gods.
If that is wanting, then one might as well play music to the deaf,
or walk round the Academy with the colour-blind, as appeal to the
book-sense of an unfortunate who has it not.
