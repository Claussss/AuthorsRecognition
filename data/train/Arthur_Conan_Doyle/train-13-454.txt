      “The remainder of the sheet!” cried the Inspector.       “Precisely.”       “And where was it?”       “Where I was sure it must be. I’ll make the whole matter clear to
      you presently. I think, Colonel, that you and Watson might return
      now, and I will be with you again in an hour at the furthest. The
      Inspector and I must have a word with the prisoners, but you will
      certainly see me back at luncheon time.”
