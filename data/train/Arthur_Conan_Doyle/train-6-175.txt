“I thank you, noble sir, and if I should turn to anyone it would indeed
be to you; but there are other ways which I would try first. But I pray
you, good Sir John, to tell me of some of your noble spear-runnings
against the French, for the whole land rings with the tale of your deeds
and I have heard that in one morning three champions have fallen before
your lance. Was it not so?” “That it was indeed so these scars upon my body will prove; but these
were the follies of my youth.”
