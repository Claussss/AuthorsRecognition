“Mehemet Ali has agreed,” said he. “He has gone to put the nose-rope
upon three more of the camels. But it is foolishness, and we are all
going to our death. Now come with me, and we shall awaken the women and
tell them.” The Colonel shook his companions and whispered to them what was in the
wind. Belmont and Fardet were ready for any risk. Stephens, to whom the
prospect of a passive death presented little terror, was seized with a
convulsion of fear when he thought of any active exertion to avoid
it, and shivered in all his long, thin limbs. Then he pulled out his
Baedeker and began to write his will upon the fly-leaf, but his hand
twitched so that he was hardly legible. By some strange gymnastic of the
legal mind, a death, even by violence, if accepted quietly, had a place
in the established order of things, while a death which overtook
one galloping frantically over a desert was wholly irregular and
discomposing. It was not dissolution which he feared, but the
humiliation and agony of a fruitless struggle against it.
