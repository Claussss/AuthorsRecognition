“Have you ever known a wreck in these parts?” I asked. “Lord love ye, sir, it's a famous place for wrecks. Why, in that very
bay down there two o' King Philip's first-rates foundered wi' all hands
in the days o' the Spanish war. If that sheet o' water and the Bay o'
Luce round the corner could tell their ain tale they'd have a gey lot
to speak of. When the Jedgment Day comes round that water will be
just bubbling wi' the number o' folks that will be coming up frae the
bottom.”
