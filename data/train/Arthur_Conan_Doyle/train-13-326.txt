      “‘“Right between my finger and thumb,” he cried. “By God! I’ve
      got more pounds to my name than you’ve hairs on your head. And if
      you’ve money, my son, and know how to handle it and spread it,
      you can do _anything!_ Now, you don’t think it likely that a man
      who could do anything is going to wear his breeches out sitting
      in the stinking hold of a rat-gutted, beetle-ridden, mouldy old
      coffin of a China coaster. No, sir, such a man will look after
      himself and will look after his chums. You may lay to that! You
      hold on to him, and you may kiss the book that he’ll haul you
      through.”
