Here is Marbot at this end--the first of all soldier books in the
world. This is the complete three-volume French edition, with red
and gold cover, smart and debonnaire like its author. Here he is
in one frontispiece with his pleasant, round, boyish face, as a
Captain of his beloved Chasseurs. And here in the other is the
grizzled old bull-dog as a full general, looking as full of fight as
ever. It was a real blow to me when some one began to throw doubts
upon the authenticity of Marbot's memoirs. Homer may be dissolved
into a crowd of skin-clad bards. Even Shakespeare may be jostled
in his throne of honour by plausible Baconians; but the human, the
gallant, the inimitable Marbot! His book is that which gives us the
best picture by far of the Napoleonic soldiers, and to me they are
even more interesting than their great leader, though his must ever
be the most singular figure in history. But those soldiers, with
their huge shakoes, their hairy knapsacks, and their hearts of
steel--what men they were! And what a latent power there must be
in this French nation which could go on pouring out the blood of
its sons for twenty-three years with hardly a pause!
