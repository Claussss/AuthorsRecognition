“Curse them! they have had the best of us!” he cried. “I can do no more.
Sir John has lost his papers, for indeed now that night is at hand I can
see no way in which we can gain them.” Nigel had leaned against the bulwark during these events, watching with
keen attention the doings of the sailors, and praying alternately to
Saint Paul, Saint George, and Saint Thomas for a slant of wind which
would put them along side their enemy. He was silent; but his hot heart
was simmering within him. His spirit had risen even above the discomfort
of the sea, and his mind was too absorbed in his mission to have a
thought for that which had laid Aylward flat upon the deck. He had never
doubted that Cock Badding in one way or another would accomplish his
end, but when he heard his speech of despair he bounded off the bulwark
and stood before the seaman with his face flushed and all his soul
afire.
