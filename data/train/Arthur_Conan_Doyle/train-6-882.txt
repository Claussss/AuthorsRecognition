The Breton leader had marshaled his men in a line opposite to the
English, and now he strode forward and shook Bambro' by the hand. “By
Saint Cadoc! this is a very joyous meeting, Richard,” said he, “and we
have certainly hit upon a very excellent way of keeping a truce.” “Indeed, Robert,” said Bambro', “we owe you much thanks, for I can see
that you have been at great pains to bring a worthy company against us
this day. Surely if all should chance to perish there will be few noble
houses in Brittany who will not mourn.”
