      “‘Don’t be disheartened, Mr. Pycroft,’ said my new acquaintance,
      seeing the length of my face. ‘Rome was not built in a day, and
      we have lots of money at our backs, though we don’t cut much dash
      yet in offices. Pray sit down, and let me have your letter.’       “I gave it to him, and he read it over very carefully.       “‘You seem to have made a vast impression upon my brother
      Arthur,’ said he; ‘and I know that he is a pretty shrewd judge.
      He swears by London, you know; and I by Birmingham; but this time
      I shall follow his advice. Pray consider yourself definitely
      engaged.’
