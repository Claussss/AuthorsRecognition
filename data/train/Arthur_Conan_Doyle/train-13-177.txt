      “I don’t know what there was about that face, Mr. Holmes, but it
      seemed to send a chill right down my back. I was some little way
      off, so that I could not make out the features, but there was
      something unnatural and inhuman about the face. That was the
      impression that I had, and I moved quickly forwards to get a
      nearer view of the person who was watching me. But as I did so
      the face suddenly disappeared, so suddenly that it seemed to have
      been plucked away into the darkness of the room. I stood for five
      minutes thinking the business over, and trying to analyze my
      impressions. I could not tell if the face were that of a man or a
      woman. It had been too far from me for that. But its colour was
      what had impressed me most. It was of a livid chalky white, and
      with something set and rigid about it which was shockingly
      unnatural. So disturbed was I that I determined to see a little
      more of the new inmates of the cottage. I approached and knocked
      at the door, which was instantly opened by a tall, gaunt woman
      with a harsh, forbidding face.
