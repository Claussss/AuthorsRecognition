The knight errant, whose mind had been filled by the thought of the
maiden whom he had left behind at St. Jean--the same whose glove dangled
from his helmet--had observed nothing that had occurred. Hence, all that
met his eyes was a noble yellow horse, which was tethered by the
track, and a small young man, who appeared to be a lunatic since he
had undressed hastily in the heart of the forest, and stood now with an
eager anxious face clad in his underlinen amid the scattered debris
of his garments. Of such a person the high Lord of Pons could take no
notice, and so he pursued his inexorable way, his arrogant eyes looking
out into the distance and his thoughts set intently upon the maiden of
St. Jean. He was dimly aware that the little crazy man in the undershirt
ran a long way beside him in his stockings, begging, imploring and
arguing.
