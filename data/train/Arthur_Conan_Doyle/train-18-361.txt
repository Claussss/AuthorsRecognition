There is no need for me to enter into the wretched business again, or
to detail at any length the events of October 5th, 1841, and the various
circumstances which led up to the death of Ghoolab Shah, the arch adept. I have torn a sheaf of leaves from my old journal, in which you will
find a bald account of the matter, and an independent narrative was
furnished by Sir Edward Elliott, of the Artillery, to the Star of India
some years ago--in which, however, the names were suppressed.
