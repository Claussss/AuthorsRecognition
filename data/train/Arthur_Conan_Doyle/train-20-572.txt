      “Excellent!” said Holmes, who was recovering his good-humour as
      his attention became more engrossed by the case. “Fortune has
      been your friend.”       “This was not all. I have a new writing-table with a fine surface
      of red leather. I am prepared to swear, and so is Bannister, that
      it was smooth and unstained. Now I found a clean cut in it about
      three inches long—not a mere scratch, but a positive cut. Not
      only this, but on the table I found a small ball of black dough
      or clay, with specks of something which looks like sawdust in it.
      I am convinced that these marks were left by the man who rifled
      the papers. There were no footmarks and no other evidence as to
      his identity. I was at my wits’ end, when suddenly the happy
      thought occurred to me that you were in the town, and I came
      straight round to put the matter into your hands. Do help me, Mr.
      Holmes. You see my dilemma. Either I must find the man or else
      the examination must be postponed until fresh papers are
      prepared, and since this cannot be done without explanation,
      there will ensue a hideous scandal, which will throw a cloud not
      only on the college, but on the university. Above all things, I
      desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly.”
