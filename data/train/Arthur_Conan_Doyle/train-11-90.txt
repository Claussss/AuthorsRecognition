volunteered for a service of great danger, but the exact details have
not yet been given to me.” “Colonel Perrin,” said Lannes, severely, “it is unfair to allow this
brave officer to volunteer before he has learned what the perils are to
which he will be exposed.” But already I was myself once more. “Sir,” said I, “permit me to remark that the greater the danger the
greater the glory, and that I could only repent of volunteering if I
found that there were no risks to be run.”
