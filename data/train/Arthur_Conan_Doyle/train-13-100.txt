      “So much for the _Daily Chronicle_,” said Holmes as I finished
      reading. “Now for our friend Lestrade. I had a note from him this
      morning, in which he says: ‘I think that this case is very much
      in your line. We have every hope of clearing the matter up, but
      we find a little difficulty in getting anything to work upon. We
      have, of course, wired to the Belfast post-office, but a large
      number of parcels were handed in upon that day, and they have no
      means of identifying this particular one, or of remembering the
      sender. The box is a half-pound box of honeydew tobacco and does
      not help us in any way. The medical student theory still appears
      to me to be the most feasible, but if you should have a few hours
      to spare I should be very happy to see you out here. I shall be
      either at the house or in the police-station all day.’ What say
      you, Watson? Can you rise superior to the heat and run down to
      Croydon with me on the off chance of a case for your annals?”
