“I should indeed love to look upon them,” Alleyne answered; “but I have
come from Beaulieu for a purpose, and I must be true to my service, even
as thou art true to thine.” “Bethink you again, mon ami,” quoth Aylward, “that you might do much
good yonder, since there are three hundred men in the Company, and none
who has ever a word of grace for them, and yet the Virgin knows that
there was never a set of men who were in more need of it. Sickerly the
one duty may balance the other. Your brother hath done without you this
many a year, and, as I gather, he hath never walked as far as Beaulieu
to see you during all that time, so he cannot be in any great need of
you.”
