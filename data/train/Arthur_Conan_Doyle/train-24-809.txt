“By the Virgin! when he learns that you have come to draw away these
rascals he will be very blithe to look upon your face. Inn-keeper, here
are ten gold pieces. What is over and above your reckoning you may take
off from your charges to the next needy knight who comes this way. Come
then, for it grows late and the horses are stamping in the roadway.” The Lady Tiphaine and her spouse sprang upon their steeds without
setting feet to stirrup, and away they jingled down the white moonlit
highway, with Sir Nigel at the lady's bridle-arm, and Ford a spear's
length behind them. Alleyne had lingered for an instant in the passage,
and as he did so there came a wild outcry from a chamber upon the
left, and out there ran Aylward and John, laughing together like two
schoolboys who are bent upon a prank. At sight of Alleyne they slunk
past him with somewhat of a shame-faced air, and springing upon their
horses galloped after their party. The hubbub within the chamber did not
cease, however, but rather increased, with yells of: “A moi, mes amis! A
moi, camarades! A moi, l'honorable champion de l'Eveque de Montaubon! A
la recousse de l'eglise sainte!” So shrill was the outcry that both the
inn-keeper and Alleyne, with every varlet within hearing, rushed wildly
to the scene of the uproar.
