Although our modern manifestations have never attained the power
mentioned in the Biblical records, they present some features which are
not related in the New Testament.  Clairaudience, that is the hearing
of a spirit voice, is common to both, but the direct voice, that is the
hearing of a voice which all can discern with their material ears, is a
well-authenticated phenomenon now which is more rarely mentioned of
old.  So, too, Spirit-photography, where the camera records what the
human eye cannot see, is necessarily a new testimony.  Nothing is
evidence to those who do not examine evidence, but I can attest most
solemnly that I personally know of several cases where the image upon
the plate after death has not only been unmistakable, but also has
differed entirely from any pre-existing photograph.
