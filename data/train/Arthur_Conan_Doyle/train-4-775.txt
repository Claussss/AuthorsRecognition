‘Look there!’ quoth he, holding down his lanthorn so as to cast its
light on the part of the floor where the panel was fitted. Can you not
see how old and crumbled is the stone-work which surrounds it? This
opening in the roof is as old as the dungeon itself, and older far
than the door by which you were led into it. For this was one of those
bottle-shaped cells or oubliettes which hard men of old devised for the
safe keeping of their captives. Once lowered through this hole into the
stone-girt pit a man might eat his heart out, for his fate was sealed.
Yet you see that the very device which once hindered escape has now
brought freedom within your reach.’
