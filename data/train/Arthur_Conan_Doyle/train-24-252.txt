“Nor can I marvel at that,” said she, with a little tinkling laugh. “You
came in as the knight does in the jongleur's romances, between dragon
and damsel, with small time for the asking of questions. Come,” she went
on, springing to her feet, and smoothing down her rumpled frock, “let us
walk through the shaw together, and we may come upon Bertrand with the
horses. If poor Troubadour had not cast a shoe, we should not have had
this trouble. Nay, I must have your arm: for, though I speak lightly,
now that all is happily over I am as frightened as my brave Roland. See
how his chest heaves, and his dear feathers all awry--the little knight
who would not have his lady mishandled.” So she prattled on to her hawk,
while Alleyne walked by her side, stealing a glance from time to time at
this queenly and wayward woman. In silence they wandered together over
the velvet turf and on through the broad Minstead woods, where the
old lichen-draped beeches threw their circles of black shadow upon the
sunlit sward.
