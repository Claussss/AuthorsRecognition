“But your appearance, Holmes—your ghastly face?” “Three days of absolute fast does not improve one’s beauty, Watson. For
the rest, there is nothing which a sponge may not cure. With vaseline
upon one’s forehead, belladonna in one’s eyes, rouge over the
cheek-bones, and crusts of beeswax round one’s lips, a very satisfying
effect can be produced. Malingering is a subject upon which I have
sometimes thought of writing a monograph. A little occasional talk
about half-crowns, oysters, or any other extraneous subject produces a
pleasing effect of delirium.”
