me,” said he. “It is true, Nigel. I have indeed watched over you as the gardener
watches his most precious blossom, for in you alone are all the hopes of
our ancient house, and soon--very soon--you will be alone.” “Nay, dear lady, say not that.” “I am very old, Nigel, and I feel the shadow closing in upon me. My
heart yearns to go, for all whom I have known and loved have gone before
me. And you--it will be a blessed day for you, since I have held you
back from that world into which your brave spirit longs to plunge.”
