“Saint George! Saint George! A Knolles to the rescue!” A small craft
had run alongside and sixty men had swarmed on the deck of the St. Iago.
Caught between two fires, the Spaniards wavered and broke. The fight
became a massacre. Down from the poop sprang the Prince's men. Up from
the waist rushed the new-corners. There were five dreadful minutes of
blows and screams and prayers with struggling figures clinging to the
bulwarks and sullen splashes into the water below. Then it was over, and
a crowd of weary, overstrained men leaned panting upon their weapons, or
lay breathless and exhausted upon the deck of the captured carack.
