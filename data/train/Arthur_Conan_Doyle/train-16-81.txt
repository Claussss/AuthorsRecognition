     "KIRKBY LUNATIC ASYLUM,      "_September 4th_, 1885.      "SIR,--I am deeply conscious that some apology and explanation
     is due to you for the very startling and, in your eyes,
     mysterious events which have recently occurred, and which have
     so seriously interfered with the retired existence which you
     desire to lead. I should have called upon you on the morning
     after the recapture of my father, but my knowledge of your
     dislike to visitors and also of--you will excuse my saying
     it--your very violent temper, led me to think that it was
     better to communicate with you by letter.
