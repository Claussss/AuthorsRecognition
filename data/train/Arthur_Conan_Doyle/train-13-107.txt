      “It is very neatly tied. I had already made a note to that
      effect,” said Lestrade complacently.       “So much for the string, then,” said Holmes, smiling, “now for
      the box wrapper. Brown paper, with a distinct smell of coffee.
      What, did you not observe it? I think there can be no doubt of
      it. Address printed in rather straggling characters: ‘Miss S.
      Cushing, Cross Street, Croydon.’ Done with a broad-pointed pen,
      probably a J, and with very inferior ink. The word ‘Croydon’ has
      been originally spelled with an ‘i,’ which has been changed to
      ‘y.’ The parcel was directed, then, by a man—the printing is
      distinctly masculine—of limited education and unacquainted with
      the town of Croydon. So far, so good! The box is a yellow
      half-pound honeydew box, with nothing distinctive save two thumb
      marks at the left bottom corner. It is filled with rough salt of
      the quality used for preserving hides and other of the coarser
      commercial purposes. And embedded in it are these very singular
      enclosures.”
