“I'm the first to admit that,” said the detective heartily. “You get to
your point, I admit; but you have such a deuced round-the-corner way of
doing it.” “Well, well, I'll drop past history and get down to present-day facts. I
called last night, as I have already said, at the Manor House. I did not
see either Barker or Mrs. Douglas. I saw no necessity to disturb them;
but I was pleased to hear that the lady was not visibly pining and that
she had partaken of an excellent dinner. My visit was specially made
to the good Mr. Ames, with whom I exchanged some amiabilities, which
culminated in his allowing me, without reference to anyone else, to sit
alone for a time in the study.”
