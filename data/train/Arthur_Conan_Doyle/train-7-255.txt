their countrymen. It was a sinful, human, un-Christian motive, and yet
it was about to make them public martyrs to the Christian creed. In
the hush and tension of their nerves low sounds grew suddenly loud

a swift-flowing river, and far away they could hear the dull, soft
thudding of a galloping camel.
