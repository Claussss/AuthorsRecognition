do must be to-morrow; for we must lie low until the Pinkerton affair
is settled up. We can't afford to set the police buzzing, to-day of all

himself where he got his news if we have to cut his heart out first. Did
he seem to scent a trap?” McMurdo laughed. “I guess I took him on his weak point,” he said. “If he
could get on a good trail of the Scowrers, he's ready to follow it into
hell. I took his money,” McMurdo grinned as he produced a wad of dollar
notes, “and as much more when he has seen all my papers.”
