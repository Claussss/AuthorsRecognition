      It may be remembered that after my marriage, and my subsequent
      start in private practice, the very intimate relations which had
      existed between Holmes and myself became to some extent modified.
      He still came to me from time to time when he desired a companion
      in his investigation, but these occasions grew more and more
      seldom, until I find that in the year 1890 there were only three
      cases of which I retain any record. During the winter of that
      year and the early spring of 1891, I saw in the papers that he
      had been engaged by the French government upon a matter of
      supreme importance, and I received two notes from Holmes, dated
      from Narbonne and from Nimes, from which I gathered that his stay
      in France was likely to be a long one. It was with some surprise,
      therefore, that I saw him walk into my consulting-room upon the
      evening of the 24th of April. It struck me that he was looking
      even paler and thinner than usual.
