and dear lord, how many years I have served under your banners and how
many services I have rendered. Was it not I who found the ford upon the
Seine two days before the great battle? Was it not I also who marshaled
the attack at the intaking of Calais? I have a wife and four children in
Italy, great King; and it was the thought of them which led me to fall
from my duty, for this money would have allowed me to leave the wars and
to see them once again. Mercy, my liege, mercy, I implore!”
