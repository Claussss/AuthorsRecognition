The sacrist leaned forward with the face of one who bears tidings of
woe. “There are pike in the Abbot's pond,” said he. “Pike!” cried the Abbot in horror. “As well shut up a wolf in our
sheepfold. How came a pike in the pond? There were no pike last year,
and a pike does not fall with the rain nor rise in the springs. The pond
must be drained, or we shall spend next Lent upon stockfish, and have
the brethren down with the great sickness ere Easter Sunday has come to
absolve us from our abstinence.”
