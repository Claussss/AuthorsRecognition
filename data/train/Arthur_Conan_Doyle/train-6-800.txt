What would Knolles say in case they failed? The thought flashed through
Nigel's mind, but another came swiftly behind it. He would not venture

he would put his life upon it. Giving that, he made amends for all
errors. And if on the other hand success crowned their efforts, then
Knolles would forgive his failure at the gateway. A minute later, every
doubt banished from his mind, he was making his way through the darkness
under the guidance of Black Simon.
