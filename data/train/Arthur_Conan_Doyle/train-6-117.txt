It was the sacrist who first advanced to the oaken desk reserved for the
witnesses and expounded in hard, dry, mechanical fashion the many claims
which the House, of Waverley had against the family of Loring. Some
generations back in return for money advanced or for spiritual favor
received the Loring of the day had admitted that his estate had certain
feudal duties toward the Abbey. The sacrist held up the crackling yellow
parchment with swinging leaden seals on which the claim was based. Amid
the obligations was that of escuage, by which the price of a knight's
fee should be paid every year. No such price had been paid, nor had any
service been done. The accumulated years came now to a greater sum than
the fee simple of the estate. There were other claims also. The sacrist
called for his books, and with thin, eager forefinger he tracked them
down: dues for this, and tailage for that, so many shillings this year,
and so many marks that one. Some of it occurred before Nigel was born;
some of it when he was but a child. The accounts had been checked and
certified by the sergeant of the law.
