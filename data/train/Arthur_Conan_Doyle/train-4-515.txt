As Saxon was firm in this resolution the Mayor forbore to press it upon
him, but my two friends gladly joined with me in accepting the worthy
wool-worker’s offer, and took up our quarters for the time under his
hospitable roof. Chapter XIX. Of a Brawl in the Night Decimus Saxon refused to avail himself of Master Timewell’s house and
table for the reason, as I afterwards learned, that, the Mayor being a
firm Presbyterian, he thought it might stand him in ill stead with the
Independents and other zealots were he to allow too great an intimacy
to spring up between them. Indeed, my dears, from this time onward this
cunning man framed his whole life and actions in such a way as to make
friends of the sectaries, and to cause them to look upon him as their
leader. For he had a firm belief that in all such outbreaks as that in
which we were engaged, the most extreme party is sure in the end to gain
the upper hand. ‘Fanatics,’ he said to me one day, ‘mean fervour, and
fervour means hard work, and hard work means power.’ That was the centre
point of all his plotting and scheming.
