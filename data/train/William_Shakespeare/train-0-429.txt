THIRD SERVINGMAN O, this it is that makes your lady mourn. SECOND SERVINGMAN O, this is it that makes your servants droop. Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,
As beaten hence by your strange lunacy.
O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth.
Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment,
And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.
Look how thy servants do attend on thee,
Each in his office, ready at thy beck.
Wilt thou have music?
