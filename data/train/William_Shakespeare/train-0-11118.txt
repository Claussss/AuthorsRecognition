GIACOMO Would I had put my estate and my neighbour’s on th’approbation of what I have spoke. POSTHUMUS What lady would you choose to assail? GIACOMO Yours, whom in constancy you think stands so safe. I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring that, commend me to the court where your lady is, with no more advantage than the opportunity of a second conference, and I will bring from thence that honour of hers which you imagine so reserved.
