Why, that to know which else we should not know. Things hid and barred, you mean, from common sense. Ay, that is study’s god-like recompense. Come on, then, I will swear to study so
To know the thing I am forbid to know,
As thus: to study where I well may dine
When I to feast expressly am forbid,
Or study where to meet some mistress fine
When mistresses from common sense are hid;
Or having sworn too hard a keeping oath,
Study to break it and not break my troth.
If study’s gain be thus, and this be so,
Study knows that which yet it doth not know.
Swear me to this, and I will ne’er say no.
