Nay, bear three daughters—by your leave I speak it—
You love the breeder better than the male. Enter one blowing But what art thou whose heavy looks foretell
Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue? Ah, one that was a woeful looker-on
Whenas the noble Duke of York was slain—
Your princely father and my loving lord.
