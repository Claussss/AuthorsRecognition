The Comical History of the Merchant of Venice, or Otherwise Called the Jew of Venice 1.1
Enter Antonio, Salerio, and Solanio In sooth, I know not why I am so sad.
It wearies me, you say it wearies you,
But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,
What stuff â€™tis made of, whereof it is born,
I am to learn;
And such a want-wit sadness makes of me
That I have much ado to know myself.
