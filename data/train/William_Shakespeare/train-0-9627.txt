FIRST LORD DUMAINE We shall, noble captain. PAROLES Mars dote on you for his novices. Exeunt both Lords Dumaine (To Bertram) What will ye do? BERTRAM Stay the King. PAROLES Use a more spacious ceremony to the noble lords. You have restrained yourself within the list of too cold an adieu. Be more expressive to them, for they wear themselves in the cap of the time, there do muster true gait; eat, speak, and move under the influence of the most received starâ€”and though the devil lead the measure, such are to be followed. After them, and take a more dilated farewell.
