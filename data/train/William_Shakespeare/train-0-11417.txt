O the heavens! What foul play had we that we came from thence?
Or blessed was’t we did? Both, both, my girl. By foul play, as thou sayst, were we heaved thence,
But blessedly holp hither. O, my heart bleeds To think o’th’ teen that I have turned you to,
Which is from my remembrance. Please you, farther.
