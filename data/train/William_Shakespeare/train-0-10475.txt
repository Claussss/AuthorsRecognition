FIRST LORD Bear from hence his body, And mourn you for him. Let him be regarded
As the most noble corpse that ever herald
Did follow to his urn. SECOND LORD His own impatience Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame.
Let’s make the best of it. My rage is gone, And I am struck with sorrow. Take him up.
Help three o’th’ chiefest soldiers; I’ll be one.
Beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully.
Trail your steel pikes. Though in this city he
Hath widowed and unchilded many a one,
Which to this hour bewail the injury,
Yet he shall have a noble memory. Assist.
