Which all this time hath overslipped her thought
That she with painted images hath spent,
Being from the feeling of her own grief brought
By deep surmise of othersâ€™ detriment,
Losing her woes in shows of discontent. It easeth some, though none it ever cured,
To think their dolour others have endured.
