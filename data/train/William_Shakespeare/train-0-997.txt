Exit attendant Enter the Earls of Warwick and Salisbury with a drummer and soldiers Are these thy bears? We’ll bait thy bears to death,
And manacle the bearherd in their chains,
If thou dar’st bring them to the baiting place. Oft have I seen a hot o’erweening cur
Run back and bite, because he was withheld;
Who, being suffered with the bear’s fell paw,
Hath clapped his tail between his legs and cried;
And such a piece of service will you do,
If you oppose yourselves to match Lord Warwick.
