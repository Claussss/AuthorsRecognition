By sea—what else? Why will my lord do so? For that he dares us to’t. So hath my lord dared him to single fight. Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia,
Where Caesar fought with Pompey. But these offers
Which serve not for his vantage, he shakes off,
And so should you. Your ships are not well manned, Your mariners are muleters, reapers, people 35
Engrossed by swift impress. In Caesar’s fleet
Are those that often have ’gainst Pompey fought.
Their ships are yare, yours heavy. No disgrace
Shall fall you for refusing him at sea,
Being prepared for land.
