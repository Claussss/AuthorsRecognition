QUEEN ELIZABETH If he were dead, what would betide on me? No other harm but loss of such a lord. QUEEN ELIZABETH The loss of such a lord includes all harms. The heavens have blessed you with a goodly son
To be your comforter when he is gone. QUEEN ELIZABETH Ah, he is young, and his minority
Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,
A man that loves not meâ€”nor none of you.
