A twelvemonth? Well, befall what will befall,
I’ll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital. QUEEN (to the King) Ay, sweet my lord, and so I take my leave. No, madam, we will bring you on your way. Our wooing doth not end like an old play.
Jack hath not Jill. These ladies’ courtesy
Might well have made our sport a comedy.
