Enter a Servingman My lord, your son was gone before I came. He was? Why so, go all which way it will.
The nobles they are fled. The commons they are cold,
And will, I fear, revolt on Hereford’s side.
Sirrah, get thee to Pleshey, to my sister Gloucester.
Bid her send me presently a thousand pound—
Hold; take my ring.
