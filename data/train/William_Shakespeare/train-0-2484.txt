‘Why work’st thou mischief in thy pilgrimage,
Unless thou couldst return to make amends?
One poor retiring minute in an age
Would purchase thee a thousand thousand friends,
Lending him wit that to bad debtors lends. O this dread night, wouldst thou one hour come
back,
I could prevent this storm and shun thy wrack!
