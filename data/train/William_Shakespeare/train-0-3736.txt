Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss. CAPULET’S WIFE So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
Which you so weep for. JULIET Feeling so the loss, I cannot choose but ever weep the friend. CAPULET’S WIFE Well, girl, thou weep’st not so much for his death
As that the villain lives which slaughtered him.
