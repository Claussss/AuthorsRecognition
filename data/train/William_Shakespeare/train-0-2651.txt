COUNTESS OF SALISBURY As easy may my intellectual soul
Be lent away and yet my body live
As lend my body, palace to my soul,
Away from her and yet retain my soul.
My body is her bower, her court, her abbey;
And she an angel, pure, divine, unspotted.
If I should lend her house, my lord, to thee,
I kill my poor soul, and my poor soul me.
