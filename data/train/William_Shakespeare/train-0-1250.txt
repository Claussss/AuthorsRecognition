KING HENRY Master Lieutenant, now that God and friends
Have shaken Edward from the regal seat
And turned my captive state to liberty,
My fear to hope, my sorrows unto joys,
At our enlargement what are thy due fees? Subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereignsâ€”
But if an humble prayer may prevail,
I then crave pardon of your majesty.
