No more, my good Lord Mayor; but thanks to all
That on so short a summons you would come
To visit him that holds your kindness dear.
[To Lady More] Madam, you are not merry with my Lady
Mayoress
And these fair ladies. Pray ye, seat them all.
[To Lord Mayor] And here, my lord, let me appoint your
place;
The rest to seat themselves. Nay, Iâ€™ll weary ye;
You will not long in haste to visit me.
