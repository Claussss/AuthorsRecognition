BARDOLPH Hear me, hear me what I say. He draws his sword
He that strikes the first stroke, Iâ€™ll run him up to the
hilts, as I am a soldier. An oath of mickle might, and fury shall abate.
They sheathe their swords
(To Nim) Give me thy fist, thy forefoot to me give. 65
Thy spirits are most tall. NIM I will cut thy throat one time or other, in fair terms, that is the humour of it.
