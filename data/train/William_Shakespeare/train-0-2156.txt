Enter Sir Richard Ratcliffe How now, what news? Most mighty sovereign, on the western coast
Rideth a puissant navy. To our shores
Throng many doubtful, hollow-hearted friends,
Unarmed and unresolved, to beat them back.
â€˜Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral,
And there they hull, expecting but the aid
Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.
