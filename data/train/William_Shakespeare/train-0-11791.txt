’Tis well said again, And ’tis a kind of good deed to say well—
And yet words are no deeds. My father loved you.
He said he did, and with his deed did crown
His word upon you. Since I had my office,
I have kept you next my heart, have not alone
Employed you where high profits might come home,
But pared my present havings to bestow
My bounties upon you.
