Enter Constance, distracted, with her hair about her ears  Look who comes here! A grave unto a soul,
Holding th’eternal spirit against her will
In the vile prison of afflicted breath.—
I prithee, lady, go away with me. 20 Lo, now, now see the issue of your peace! KING PHILIP Patience, good lady; comfort, gentle Constance.
