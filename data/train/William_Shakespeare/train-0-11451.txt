Full fathom five thy father lies. Of his bones are coral made;
Those are pearls that were his eyes;
Nothing of him that doth fade
But doth suffer a sea-change
Into something rich and strange.
Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell: Hark, now I hear them. Ding-dong bell.  The ditty does remember my drowned father.
This is no mortal business, nor no sound
That the earth owes.
