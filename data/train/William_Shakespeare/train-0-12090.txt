Enter the Second Friend JAILER Pray heaven it hold so. SECOND FRIEND Be of good comfort, man. I bring you news,
Good news. They are welcome. SECOND FRIEND Palamon has cleared you,
 And got your pardon, and discovered how
And by whose means he scaped—which was your
daughter’s,
Whose pardon is procured too; and the prisoner,
Not to be held ungrateful to her goodness,
Has given a sum of money to her marriage—
A large one, I’ll assure you.
