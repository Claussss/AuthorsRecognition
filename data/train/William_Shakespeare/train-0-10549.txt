Most worthy madam, Your honour and your goodness is so evident
That your free undertaking cannot miss
A thriving issue. There is no lady living
So meet for this great errand. Please your ladyship
To visit the next room, Iâ€™ll presently
Acquaint the Queen of your most noble offer,
Who but today hammered of this design
But durst not tempt a minister of honour
Lest she should be denied.
