Our sacks shall be a mean to sack the city,
And we be lords and rulers over Rouen.
Therefore we’ll knock. WATCH (within) JOAN Paysans, la pauvre gens de France: Poor market folks that come to sell their corn. WATCH (opening the gates) Enter, go in. The market bell is rung. JOAN (aside) Now, Rouen, I’ll shake thy bulwarks to the ground.
