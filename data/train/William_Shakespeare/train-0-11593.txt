All torment, trouble, wonder, and amazement
Inhabits here. Some heavenly power guide us
Out of this fearful country! Behold, sir King, The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero.
For more assurance that a living prince
Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body;
And to thee and thy company I bid
A hearty welcome.
