DUKE (to Pompey) Fie, sirrah, a bawd, a wicked bawd!
The evil that thou causest to be done,
That is thy means to live. Do thou but think
What ‘tis to cram a maw or clothe a back
From such a filthy vice. Say to thyself,
’From their abominable and beastly touches
I drink, I eat, array myself, and live’.
Canst thou believe thy living is a life,
So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.
