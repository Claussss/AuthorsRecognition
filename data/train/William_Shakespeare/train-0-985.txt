Exeunt soldiers (To Buckingham) And let my sovereign, virtuous
Henry,
Command my eldest son—nay, all my sons—
As pledges of my fealty and love.
I’ll send them all as willing as I live.
Lands, goods, horse, armour, anything I have
Is his to use, so Somerset may die. York, I commend this kind submission.
We twain will go into his highness’ tent.
