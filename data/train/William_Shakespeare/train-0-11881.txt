And has done half an hour, to know your pleasures. LORD CHANCELLOR Let him come in. DOORKEEPER (to Cranmer) Your grace may enter now. Cranmer approaches the Council table LORD CHANCELLOR My good lord Archbishop, I’m very sorry
To sit here at this present and behold
That chair stand empty, but we all are men
In our own natures frail, and capable
Of our flesh; few are angels; out of which frailty
And want of wisdom, you, that best should teach us,
Have misdemeaned yourself, and not a little,
Toward the King first, then his laws, in filling
The whole realm, by your teaching and your chaplains’—
For so we are informed—with new opinions,
Diverse and dangerous, which are heresies,
And, not reformed, may prove pernicious.
