And I wish, my liege, You had only in your silent judgement tried it
Without more overture. How could that be? Either thou art most ignorant by age
Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo’s flight
Added to their familiarity,
Which was as gross as ever touched conjecture
That lacked sight only, naught for approbation
But only seeing, all other circumstances
Made up to th’ deed—doth push on this proceeding.
Yet for a greater confirmation—
For in an act of this importance ’twere
Most piteous to be wild—I have dispatched in post
To sacred Delphos, to Apollo’s temple,
Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know
Of stuffed sufficiency. Now from the oracle
They will bring all, whose spiritual counsel had
Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?
