Health and all happiness to my lord the King. I thank thee, Clifford. Say, what news with thee?
Nay, do not fright us with an angry lookâ€”
We are thy sovereign, Clifford; kneel again.
For thy mistaking so, we pardon thee. This is my king, York; I do not mistake.
But thou mistakes me much to think I do.
(To King Henry)
To Bedlam with him! Is the man grown mad?
