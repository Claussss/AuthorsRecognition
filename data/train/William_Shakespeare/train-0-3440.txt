Bolingbroke rises (To York) Uncle, give me your hands. Nay, dry your
eyes.
Tears show their love, but want their remedies.
(To Bolingbroke) Cousin, I am too young to be your father,
Though you are old enough to be my heir.
What you will have Iâ€™ll give, and willing too;
For do we must what force will have us do.
Set on towards London, cousin: is it so?
