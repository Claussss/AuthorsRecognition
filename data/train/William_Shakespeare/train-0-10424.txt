Our general will no more hear from thence. SECOND WATCHMAN You’ll see your Rome embraced with fire before
You’ll speak with Coriolanus. MENENIUS Good my friends, If you have heard your general talk of Rome
And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks
My name hath touched your ears. It is Menenius.
