FIRST OFFICER No, sir, no jot. I know your favour well,
Though now you have no seacap on your head.
(To Second Officer) Take him away, he knows I know
him well. I must obey. (To Viola) This comes with seeking you.
But thereâ€™s no remedy, I shall answer it.
What will you do now my necessity
Makes me to ask you for my purse? It grieves me
Much more for what I cannot do for you
Than what befalls myself. You stand amazed,
But be of comfort.
