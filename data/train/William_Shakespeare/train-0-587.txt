Enter servants severally NATHANIEL Peter, didst ever see the like? PETER He kills her in her own humour. Enter Curtis, a servant GRUMIO Where is he? CURTIS In her chamber, Making a sermon of continency to her,
And rails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul,
Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak,
And sits as one new risen from a dream.
Away, away, for he is coming hither.
