LEAR My wit begins to turn. (To Fool) Come on, my boy. How dost, my boy? Art
cold?
I am cold myself.—Where is this straw, my fellow?
The art of our necessities is strange,
That can make vile things precious. Come, your
hovel.—
Poor fool and knave, I have one part of my heart
That sorrows yet for thee.
