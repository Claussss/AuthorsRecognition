He shall kill two of us, and men indeed.
But that’s no matter, let him kill one first.
Win me and wear me. Let him answer me.
Come follow me boy, come sir boy, come follow me,
Sir boy, I’ll whip you from your foining fence.
Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will. LEONATO Brother. Content yourself. God knows, I loved my niece,
And she is dead, slandered to death by villains
That dare as well answer a man indeed
As I dare take a serpent by the tongue.
Boys, apes, braggarts, jacks, milksops!
