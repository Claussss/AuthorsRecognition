4.1
Enter King Claudius to Queen Gertrude 
KING CLAUDIUS There’s matter in these sighs, these profound heaves;
You must translate. ’Tis fit we understand them.
Where is your son? QUEEN GERTRUDE Ah, my good lord, what have I seen tonight! KING CLAUDIUS What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet? QUEEN GERTRUDE Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit,
Behind the arras hearing something stir,
He whips his rapier out and cries ‘A rat, a ratl’,
And in his brainish apprehension kills
The unseen good old man.
