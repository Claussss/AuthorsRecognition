Flourish. Enter Ulysses, Diomedes, Nestor, Agamemnon, Menelaus, Ajax, and Calchas Now, princes, for the service I have done you,
Th‘advantage of the time prompts me aloud
To call for recompense. Appear it to your mind
That through the sight I bear in things to come
I have abandoned Troy, left my profession,
Incurred a traitor’s name, exposed myself
From certain and possessed conveniences
To doubtful fortunes, sequest’ring from me all
That time, acquaintance, custom, and condition
Made tame and most familiar to my nature,
And here to do you service am become
As new into the world, strange, unacquainted.
I do beseech you, as in way of taste,
To give me now a little benefit
Out of those many registered in promise
Which you say live to come in my behalf.
