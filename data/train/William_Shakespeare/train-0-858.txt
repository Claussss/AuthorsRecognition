I’ll call him presently, my noble lord. Lords, take your places; and, I pray you all,
Proceed no straiter ’gainst our uncle Gloucester
Than from true evidence, of good esteem,
He be approved in practice culpable. QUEEN MARGARET God forbid any malice should prevail
That faultless may condemn a noble man!
Pray God he may acquit him of suspicion!
