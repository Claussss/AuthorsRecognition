VILLIERS (receiving back the paper) I humbly thank your grace. I must dispatch
And send this passport first unto the Earl,
And then I will attend your highness’ pleasure. Do so, Villiers. And Charles, when he hath need,
Be such his soldiers, howsoever he speed. Exit Villiers KING OF FRANCE Come, Charles, and arm thee. Edward is entrapped.
The Prince of Wales is fall’n into our hands,
And we have compassed him. He cannot scape.
