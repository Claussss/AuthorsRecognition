Lord Stafford’s father, Duke of Buckingham,
Is either slain or wounded dangerous.
I cleft his beaver with a downright blow.
That this is true, father, behold his blood.
He shows a bloody sword MONTAGUE to York And, brother, here’s the Earl of Wiltshire’s blood, He shows a bloody sword Whom I encountered as the battles joined.
