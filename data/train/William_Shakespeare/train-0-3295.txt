BOLINGBROKE Many years of happy days befall
My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege! Each day still better others’ happiness,
Until the heavens, envying earth’s good hap,
Add an immortal title to your crown! KING RICHARD We thank you both. Yet one but flatters us,
As well appeareth by the cause you come,
Namely, to appeal each other of high treason.
Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object
Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?
