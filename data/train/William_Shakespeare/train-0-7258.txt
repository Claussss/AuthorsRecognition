ACHILLES Dost thou entreat me, Hector? Tomorrow do I meet thee, fell as death;
Tonight, all friends. HECTOR Thy hand upon that match. First, all you peers of Greece, go to my tent.
There in the full convive you. Afterwards,
As Hectorâ€™s leisure and your bounties shall
Concur together, severally entreat him.
Beat loud the taborins, let the trumpets blow,
That this great soldier may his welcome know.
