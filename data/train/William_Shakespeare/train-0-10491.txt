HERMIONE Was not my lord The verier wag o’th’ two? We were as twinned lambs that did frisk i‘th’ sun,
And bleat the one at th’other. What we changed
Was innocence for innocence. We knew not
The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dreamed
That any did. Had we pursued that life,
And our weak spirits ne‘er been higher reared
With stronger blood, we should have answered
heaven
Boldly, ‘Not guilty’, the imposition cleared
Hereditary ours.
