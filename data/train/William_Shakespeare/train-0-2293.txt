Whose vulture thought doth pitch the price so high
That she will draw his lips’ rich treasure dry, And, having felt the sweetness of the spoil,
With blindfold fury she begins to forage.
Her face doth reek and smoke, her blood doth boil,
And careless lust stirs up a desperate courage, Planting oblivion, beating reason back,
Forgetting shame’s pure blush and honour’s wrack.
