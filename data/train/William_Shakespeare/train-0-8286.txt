I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion.
I do repent me that I put it to you.
You would be satisfied? OTHELLO Would? Nay, and I will. And may. But how, how satisfied, my lord?
Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on,
Behold her topped? OTHELLO Death and damnation! O! It were a tedious difficulty, I think,
To bring them to that prospect. Damn them then
If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster
More than their own! What then, how then?
What shall I say? Where’s satisfaction?
It is impossible you should see this,
Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,
As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross
As ignorance made drunk. But yet I say,
If imputation, and strong circumstances
Which lead directly to the door of truth,
Will give you satisfaction, you might ha’t.
