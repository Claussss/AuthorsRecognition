KING OF FRANCE aside Ay, now I call to mind the prophecy—
But I must give no utterance to a fear.
(To Philippe) Return, and hearten up these yielding souls!
Tell them the ravens, seeing them in arms—
So many fair against a famished few—
Come but to dine upon their handiwork,
And prey upon the carrion that they kill.
For when we see a horse laid down to die—
Although not dead—the ravenous birds
Sit watching the departure of his life.
Even so these ravens, for the carcasses
Of those poor English that are marked to die,
Hover about, and if they cry to us
’Tis but for meat that we must kill for them.
Away, and comfort up my soldiers,
And sound the trumpets and at once dispatch
This little business of a silly fraud. Exit Prince Philippe
