See who comes here. My countryman, but yet I know him not. My ever gentle cousin, welcome hither. I know him now. Good God betimes remove
The means that makes us strangers! Stands Scotland where it did? Alas, poor country, Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot
Be called our mother, but our grave, where nothing
But who knows nothing is once seen to smile;
Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air
Are made, not marked; where violent sorrow seems
A modern ecstasy. The dead man’s knell
Is there scarce asked for who, and good men’s lives
Expire before the flowers in their caps,
Dying or ere they sicken.
