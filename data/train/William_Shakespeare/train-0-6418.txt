QUEEN GERTRUDE Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg. I shall in all my best obey you, madam. KING CLAUDIUS Why, ’tis a loving and a fair reply.
Be as ourself in Denmark. (To Gertrude) Madam, come.
This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
No jocund health that Denmark drinks today
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
And the King’s rouse the heavens shall bruit again,
Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come, away.
