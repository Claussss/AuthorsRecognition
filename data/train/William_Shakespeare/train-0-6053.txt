He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,
In his own change or by ill officers,
Hath given me some worthy cause to wish
Things done undone. But if he be at hand,
I shall be satisfied. PINDARUS I do not doubt But that my noble master will appear
Such as he is, full of regard and honour. He is not doubted.â€”A word, Lucillius.
Brutus and Lucillius speak apart
How he received you let me be resolved.
