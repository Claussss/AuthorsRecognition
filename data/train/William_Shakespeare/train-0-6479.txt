KING CLAUDIUS (to Gertrude) Do you think ’tis this? QUEEN GERTRUDE It may be; very likely. Hath there been such a time—I’d fain know that—
That I have positively said ‘ ’Tis so’
When it proved otherwise? KING CLAUDIUS Not that I know. POLONIUS (touching his head, then his shoulder) Take this from this if this be otherwise.
If circumstances lead me I will find
Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
Within the centre.
