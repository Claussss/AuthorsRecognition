He casts away his crutch Hence therefore, thou nice crutch! A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel
Must glove this hand. He snatches off his coif And hence, thou sickly coif! Thou art a guard too wanton for the head
Which princes fleshed with conquest aim to hit.
Now bind my brows with iron, and approach
The ragged‘st hour that time and spite dare bring
To frown upon th’enraged Northumberland!
Let heaven kiss earth ! Now let not nature’s hand
Keep the wild flood confined! Let order die!
And let this world no longer be a stage
To feed contention in a ling’ring act;
But let one spirit of the first-born Cain
Reign in all bosoms, that each heart being set
On bloody courses, the rude scene may end,
And darkness be the burier of the dead!
