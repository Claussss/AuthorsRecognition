You were ever good at sudden commendations,
Bishop of Winchester. But know I come not
To hear such flattery now; and in my presence
They are too thin and base to hide offences.
To me you cannot reach. You play the spaniel,
And think with wagging of your tongue to win me.
But whatsoe’er thou tak’st me for, I’m sure
Thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody.
(To Cranmer) Good man, sit down.
