I’ll send my prayers with him. Exeunt 4.1
A Cauldron. Thunder. Enter the three Witches 
FIRST WITCH Thrice the brinded cat hath mewed. SECOND WITCH Thrice, and once the hedge-pig whined. THIRD WITCH Harpier cries “Tis time, ‘tis time.’ FIRST WITCH Round about the cauldron go,
In the poisoned entrails throw.
Toad that under cold stone
Days and nights has thirty-one
Sweltered venom sleeping got,
Boil thou first i’th’ charmed pot.
