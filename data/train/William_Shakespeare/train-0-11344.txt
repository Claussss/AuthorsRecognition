POSTHUMUS I am merrier to die than thou art to live. JAILER Indeed, sir, he that sleeps feels not the toothache; but a man that were to sleep your sleep, and a hangman to help him to bed, I think he would change places with his officer; for look you, sir, you know not which way you shall go. POSTHUMUS Yes, indeed do I, fellow.
