KING (to Bertram) I am not a day of season, For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail
In me at once. But to the brightest beams
Distracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth.
The time is fair again. My high-repented blames, Dear sovereign, pardon to me. All is whole. Not one word more of the consumed time.
Let’s take the instant by the forward top,
For we are old, and on our quick‘st decrees
Th’inaudible and noiseless foot of time
Steals ere we can effect them. You remember
The daughter of this lord?
