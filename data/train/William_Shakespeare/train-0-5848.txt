HERALD Here is the number of the slaughtered French. KING HARRY What prisoners of good sort are taken, uncle? Charles, Duke of Orl
Jean, Duke of Bourbon, and Lord Boucicault;
Of other lords and barons, knights and squires,
Full fifteen hundred, besides common men. This note doth tell me of ten thousand French
That in the field lie slain. Of princes in this number
And nobles bearing banners, there lie dead
One hundred twenty-six; added to these,
Of knights, esquires, and gallant gentlemen,
Eight thousand and four hundred, of the which
Five hundred were but yesterday dubbed knights.
So that in these ten thousand they have lost
There are but sixteen hundred mercenaries;
The rest are princes, barons, lords, knights, squires,
And gentlemen of blood and quality.
The names of those their nobles that lie dead:
Charles Delabret, High Constable of France;
Jaques of Ch
The Master of the Crossbows, Lord Rambures;
Great-Master of France, the brave Sir Guiscard
Dauphin;
Jean, Duke of Alen
The brother to the Duke of Burgundy;
And 
Grandpr
Beaumont and Marle, Vaudemont and Lestrelles.
Here was a royal fellowship of death.
Where is the number of our English dead?
