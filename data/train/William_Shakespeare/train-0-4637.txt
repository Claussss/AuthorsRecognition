PRINCE HARRY What men? One of them is well known, my gracious lord,
A gross, fat man. CARRIER As fat as butter. PRINCE HARRY The man, I do assure you, is not here,
For I myself at this time have employed him.
And, sheriff, I will engage my word to thee
That I will by tomorrow dinner-time
Send him to answer thee, or any man,
For anything he shall be charged withal.
And so let me entreat you leave the house.
