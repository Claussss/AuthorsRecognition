Enter two with the Lord Saye’s head and Sir James Cromer’s upon two poles CADE But is not this braver? Let them kiss one another, for they loved well when they were alive. The two heads are made to kiss Now part them again, lest they consult about the giving up of some more towns in France. Soldiers, defer the spoil of the city until night. For with these borne before us instead of maces will we ride through the streets, and at every corner have them kiss. Away!
