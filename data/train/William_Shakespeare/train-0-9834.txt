Which better than the first, O dear heaven, bless!
Or ere they meet, in me, O nature, cease. LAFEU (to Bertram) Come on, my son, in whom my house’s name
Must be digested, give a favour from you
To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,
That she may quickly come. Bertram gives Lafeu a ring By my old beard
And ev’ry hair that’s on’t, Helen that’s dead
Was a sweet creature. Such a ring as this,
The last that ere I took her leave at court,
I saw upon her finger.
