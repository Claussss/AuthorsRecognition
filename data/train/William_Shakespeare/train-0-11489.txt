Prithee, say on. The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim
A matter from thee, and a birth, indeed,
Which throes thee much to yield. Although this lord of weak remembrance, this,
Who shall be of as little memory
When he is earthed, hath here almost persuaded—
For he’s a spirit of persuasion, only
Professes to persuade—the King his son’s alive,
’Tis as impossible that he’s undrowned
As he that sleeps here swims.
