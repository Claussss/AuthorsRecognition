Thaisa starts at Pentapolis. At sea in childbed died she, but brought forth
A maid child called Marina, who, O goddess,
Wears yet thy silver liv‘ry. She at Tarsus
Was nursed with Cleon, whom at fourteen years
He sought to murder, but her better stars
Bore her to Mytilene, ’gainst whose shore riding
Her fortunes brought the maid aboard our barque,
Where, by her own most clear remembrance, she
Made known herself my daughter.
