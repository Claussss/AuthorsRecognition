Enter Warwick who draws apart the curtains and
showsGloucester dead in his bed. Bed put forth  And to survey his dead and earthy image,
What were it but to make my sorrow greater? Come hither, gracious sovereign, view this body. That is to see how deep my grave is made:
For with his soul fled all my worldly solace,
For seeing him I see my life in death.
