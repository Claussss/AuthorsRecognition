PROSPERO Ay, with a twink. Before you can say ‘Come’ and ‘Go’, And breathe twice, and cry ‘So, so’,
Each one tripping on his toe
Will be here with mop and mow.
Do you love me, master? No? Dearly, my delicate Ariel. Do not approach
Till thou dost hear me call. Well; I conceive. PROSPERO (to Ferdinand)
