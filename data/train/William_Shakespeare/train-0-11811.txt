O, my lord, Press not a falling man too far. ’Tis virtue.
His faults lie open to the laws. Let them,
Not you, correct him. My heart weeps to see him
So little of his great self. I forgive him. Lord Cardinal, the King’s further pleasure is—
Because all those things you have done of late,
By your power legantine within this kingdom,
Fall into th’ compass of a praemunire—
That therefore such a writ be sued against you,
To forfeit all your goods, lands, tenements,
Chattels, and whatsoever, and to be
Out of the King’s protection. This is my charge.
