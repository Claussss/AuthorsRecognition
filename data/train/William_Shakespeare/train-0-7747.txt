MORE Still thou harp’st on that. ‘Tis sin for to deserve that banishment;
But he that ne’er knew court courts sweet content. O, but dear husband— I will not hear thee, wife. The winding labyrinth of thy strange discourse
Will ne’er have end. Sit still, and, my good wife,
Entreat thy tongue be stilt—or, credit me,
Thou shalt not understand a word we speak.
We’ll talk in Latin.
[To Roper] Humida vallis raros patitur fulminis ictus.
More rest enjoys the subject meanly bred
Than he that bears the kingdom in his head.
