Tut, that’s a foolish observation—
Richard, be Duke of Gloucester. Now to London
To see these honours in possession. Exeunt. York’s head is removed 
3.1
Enter two Gamekeepers, with crossbows in their hands 
FIRST GAMEKEEPER Under this thick-grown brake we’ll shroud ourselves,
For through this laund anon the deer will come,
And in this covert will we make our stand,
Culling the principal of all the deer.
