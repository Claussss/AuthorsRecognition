CORNWALL Fie, fie, sir. You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames
Into her scornful eyes. Infect her beauty,
You fen-sucked fogs drawn by the pow’rful sun
To fall and blast her pride. REGAN O, the blest gods! So will you wish on me when the rash mood— No, Regan. Thou shalt never have my curse.
Thy tender-hested nature shall not give
Thee o‘er to harshness. Her eyes are fierce, but thine
Do comfort and not burn. ’Tis not in thee
To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,
To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,
And, in conclusion, to oppose the bolt
Against my coming in. Thou better know’st
The offices of nature, bond of childhood,
Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude.
Thy half of the kingdom hast thou not forgot,
Wherein I thee endowed.
