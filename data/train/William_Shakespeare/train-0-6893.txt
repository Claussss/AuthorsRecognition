SIR ANDREW Where shall I find you? SIR TOBY We’ll call thee at the cubiculo. Go. Exit Sir Andrew FABIAN This is a dear manikin to you, Sir Toby. SIR TOBY I have been dear to him, lad, some two thousand strong or so. FABIAN We shall have a rare letter from him; but you’ll not deliver’t. SIR TOBY Never trust me then; and by all means stir on the youth to an answer. I think oxen and wain-ropes cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were opened and you find so much blood in his liver as will clog the foot of a flea, I’ll eat the rest of th’anatomy.
