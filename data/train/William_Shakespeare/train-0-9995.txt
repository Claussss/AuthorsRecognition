Exit Lychorida I thank thee. To the Master We are near Tarsus. Thither, gentle mariner, Alter thy course from Tyre. When canst thou reach it?  By break of day, if the wind cease. Make for Tarsus. There will I visit Cleon, for the babe
Cannot hold out to Tyrus. There I’ll leave it
At careful nursing. Go thy ways, good mariner.
I’ll bring the body presently.
