QUEEN ELIZABETH Shall I be tempted of the devil thus? KING RICHARD Ay, if the devil tempt you to do good. QUEEN ELIZABETH Shall I forget myself to be myself? KING RICHARD Ay, if yourself’s remembrance wrong yourself. QUEEN ELIZABETH Yet thou didst kill my children. KING RICHARD But in your daughter’s womb I bury them,
Where, in that nest of spicery, they will breed
Selves of themselves, to your recomfiture.
