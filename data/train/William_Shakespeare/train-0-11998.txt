Enter the Jailer bove And then I am sure she would love me. How now,
keeper,
Where’s Arcite? Banished—Prince Pirithous Obtained his liberty; but never more,
Upon his oath and life, must he set foot
Upon this kingdom. PALAMON aside He’s a blessed man. He shall see Thebes again, and call to arms
The bold young men that, when he bids ’em charge,
Fall on like fire. Arcite shall have a fortune,
If he dare make himself a worthy lover,
Yet in the field to strike a battle for her;
And if he lose her then, he’s a cold coward.
How bravely may he bear himself to win her
If he be noble Arcite; thousand ways!
Were I at liberty I would do things
Of such a virtuous greatness that this lady,
This blushing virgin, should take manhood to her
And seek to ravish me.
