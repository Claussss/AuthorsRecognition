TROILUS (aside) Behold, I pray you. ULYSSES (aside) Nay, good my lord, go off. You flow to great distraction. Come, my lord. TROILUS (aside) I prithee, stay. ULYSSES (aside) You have not patience. Come. TROILUS (aside) I pray you, stay. By hell and all hellâ€™s torments,
I will not speak a word. DIOMEDES And so good night.
