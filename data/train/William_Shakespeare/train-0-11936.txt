FIRST QUEEN (to the other two Queens) Dowagers, take hands; Let us be widows to our woes; delay
Commends us to a famishing hope. ALL THREE QUEENS SECOND QUEEN We come unseasonably, but when could grief
Cull forth, as unpanged judgement can, fitt’st time
For best solicitation? Why, good ladies, This is a service whereto I am going
Greater than any war—it more imports me
Than all the actions that I have foregone,
Or futurely can cope.
