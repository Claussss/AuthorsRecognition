What other harm have I, good lady, done,
But spoke the harm that is by others done? Which harm within itself so heinous is 40
As it makes harmful all that speak of it. I do beseech you, madam, be content. If thou that bidd‘st me be content wert grim,
Ugly and sland’rous to thy mother’s womb,
Full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains,
Lame, foolish, crooked, swart, prodigious,
Patched with foul moles and eye-offending marks,
I would not care, I then would be content,
For then I should not love thee, no, nor thou
Become thy great birth, nor deserve a crown.
But thou art fair, and at thy birth, dear boy,
Nature and Fortune joined to make thee great.
Of Nature’s gifts thou mayst with lilies boast,
And with the half-blown rose. But Fortune, O,
She is corrupted, changed, and won from thee;
Sh’adulterates hourly with thine uncle John,
And with her golden hand hath plucked on France
To tread down fair respect of sovereignty,
And made his majesty the bawd to theirs.
France is a bawd to Fortune and King John,
That strumpet Fortune, that usurping John.
(To Salisbury) Tell me, thou fellow, is not France
forsworn ?
Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
And leave those woes alone, which I alone
Am bound to underbear.
