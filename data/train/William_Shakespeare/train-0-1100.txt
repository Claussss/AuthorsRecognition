Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?
And when came George from Burgundy to England? Some six miles off the Duke is with his soldiers;
And for your brother—he was lately sent
From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,
With aid of soldiers to this needful war. ‘Twas odd belike when valiant Warwick fled.
Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,
But ne’er till now his scandal of retire.
