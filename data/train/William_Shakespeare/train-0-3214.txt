LONGUEVILLE A calf, fair lady? CATHERINE No, a fair lord calf. LONGUEVILLE Let’s part the word. CATHERINE No, I’ll not be your half. Take all and wean it, it may prove an ox. LONGUEVILLE Look how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks !
Will you give horns, chaste lady? Do not so. Then die a calf before your horns do grow.
