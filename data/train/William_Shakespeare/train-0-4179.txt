When workmen strive to do better than well,
They do confound their skill in covetousness;
And oftentimes excusing of a fault
Doth make the fault the worser by thâ€™excuse;
As patches set upon a little breach
Discredit more in hiding of the fault
Than did the fault before it was so patched. To this effect: before you were new-crowned
We breathed our counsel, but it pleased your
highness
To overbear it; and we are all well pleased,
Since all and every part of what we would
Doth make a stand at what your highness will.
