Exeunt Ghosts Enter abovethe Ghost of Lord Hastings GHOST OF HASTINGS (to Richard) Bloody and guilty, guiltily awake,
And in a bloody battle end thy days.
Think on Lord Hastings, then despair and die.
(To Richmond) Quiet, untroubled soul, awake, awake!
Arm, fight, and conquer for fair Englandâ€™s sake.
