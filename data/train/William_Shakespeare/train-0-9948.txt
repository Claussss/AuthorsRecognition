We are honoured much by good Simonides. KING SIMONIDES Your presence glads our days; honour we love,
For who hates honour hates the gods above. MARSHAL (to Pericles) Sir, yonder is your place. PERICLES Some other is more fit. FIRST KNIGHT Contend not, sir, for we are gentlemen
Have neither in our hearts nor outward eyes
Envied the great, nor shall the low despise.
