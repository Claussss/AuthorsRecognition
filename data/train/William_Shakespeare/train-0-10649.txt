MOPSA We can both sing it. If thou‘lt bear a part thou shalt hear; ’tis in three parts. DORCAS We had the tune on’t a month ago. AUTOLYCUS I can bear my part, you must know, ’tis my occupation. Have at it with you. 
CLOWN We’ll have this song out anon by ourselves. My father and the gentlemen are in sad talk, and we’ll not trouble them. Come, bring away thy pack after me. Wenches, I’ll buy for you both. Pedlar, let’s have the first choice. Follow me, girls.
