Over the boots? Nay, give me not the boots. No, I will not; for it boots thee not. To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans,
Coy looks with heart-sore sighs, one fading momentâ€™s
mirth
With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights.
If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;
If lost, why then a grievous labour won;
However, but a folly bought with wit,
Or else a wit by folly vanquished.
