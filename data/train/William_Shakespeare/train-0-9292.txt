I cannot hope Caesar and Antony shall well greet together.
His wife that’s dead did trespasses to Caesar,
His brother warred upon him, although, I think,
Not moved by Antony. I know not, Menas, How lesser enmities may give way to greater.
Were’t not that we stand up against them all,
’Twere pregnant they should square between
themselves,
For they have entertained cause enough
To draw their swords. But how the fear of us
May cement their divisions, and bind up
The petty difference, we yet not know.
Be’t as our gods will have’t; it only stands
Our lives upon to use our strongest hands.
Come, Menas.
