A proper jest, and never heard before,
That Suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth
For costs and charges in transporting her!
She should have stayed in France and starved in
France
Before— CARDINAL BEAUFORT My lord of Gloucester, now ye grow too hot!
It was the pleasure of my lord the King. My lord of Winchester, I know your mind.
’Tis not my speeches that you do mislike,
But ‘tis my presence that doth trouble ye.
Rancour will out. Proud prelate, in thy face
I see thy fury. If I longer stay
We shall begin our ancient bickerings—
But I’ll be gone, and give thee leave to speak.
Lordings, farewell, and say when I am gone,
I prophesied France will be lost ere long. Exit
