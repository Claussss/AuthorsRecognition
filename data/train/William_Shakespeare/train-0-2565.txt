And my laments would be drawn out too long
To tell them all with one poor tired tongue. â€˜Then be this all the task it hath to say:
Dear husband, in the interest of thy bed
A stranger came, and on that pillow lay
Where thou wast wont to rest thy weary head;
And what wrong else may be imagined By foul enforcement might be done to me,
From that, alas, thy Lucrece is not free.
