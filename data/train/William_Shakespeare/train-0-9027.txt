ANGUS (to Macbeth) We are sent To give thee from our royal master thanks;
Only to herald thee into his sight,
Not pay thee. And, for an earnest of a greater honour,
He bade me from him call thee Thane of Cawdor,
In which addition, hail, most worthy thane,
For it is thine. What, can the devil speak true?
