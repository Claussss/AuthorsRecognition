My mistress, dearest; And I thus humble ever. MIRANDA My husband then? FERDINAND Ay, with a heart as willing As bondage e’er of freedom. Here’s my hand. And mine, with my heart in’t. And now farewell
Till half an hour hence. A thousand thousand. Exeunt severally Miranda and Ferdinand So glad of this as they I cannot be,
Who are surprised with all; but my rejoicing
At nothing can be more. I’ll to my book,
For yet ere supper-time must I perform
Much business appertaining.
