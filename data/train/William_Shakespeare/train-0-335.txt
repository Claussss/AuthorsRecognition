Then you must undertake to slander him. And that, my lord, I shall be loath to do.
â€™Tis an ill office for a gentleman,
Especially against his very friend. Where your good word cannot advantage him
Your slander never can endamage him.
Therefore the office is indifferent,
Being entreated to it by your friend.
