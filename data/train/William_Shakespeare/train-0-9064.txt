I’ll go no more. I am afraid to think what I have done,
Look on’t again I dare not. LADY MACBETH Infirm of purpose! Give me the daggers. The sleeping and the dead
Are but as pictures. ’Tis the eye of childhood
That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed
I’ll gild the faces of the grooms withal,
For it must seem their guilt. Exit
