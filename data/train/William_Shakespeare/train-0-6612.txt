CAPTAIN I will do’t, my lord. FORTINBRAS Go safely on. Exeunt marching 4.5
Enter Queen Gertrude and Horatio 
QUEEN GERTRUDE I will not speak with her. She is importunate,
Indeed distraught. Her mood will needs be pitied. QUEEN GERTRUDE What would she have? She speaks much of her father, says she hears
There’s tricks i’th’ world, and hems, and beats her
heart,
Spurns enviously at straws, speaks things in doubt
That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,
Yet the unshap
The hearers to collection. They aim at it,
And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts,
Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them,
Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
