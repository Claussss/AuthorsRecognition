Now good my lord, Let there be some more test made of my metal
Before so noble and so great a figure
Be stamped upon it. DUKE No more evasion. We have with leavened and prepared choice
Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours. Angelo takes his commission Our haste from hence is of so quick condition
That it prefers itself, and leaves unquestioned
Matters of needful value. We shall write to you
As time and our concernings shall importune,
How it goes with us; and do look to know
What doth befall you here. So fare you well.
To thâ€™ hopeful execution do I leave you
Of your commissions.
