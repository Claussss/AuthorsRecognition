No, if a scot would save his soul he shall not. I’ll keep them, by this hand. WORCESTER You start away, And lend no ear unto my purposes. Those prisoners you shall keep. HOTSPUR Nay, I will; that’s flat. He said he would not ransom Mortimer,
Forbade my tongue to speak of Mortimer;
But I will find him when he lies asleep,
And in his ear I’ll hollo ‘Mortimerl’
Nay, I’ll have a starling shall be taught to speak
Nothing but ‘Mortimer’, and give it him
To keep his anger still in motion.
