Not so, my lord. Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.
Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes.
Our enemies have beat us to the pit, Low alarums  It is more worthy to leap in ourselves
Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,
Thou knowâ€™st that we two went to school together.
Even for that, our love of old, I prithee,
Hold thou my sword hilts whilst I run on it.
