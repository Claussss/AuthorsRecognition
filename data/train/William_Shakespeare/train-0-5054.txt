Elves, list your names. Silence, you airy toys.
Cricket, to Windsor chimneys shalt thou leap.
Where fires thou find’st unraked and hearths unswept,
There pinch the maids as blue as bilberry.
Our radiant Queen hates sluts and sluttery. SIR JOHN (aside) They are fairies. He that speaks to them shall die.
I’ll wink and couch; no man their works must eye.
