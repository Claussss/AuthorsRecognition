The precise Angelo? O, ‘tis the cunning livery of hell
The damnedest body to invest and cover
In precise guards! Dost thou think, Claudio:
If I would yield him my virginity,
Thou might’st be freed! O heavens, it cannot be! Yes, he would give’t thee, from this rank offence,
So to offend him still. This night’s the time
That I should do what I abhor to name,
Or else thou diest tomorrow.
