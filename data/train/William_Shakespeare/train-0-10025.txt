LEONINE Come, say your prayers. MARINA What mean you? If you require a little space for prayer
I grant it. Pray, but be not tedious.
The gods are quick of ear, and I am sworn
To do my work with haste. MARINA Why would you kill me? To satisfy my lady. Why would she have me killed? Now, as I can remember, by my troth
I never did her hurt in all my life.
I never spake bad word, nor did ill turn
To any living creature. Believe me, la.
I never killed a mouse nor hurt a fly.
I trod once on a worm against my will,
But I wept for it. How have I offended
Wherein my death might yield her any profit
Or my life imply her danger?
