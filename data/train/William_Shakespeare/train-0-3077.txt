Enter Navarre, Longueville, Dumaine, and Biron Here comes Navarre. KING Fair Princess, welcome to the court of Navarre. PRINCESS ‘Fair’ I give you back again, and welcome I have not yet. The roof of this court is too high to be yours, and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine. You shall be welcome, madam, to my court.
