DON PEDRO Will you have me, lady? BEATRICE No, my lord, unless I might have another for working days. Your grace is too costly to wear every day. But I beseech your grace, pardon me. I was born to speak all mirth and no matter. DON PEDRO Your silence most offends me, and to be merry best becomes you; for out oâ€™ question, you were born in a merry hour.
