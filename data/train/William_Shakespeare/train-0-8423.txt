GRAZIANO (to Iago) Fie, your sword upon a woman? O thou dull Moor, that handkerchief thou speak’st of
I found by fortune and did give my husband,
For often, with a solemn earnestness—
More than indeed belonged to such a trifle—
He begged of me to steal’t. IAGO Villainous whore! She give it Cassio? No, alas, I found it,
And I did give’t my husband.
