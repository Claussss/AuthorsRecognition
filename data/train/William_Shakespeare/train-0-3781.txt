Death, that hath ta’en her hence to make me wail,
Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.
Enter Friar Laurence and Paris, with Musicians FRIAR LAURENCE Come, is the bride ready to go to church? Ready to go, but never to return.
(To Paris) O son, the night before thy wedding day
Hath death lain with thy wife. See, there she lies,
Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
Death is my son-in-law, death is my heir.
My daughter he hath wedded. I will die,
And leave him all. Life, living, all is death’s.
