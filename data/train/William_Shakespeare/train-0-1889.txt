Enter Queen Elizabeth, Lord Rivers, Marquis Dorset, and Lord Gray 
RIVERS (to Elizabeth) Have patience, madam. There’s no doubt his majesty
Will soon recover his accustomed health. GRAY (to Elizabeth) In that you brook it ill, it makes him worse.
Therefore, for God’s sake entertain good comfort,
And cheer his grace with quick and merry eyes.
