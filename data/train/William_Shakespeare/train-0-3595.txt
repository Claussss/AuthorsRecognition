ROMEO Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace! Thou talkâ€™st of nothing. MERCUTIO True. I talk of dreams, Which are the children of an idle brain,
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
Which is as thin of substance as the air,
And more inconstant than the wind, who woos
Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
And, being angered, puffs away from thence,
Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
