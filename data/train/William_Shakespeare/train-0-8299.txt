DESDEMONA (offering a handkerchief) Here, my lord. That which I gave you. DESDEMONA I have it not about me. OTHELLO Not? No, faith, my lord. OTHELLO That’s a fault. That handkerchief
Did an Egyptian to my mother give.
She was a charmer, and could almost read
The thoughts of people. She told her, while she kept it
’Twould make her amiable, and subdue my father
Entirely to her love; but if she lost it,
Or made a gift of it, my father’s eye
Should hold her loath
After new fancies. She, dying, gave it me,
And bid me, when my fate would have me wived,
To give it her. I did so, and take heed on’t.
Make it a darling, like your precious eye.
To lose’t or give’t away were such perdition
As nothing else could match.
