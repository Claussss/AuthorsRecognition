KING SIMONIDES (aside) Now, by the gods, I do applaud his courage. My actions are as noble as my blood,
That never relished of a base descent. 55
I came unto your court in search of honour,
And not to be a rebel to your state;
And he that otherwise accounts of me,
This sword shall prove he’s honour’s enemy.
