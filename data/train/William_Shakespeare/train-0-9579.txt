Be thou blessed, Bertram, and succeed thy father
In manners as in shape. Thy blood and virtue
Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness
Share with thy birthright. Love all, trust a few,
Do wrong to none. Be able for thine enemy
Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend
Under thy own life’s key. Be checked for silence
But never taxed for speech. What heaven more will
That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,
Fall on thy head. Farewell. (To Lafeu) My lord,
’Tis an unseasoned courtier. Good my lord,
Advise him.
