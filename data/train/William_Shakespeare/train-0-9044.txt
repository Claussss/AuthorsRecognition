This guest of summer, The temple-haunting martlet, does approve
By his loved mansionry that the heavensâ€™ breath
Smells wooingly here. No jutty, frieze,
Buttress, nor coign of vantage but this bird
Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle;
Where they most breed and haunt I have observed
The air is delicate.
