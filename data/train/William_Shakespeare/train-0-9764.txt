A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee. For which live long to thank both heaven and me.
You may so in the end. Exit Bertram
My mother told me just how he would woo,
As if she sat in’s heart. She says all men
Have the like oaths. He had sworn to marry me
When his wife’s dead; therefore I’ll lie with him
When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid,
Marry that will; I live and die a maid.
Only, in this disguise I think’t no sin
To cozen him that would unjustly win. Exit
