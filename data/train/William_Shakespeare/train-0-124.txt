HAMLET Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her favour? GUILDENSTERN Faith, her privates we. In a play where the upper-class protagonists tend to speak prose, it takes moments of special drama to motivate a switch to verse, as in the scene when Claudio accuses Hero of being unfaithful (Much Ado About Nothing, 4.1). Beatrice uses nothing but prose in the first half of this play, but, left alone after overhearing the news that Benedick loves her, she expresses her newly heightened sensibilities in ten lines of rhyming verse (3.1.107-16). In Othello (1.3), the Duke of Venice speaks only verse in debating the question of Othelloâ€™s love for Desdemona, but when he has to recount the affairs of state, he resorts to prose (1.3.220-7).
