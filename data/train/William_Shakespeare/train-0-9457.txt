I’ll strike, and cry ‘Take all!’ Well said. Come on! Call forth my household servants. Let’s tonight
Be bounteous at our meal. Enter Servitors Give me thy hand. Thou hast been rightly honest; so hast thou,
Thou, and thou, and thou; you have served me well,
And kings have been your fellows. CLEOPATRA (to Enobarbus)
