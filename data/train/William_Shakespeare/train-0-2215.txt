b. AFTER 1.3.166 RICHARD GLOUCESTER Wert thou not banish QUEEN MARGARET I was, but I do find more pain in banishment
Than death can yield me here by my abode. c. AFTER I.4.68 O God! If my deep prayers cannot appease thee
But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,
Yet execute thy wrath in me alone.
O spare my guiltless wife and my poor children.
