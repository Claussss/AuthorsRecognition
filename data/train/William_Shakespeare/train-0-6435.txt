Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord. The time invites you. Go; your servants tend. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
What I have said to you. ’Tis in my memory locked,
And you yourself shall keep the key of it. LAERTES Farewell. What is’t, Ophelia, he hath said to you? So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
