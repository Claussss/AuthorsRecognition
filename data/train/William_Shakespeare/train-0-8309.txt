EMILIA Pray heaven it be State matters, as you think, and no conception
Nor no jealous toy concerning you. Alas the day, I never gave him cause. But jealous souls will not be answered so.
They are not ever jealous for the cause,
But jealous for theyâ€™re jealous. It is a monster
Begot upon itself, born on itself.
