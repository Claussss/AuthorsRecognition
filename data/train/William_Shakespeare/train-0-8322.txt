O, thou art wise, ’tis certain. IAGO Stand you a while apart. Confine yourself but in a patient list.
Whilst you were here, o
A passion most unsuiting such a man—
Cassio came hither. I shifted him away,
And laid good ’scuse upon your ecstasy,
Bade him anon return and here speak with me,
The which he promised. Do but encave yourself,
And mark the fleers, the gibes and notable scorns
That dwell in every region of his face.
For I will make him tell the tale anew,
Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when
He hath and is again to cope your wife.
I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience,
Or I shall say you’re all-in-all in spleen,
And nothing of a man.
