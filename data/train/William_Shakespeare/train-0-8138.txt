The Duke does greet you, general, And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance
Even on the instant. What is the matter, think you? Something from Cyprus, as I may divine;
It is a business of some heat. The galleys
Have sent a dozen sequent messengers
This very night at one another’s heels,
And many of the consuls, raised and met,
Are at the Duke’s already. You have been hotly called
for,
When, being not at your lodging to be found,
The senate sent about three several quests
To search you out.
