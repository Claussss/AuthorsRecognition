My lord, he stands indicted for a purse.
He hath been tried; the jury is together. Who sent him in? SURESBY That did I, my lord. Had he had right, he had been hanged ere this,
The only captain of the cutpurse crew. LORD MAYOR What is his name? As his profession is: Lifter, my lord,
One that can lift a purse right cunningly.
