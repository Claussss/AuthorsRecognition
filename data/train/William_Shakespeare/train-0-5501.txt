Exeunt Hero and Ursula BEATRICE (coming forward) What fire is in mine ears? Can this be true?
Stand I condemned for pride and scorn so much ?
Contempt, farewell; and maiden pride, adieu.
No glory lives behind the back of such.
And, Benedick, love on. I will requite thee,
Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand.
If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee
To bind our loves up in a holy band.
For others say thou dost deserve, and I
Believe it better than reportingly.
