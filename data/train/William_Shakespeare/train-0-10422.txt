You know the very road into his kindness,
And cannot lose your way. Good faith, I’ll prove him. Speed how it will, I shall ere long have knowledge
Of my success. COMINIUS He’ll never hear him. SICINIUS Not? I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye
Red as ‘twould burn Rome, and his injury
The jailer to his pity. I kneeled before him;
’Twas very faintly he said ‘Rise’, dismissed me
Thus with his speechless hand. What he would do
He sent in writing after me, what he would not,
Bound with an oath to hold to his conditions.
So that all hope is vain unless his noble mother
And his wife, who as I hear mean to solicit him
For mercy to his country. Therefore let’s hence,
And with our fair entreaties haste them on.
