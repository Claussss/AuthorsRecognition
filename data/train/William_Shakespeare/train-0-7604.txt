Let’s to these simple men, for many sweat
Under this act that knows not the law’s debt
Which hangs upon their lives. For silly men
Plod on they know not how; like a fool’s pen
That, ending, shows not any sentence writ
Linked but to common reason or slightest wit.
These follow for no harm, but yet incur
Self penalty with those that raised this stir.
I’ God’s name on, to calm our private foes
With breath of gravity, not dangerous blows.
