What you can make her do I am content to look on; what to speak,
I am content to hear; for â€™tis as easy
To make her speak as move. It is required You do awake your faith. Then, all stand still.
Or those that think it is unlawful business
I am about, let them depart. No foot shall stir. Music; awake her; strike!
