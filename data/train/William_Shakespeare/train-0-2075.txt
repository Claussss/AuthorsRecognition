RICHARD GLOUCESTER My lord, there needs no such apology.
I do beseech your grace to pardon me,
Who, earnest in the service of my God,
Deferred the visitation of my friends.
But leaving this, what is your graceâ€™s pleasure? Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,
And all good men of this ungoverned isle.
