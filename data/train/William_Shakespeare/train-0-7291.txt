Have with you, Prince.—My courteous lord, adieu.—
Farewell, revolted fair; and Diomed,
Stand fast and wear a castle on thy head. I’ll bring you to the gates. TROILUS Accept distracted thanks. Exeunt Troilus, Aeneas, and Ulysses THERSITES Would I could meet that rogue Diomed! I would croak like a raven. I would bode, I would bode. Patroclus will give me anything for the intelligence of this whore. The parrot will not do more for an almond than he for a commodious drab. Lechery, lechery, still wars and lechery! Nothing else holds fashion. A burning devil take them! Exit
