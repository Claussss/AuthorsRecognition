QUEEN KATHERINE If I know you well, You were the Duke’s surveyor, and lost your office
On the complaint o’th’ tenants. Take good heed
You charge not in your spleen a noble person
And spoil your nobler soul. I say, take heed;
Yes, heartily beseech you. Let him on. (To the Surveyor) Go forward. BUCKINGHAM’S SURVEYOR On my soul I’ll speak but truth.
