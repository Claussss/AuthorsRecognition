VOLUMNIA Thou art my warrior. I holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady? The noble sister of Publicola,
The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle
That’s candied by the frost from purest snow
And hangs on Dian’s temple—dear Valeria! VOLUMNIA (showing Coriolanus his son) This is a poor epitome of yours,
Which by th’ interpretation of full time
May show like all yourself.
