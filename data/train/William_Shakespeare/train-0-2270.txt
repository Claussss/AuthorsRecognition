But now her cheek was pale; and by and by
It flashed forth fire, as lightning from the sky. Now was she just before him as he sat,
And like a lowly lover down she kneels;
With one fair hand she heaveth up his hat;
Her other tender hand his fair cheek feels. His tend’rer cheek receives her soft hand’s print
As apt as new-fall’n snow takes any dint.
