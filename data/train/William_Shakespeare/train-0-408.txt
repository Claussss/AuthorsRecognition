I warrant you, my lord, more grace than boy. DUKE What mean you by that saying? Please you, I’ll tell you as we pass along,
That you will wonder what hath fortun
Come, Proteus, ’tis your penance but to hear
The story of your loves discovered.
That done, our day of marriage shall be yours,
One feast, one house, one mutual happiness.
