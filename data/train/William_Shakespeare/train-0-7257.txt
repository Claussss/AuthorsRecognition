AJAX Do not chafe thee, cousin.— And you, Achilles, let these threats alone,
Till accident or purpose bring you to’t.
You may have every day enough of Hector,
If you have stomach. The general state, I fear,
Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him. HECTOR (to Achilles) I pray you, let us see you in the field.
We have had pelting wars since you refused
The Grecians’ cause.
