The Ghost beckons Hamlet It beckons you to go away with it
As if it some impartment did desire
To you alone. MARCELLUS (to Hamlet) Look with what courteous action It wafts you to a more removed ground.
But do not go with it. HORATIO (to Hamlet) No, by no means. It will not speak. Then will I follow it.
