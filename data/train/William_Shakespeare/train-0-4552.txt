WORCESTER Hear you, cousin, a word. All studies here I solemnly defy,
Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke.
And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales—
But that I think his father loves him not
And would be glad he met with some mischance—
I would have him poisoned with a pot of ale. Farewell, kinsman. I’ll talk to you
When you are better tempered to attend.
