SECOND OFFICER Come, sir, away. ANTONIO (to Viola) I must entreat of you some of that money. VIOLA What money, sir? For the fair kindness you have showed me here,
And part being prompted by your present trouble,
Out of my lean and low ability
I’ll lend you something. My having is not much.
I’ll make division of my present with you.
Hold, (offering money) there’s half my coffer.
