Could he say less? I offered to awaken his regard
For’s private friends. His answer to me was
He could not stay to pick them in a pile
Of noisome, musty chaff. He said ‘twas folly,
For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt
And still to nose th’offence. For one poor grain or two? I am one of those. His mother, wife, his child,
And this brave fellow too—we are the grains.
(To the tribunes) You are the musty chaff, and you are
smelt
Above the moon. We must be burnt for you.
