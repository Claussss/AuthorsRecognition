Some reasons of this double coronation
I have possessed you with, and think them strong.
And more, more strong, when lesser is my fear
I shall endue you with. Meantime but ask
What you would have reformed that is not well,
And well shall you perceive how willingly
I will both hear and grant you your requests.
