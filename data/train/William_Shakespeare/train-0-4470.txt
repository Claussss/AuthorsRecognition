PORTIA That cannot be. His ring I do accept most thankfully,
And so I pray you tell him. Furthermore,
I pray you show my youth old Shylock’s house. That will I do. NERISSA Sir, I would speak with you. (Aside to Portia) I’ll see if I can get my husband’s ring
Which I did make him swear to keep for ever.
