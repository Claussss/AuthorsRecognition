ENOBARBUS (aside to Agrippa) Will Caesar weep? AGRIPPA (aside to Enobarbus) He has a cloud inâ€™s face. ENOBARBUS (aside to Agrippa) He were the worse for that were he a horse;
So is he, being a man. AGRIPPA (aside to Enobarbus) Why, Enobarbus, When Antony found Julius Caesar dead
He cried almost to roaring, and he wept
When at Philippi he found Brutus slain.
