CASSIUS Mark Antony. ANTONY Pardon me, Caius Cassius. The enemies of Caesar shall say this;
Then in a friend it is cold modesty. I blame you not for praising Caesar so;
But what compact mean you to have with us?
Will you be pricked in number of our friends,
Or shall we on, and not depend on you? Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed
Swayed from the point by looking down on Caesar.
Friends am I with you all, and love you all
Upon this hope: that you shall give me reasons
Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.
