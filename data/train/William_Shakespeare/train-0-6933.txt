VIOLA (aside) Pray God defend me. A little thing would make me tell them how much I lack of a man. FABIAN (to Sir Andrew) Give ground if you see him furious. SIR TOBY Come, Sir Andrew, there’s no remedy, the gentleman will for his honour’s sake have one bout with you, he cannot by the duello avoid it, but he has promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, he will not hurt you. Come on, to’t.
