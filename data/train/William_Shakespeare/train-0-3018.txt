That is the chain, sir, which you had of me. ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE I think it be, sir. I deny it not. ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS (to
Angelo) And you, sir, for this chain arrested me. I think I did, sir. I deny it not. ADRIANA (to Antipholus
of Ephesus) I sent you money, sir, to be your bail,
By Dromio, but I think he brought it not.
