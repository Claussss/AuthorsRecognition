QUEEN MARGARET Go tell this heavy message to the King. Exit Vaux
Ay me! What is this world? What news are these?
But wherefore grieve I at an hour’s poor loss
Omitting Suffolk’s exile, my soul’s treasure?
Why only, Suffolk, mourn I not for thee,
And with the southern clouds contend in tears—
Theirs for the earth’s increase, mine for my sorrow’s?
Now get thee hence. The King, thou know’st, is
coming. 390
If thou be found by me, thou art but dead.
