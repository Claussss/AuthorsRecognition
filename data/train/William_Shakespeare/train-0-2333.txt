Full of respects, yet naught at all respecting;
In hand with all things, naught at all effecting. Here kennelled in a brake she finds a hound,
And asks the weary caitiff for his master;
And there another licking of his wound,
â€™Gainst venomed sores the only sovereign plaster. And here she meets another, sadly scowling,
To whom she speaks; and he replies with howling.
