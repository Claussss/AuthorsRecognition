SICINIUS Sir, the people Must have their voices, neither will they bate
One jot of ceremony. MENENIUS (to Coriolanus) Put them not toâ€™t. Pray you, go fit you to the custom and
Take to you, as your predecessors have,
Your honour with your form. CORIOLANUS It is a part That I shall blush in acting, and might well
Be taken from the people.
