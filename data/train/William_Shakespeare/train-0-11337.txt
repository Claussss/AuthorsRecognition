Thy crystal window ope; look out;
No longer exercise
Upon a valiant race thy harsh
And potent injuries. Since, Jupiter, our son is good,
Take off his miseries. Peep through thy marble mansion. Help,
Or we poor ghosts will cry
To thâ€™ shining synod of the rest
Against thy deity. Help, Jupiter, or we appeal,
And from thy justice fly.
Jupiter descends in thunder and lightning, sitting upon an eagle. He throws a thunderbolt. The ghosts fall on their knees
