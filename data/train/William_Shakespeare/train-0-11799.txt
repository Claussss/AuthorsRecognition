He reads the other paper ‘To th’ Pope’? The letter, as I live, with all the business
I writ to’s holiness. Nay then, farewell.
I have touched the highest point of all my greatness,
And from that full meridian of my glory
I haste now to my setting. I shall fall
Like a bright exhalation in the evening,
And no man see me more.
