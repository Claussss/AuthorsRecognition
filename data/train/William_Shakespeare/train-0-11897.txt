With a true heart And brother-love I do it. Gardiner and Cranmer embrace CRANMER (weeping) And let heaven Witness how dear I hold this confirmation. Good man, those joyful tears show thy true heart.
The common voice, I see, is verified
Of thee which says thus, ‘Do my lord of Canterbury
A shrewd turn, and he’s your friend for ever.’
Come, lords, we trifle time away. I long
To have this young one made a Christian.
As I have made ye one, lords, one remain—
So I grow stronger, you more honour gain.
