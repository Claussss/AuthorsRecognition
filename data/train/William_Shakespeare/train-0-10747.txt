She draws a curtain and reveals the figure of Hermione, standing like a statue  I like your silence; it the more shows off
Your wonder. But yet speak; first you, my liege.
Comes it not something near? LEONTES Her natural posture. Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed
Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she
In thy not chiding, for she was as tender
As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,
Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing
So aged as this seems.
