Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?
How do you, madam? How do you, my good lady? DESDEMONA Faith, half asleep. Good madam, what’s the matter with my lord? EMILIA Why, with my lord, madam. Who is thy lord? EMILIA He that is yours, sweet lady. I ha’ none. Do not talk to me, Emilia.
I cannot weep, nor answers have I none
But what should go by water. Prithee tonight
Lay on my bed my wedding sheets, remember.
And call thy husband hither.
