The commons hath he pilled with grievous taxes,
And quite lost their hearts. The nobles hath he fined
For ancient quarrels, and quite lost their hearts. And daily new exactions are devised,
As blanks, benevolences, and I wot not what.
But what, a’ God’s name, doth become of this? NORTHUMBERLAND Wars hath not wasted it; for warred he hath not,
But basely yielded upon compromise
That which his ancestors achieved with blows.
More hath he spent in peace than they in wars.
