JESSICA In such a night Did Thisbe fearfully o’ertrip the dew
And saw the lion’s shadow ere himself,
And ran dismayed away. LORENZO In such a night Stood Dido with a willow in her hand
Upon the wild sea banks, and waft her love
To come again to Carthage. JESSICA In such a night Medea gathered the enchanted herbs
That did renew old Aeson.
