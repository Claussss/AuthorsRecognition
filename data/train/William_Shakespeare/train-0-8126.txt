Enter Brabanzio in his nightgown at a window above What is the reason of this terrible summons?
What is the matter there? Signor, is all your family within? Are your doors locked? Why, wherefore ask you this? ’Swounds, sir, you’re robbed. For shame, put on your
gown.
Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul.
Even now, now, very now, an old black ram
Is tupping your white ewe. Arise, arise!
Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,
Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you.
Arise, I say.
