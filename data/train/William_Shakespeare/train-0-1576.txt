Enter captains, colours, and trumpeters And, madam, at your father’s castle walls
We’ll crave a parley to confer with him. Sound a parley. Enter Ren See, Rene, see thy daughter prisoner. SUFFOLK To me. I am a soldier, and unapt to weep
Or to exclaim on fortune’s fickleness. Yes, there is remedy enough, my lord.
Assent, and for thy honour give consent
Thy daughter shall be wedded to my king,
Whom I with pain have wooed and won thereto;
And this her easy-held imprisonment
Hath gained thy daughter princely liberty.
