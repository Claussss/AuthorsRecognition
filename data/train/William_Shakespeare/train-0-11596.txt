SEBASTIAN (to Antonio) The devil speaks in him. PROSPERO No. (To Antonio) For you, most wicked sir, whom to call
brother
Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive
Thy rankest fault, all of them, and require
My dukedom of thee, which perforce I know
Thou must restore. If thou beest Prospero, Give us particulars of thy preservation,
How thou hast met us here, whom three hours since
Were wrecked upon this shore, where I have lost—
How sharp the point of this remembrance is!—
My dear son Ferdinand.
