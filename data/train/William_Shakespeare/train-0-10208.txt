’Twill be delivered back on good condition. AUFIDIUS Condition? I would I were a Roman, for I cannot,
Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition?
What good condition can a treaty find
I‘th’ part that is at mercy? Five times, Martius,

True sword to sword, I’ll potch at him some way
Or wrath or craft may get him.
