Pardon me,
 If I were there I’d wink. You must be there—
 This trial is, as ’twere, i’th’ night, and you
The only star to shine. I am extinct.
 There is but envy in that light which shows
The one the other. Darkness, which ever was
The dam of horror, who does stand accursed
Of many mortal millions, may even now,
By casting her black mantle over both,
That neither could find other, get herself
Some part of a good name, and many a murder
Set off whereto she’s guilty.
