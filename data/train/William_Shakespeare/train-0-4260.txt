PRINCE HENRY At Worcester must his body be interred,
For so he willed it. BASTARD Thither shall it then, 100 And happily may your sweet self put on
The lineal state and glory of the land,
To whom with all submission, on my knee,
I do bequeath my faithful services
And true subjection everlastingly. 105
