These are the limbs o’th’ plot. No more, I hope. A monk o’th’ Chartreux. O, Nicholas Hopkins? BRANDON He. My surveyor is false. The o’er-great Cardinal
Hath showed him gold. My life is spanned already.
I am the shadow of poor Buckingham,
Whose figure even this instant cloud puts on
By dark’ning my clear sun. (To Norfolk) My lord,
farewell.
