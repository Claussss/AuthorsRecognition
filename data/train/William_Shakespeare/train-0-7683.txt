My Lord Cardinalâ€™s players? Now trust me, welcome.
You happen hither in a lucky time
To pleasure me and benefit yourselves.
The Mayor of London and some aldermen,
His lady, and their wives are my kind guests
This night at supper. Now, to have a play
Before the banquet will be excellent.
How think you, son Roper?
