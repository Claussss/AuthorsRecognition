O, I am slain! Famine and no other hath slain me! Let ten thousand devils come against me, and give me but the ten meals I have lost, and I’d defy them all. Wither, garden, and be henceforth a burying place to all that do dwell in this house, because the unconquered soul of Cade is fled. Is’t Cade that I have slain, that monstrous traitor?
Sword, I will hallow thee for this thy deed
And hang thee o‘er my tomb when I am dead.
Ne’er shall this blood be wiped from thy point
But thou shalt wear it as a herald’s coat
To emblaze the honour that thy master got.
