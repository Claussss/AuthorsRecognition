WIT [sings] In an arbour green, asleep whereas I lay—
The birds sang sweetly in the midst of the day—
I dream In youth is pleasure, in youth is pleasure. Methought I walked still to and fro,
And from her company I could not go;
But when I waked it was not so. iso In youth is pleasure, in youth is pleasure.
