I do repent me as it is an evil,
And take the shame with joy. There rest. Your partner, as I hear, must die tomorrow,
And I am going with instruction to him.
Grace go with you. Benedicite! Exit Must die tomorrow? O injurious law,
That respites me a life whose very comfort
Is still a dying horror! â€™Tis pity of him.
