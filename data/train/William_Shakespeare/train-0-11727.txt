CARDINAL WOLSEY How? Of me? CARDINAL CAMPEIUS They will not stick to say you envied him,
And fearing he would rise, he was so virtuous,
Kept him a foreign man still, which so grieved him
That he ran mad and died. CARDINAL WOLSEY Heav’n’s peace be with him— That’s Christian care enough. For living murmurers
There’s places of rebuke. He was a fool,
For he would needs be virtuous.
