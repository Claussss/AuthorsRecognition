Take it as it is meant, a kind remembrance
Of a far kinder lord, with whose sad fall
He gives up house, and farewell to us all.
Thus the fair spreading oak falls not alone,
But all the neighbour plants and under-trees
Are crushed down with his weight. No more of this.
Come and receive your due, and after go
Fellow-like hence, co-partners of one woe.
