FIRST GAMEKEEPER Here comes a man—let’s stay till he be past. They stand apart. Enter King Henry, disguised, carrying a prayer-book From Scotland am I stolen, even of pure love,
To greet mine own land with my wishful sight.
No, Harry, Harry—’tis no land of thine.
Thy place is filled, thy sceptre wrung from thee,
Thy balm washed off wherewith thou wast anointed.
No bending knee will call thee Caesar now,
No humble suitors press to speak for right,
No, not a man comes for redress of thee—
For how can I help them and not myself?
