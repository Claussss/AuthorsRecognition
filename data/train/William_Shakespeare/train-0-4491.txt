PORTIA (to Bassanio) What ring gave you, my lord? Not that, I hope, which you received of me. If I could add a lie unto a fault
I would deny it; but you see my finger
Hath not the ring upon it. It is gone. Even so void is your false heart of truth. By heaven, I will neâ€™er come in your bed
Until I see the ring.
