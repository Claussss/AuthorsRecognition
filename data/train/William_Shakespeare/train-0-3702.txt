I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,
God save the mark, here on his manly breast—
A piteous corpse, a bloody, piteous corpse—
Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaubed in blood,
All in gore blood; I swooned at the sight. O, break, my heart, poor bankrupt, break at once!
To prison, eyes; ne’er look on liberty.
Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here,
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
