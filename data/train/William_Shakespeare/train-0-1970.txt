Enter Lord Stanley Earl of Derby STANLEY (kneeling) A boon, my sovereign, for my service done. KING EDWARD I pray thee, peace! My soul is full of sorrow. I will not rise, unless your highness hear me. KING EDWARD Then say at once, what is it thou requests? The forfeit, sovereign, of my servantâ€™s life,
Who slew today a riotous gentleman,
Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.
