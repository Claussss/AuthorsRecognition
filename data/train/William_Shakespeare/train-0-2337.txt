Love’s golden arrow at him should have fled,
And not death’s ebon dart to strike him dead. ‘Dost thou drink tears, that thou provok’st such weeping?
What may a heavy groan advantage thee?
Why hast thou cast into eternal sleeping
Those eyes that taught all other eyes to see? Now nature cares not for thy mortal vigour,
Since her best work is ruined with thy rigour.’
