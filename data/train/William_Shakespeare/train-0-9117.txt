She speaks apart with Macbeth
Are you a man? Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that
Which might appal the devil. LADY MACBETH O proper stuff! This is the very painting of your fear;
This is the air-drawn dagger which you said
Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,
Impostors to true fear, would well become
A woman’s story at a winter’s fire
Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself,
Why do you make such faces? When all’s done
You look but on a stool.
