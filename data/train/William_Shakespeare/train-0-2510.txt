His leaves will wither and his sap decay;
So must my soul, her bark being peeled away. â€˜Her house is sacked, her quiet interrupted,
Her mansion battered by the enemy,
Her sacred temple spotted, spoiled, corrupted,
Grossly engirt with daring infamy.
Then let it not be called impiety If in this blemished fort I make some hole
Through which I may convey this troubled soul.
