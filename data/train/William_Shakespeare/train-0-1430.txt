Prick not your finger as you pluck it off,
Lest, bleeding, you do paint the white rose red,
And fall on my side so against your will. If I, my lord, for my opinion bleed,
Opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt
And keep me on the side where still I am. SOMERSET Well, well, come on! Who else? Unless my study and my books be false,
The argument you held was wrong in law;
In sign whereof I pluck a white rose too.
