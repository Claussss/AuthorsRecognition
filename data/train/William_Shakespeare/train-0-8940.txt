TIMON What, a knave too? If thou didst put this sour cold habit on
To castigate thy pride, â€˜twere well; but thou
Dost it enforc
Wert thou not beggar. Willing misery
Outlives incertain pomp, is crowned before.
The one is filling still, never complete;
The other at high wish. Best state, contentless,
Hath a distracted and most wretched being,
Worse than the worst, content.
Thou shouldst desire to die, being miserable.
