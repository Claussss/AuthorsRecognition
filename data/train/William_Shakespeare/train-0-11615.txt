ALONSO I long To hear the story of your life, which must
Take the ear strangely. Iâ€™ll deliver all, And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales,
And sail so expeditious that shall catch
Your royal fleet far off. (Aside to Ariel) My Ariel, chick,
That is thy charge. Then to the elements
Be free, and fare thou well.
