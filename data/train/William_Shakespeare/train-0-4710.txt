Enter Prince Harry and the Earl of Westmorland PRINCE HARRY How now, blown Jack? How now, quilt? SIR JOHN What, Hal! How now, mad wag? What a devil dost thou in Warwickshire? My good lord of Westmorland, I cry you mercy! I thought your honour had already been at Shrewsbury. WESTMORLAND Faith, Sir John, â€™tis more than time that I were there, and you too; but my powers are there already. The King, I can tell you, looks for us all. We must away all night.
