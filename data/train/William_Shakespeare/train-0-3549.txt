GREGORY But thou art not quickly moved to strike. SAMSON A dog of the house of Montague moves me. GREGORY To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand, therefore if thou art moved, thou runn’st away. SAMSON A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague’s.
