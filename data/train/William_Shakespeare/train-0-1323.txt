RICHARD OF GLOUCESTER Think’st thou I am an executioner? A persecutor I am sure thou art;
If murdering innocents be executing,
Why, then thou art an executioner. RICHARD OF GLOUCESTER Thy son I killed for his presumption. Hadst thou been killed when first thou didst presume,
Thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine.
And thus I prophesy: that many a thousand
Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear,
And many an old man’s sigh, and many a widow‘s,
And many an orphan’s water-standing eye—
Men for their sons’, wives for their husbands‘,
Orphans for their parents’ timeless death—
Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born.
The owl shrieked at thy birth—an evil sign;
The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time;
Dogs howled, and hideous tempests shook down trees;
The raven rooked her on the chimney’s top;
And chatt’ring pies in dismal discords sung.
Thy mother felt more than a mother’s pain,
And yet brought forth less than a mother’s hope—
To wit, an indigested and deformed lump,
Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree.
Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born,
To signify thou cam‘st to bite the world;
And if the rest be true which I have heard
Thou cam’st—
