ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Thou art sensible in nothing but blows, and so is an ass. DROMIO OF EPHESUS I am an ass indeed. You may prove it by my long ears.â€”I have served him from the hour of my nativity to this instant, and have nothing at his hands for my service but blows. When I am cold, he heats me with beating. When I am warm, he cools me with beating. I am waked with it when I sleep, raised with it when I sit, driven out of doors with it when I go from home, welcomed home with it when I return. Nay, I bear it on my shoulders, as a beggar wont her brat, and I think when he hath lamed me I shall beg with it from door to door.
