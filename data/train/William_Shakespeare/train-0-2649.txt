COUNTESS OF SALISBURY All this is done, my thrice-dread sovereign.
That power of love that I have power to give
Thou hast, with all devout obedience.
Employ me how thou wilt in proof thereof. KING EDWARD Thou hear’st me say that I do dote on thee. COUNTESS OF SALISBURY If on my beauty, take it if thou canst;
Though little, I do prize it ten times less.
If on my virtue, take it if thou canst;
For virtue’s store, by giving, doth augment.
Be it on what it will that I can give,
And thou canst take away, inherit it.
