Exit Cardinal Beaufort assisted by Somerset What dares not Warwick, if false Suffolk dare him? QUEEN MARGARET He dares not calm his contumelious spirit,

Though Suffolk dare him twenty thousand times. Madam, be still, with reverence may I say,
For every word you speak in his behalf
Is slander to your royal dignity.
