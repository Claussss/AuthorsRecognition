QUEEN PHILIPPA But, Copland, thou didst scorn the King’s command,
Neglecting our commission in his name. His name I reverence, but his person more.
His name shall keep me in allegiance still,
But to his person I will bend my knee. KING EDWARD (to the Queen) I pray thee, Philip, let displeasure pass.
This man doth please me, and I like his words.
For what is he that will attempt great deeds
And lose the glory that ensues, the fame?
All rivers have recourse unto the sea,
And Copland’s faith, relation to his king.
(To Copland) Kneel therefore down.
