Daughters
kneel [To Daughters] God bless ye.—Son Roper, give me your
hand. Your honour’s welcome home. MORE Honour? Ha, ha! And how dost, wife? ROPER [aside] He bears himself most strangely. Will your lordship in? MORE Lordship? No, wife, that’s gone. The ground was slight that we did lean upon. Lord, that your honour ne’er will leave these jests!
In faith, it ill becomes ye.
