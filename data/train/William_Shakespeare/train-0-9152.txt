’Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word
Macduff is fled to England. Fled to England? LENNOX Ay, my good lord. MACBETH (aside) Time, thou anticipat‘st my dread exploits.
The flighty purpose never is o’ertook
Unless the deed go with it. From this moment
The very firstlings of my heart shall be
The firstlings of my hand. And even now,
To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and
done: 165
The castle of Macduff I will surprise,
Seize upon Fife, give to th‘edge o’th’ sword
His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls
That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool;
This deed I’ll do before this purpose cool.
But no more sights! (To Lennox) Where are these
gentlemen?
Come bring me where they are.
