CASSIO To the health of our general! MONTANO I am for it, lieutenant, and I’ll do you justice. IAGO O sweet England! King Stephen was and a worthy peer, His breeches cost him but a crown;
He held them sixpence all too dear,
With that he called the tailor lown.
He was a wight of high renown,
And thou art but of low degree.
’Tis pride that pulls the country down,
Then take thy auld cloak about thee.
