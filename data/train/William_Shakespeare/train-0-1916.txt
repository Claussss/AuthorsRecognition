LORD HASTINGS False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,
Lest to thy harm thou move our patience. QUEEN MARGARET Foul shame upon you, you have all moved mine. Were you well served, you would be taught your duty. QUEEN MARGARET To serve me well you all should do me duty.
Teach me to be your queen, and you my subjects:
O serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty.
