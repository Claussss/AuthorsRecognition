EVANS A lousy knave, to have his gibes and his mockeries.

Enter Master Fenton and Anne Page I see I cannot get thy father’s love;
Therefore no more turn me to him, sweet Nan. Alas, how then? FENTON Why, thou must be thyself. He doth object I am too great of birth,
And that, my state being galled with my expense,
I seek to heal it only by his wealth.
Besides these, other bars he lays before me—
My riots past, my wild societies;
And tells me ’tis a thing impossible
I should love thee but as a property.
