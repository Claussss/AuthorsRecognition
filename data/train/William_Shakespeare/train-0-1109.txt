PRINCE EDWARD (rising) My gracious father, by your kingly leave,
I’ll draw it as apparent to the crown,
And in that quarrel use it to the death. Why, that is spoken like a toward prince. Enter a Messenger Royal commanders, be in readiness—
For with a band of thirty thousand men
Comes Warwick backing of the Duke of York;
And in the towns, as they do march along,
Proclaims him king, and many fly to him.
Darraign your battle, for they are at hand.
