The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.
An evil soul producing holy witness
Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,
A goodly apple rotten at the heart.
O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath! Three thousand ducats. ’Tis a good round sum.
Three months from twelve—then let me see the rate. Well, Shylock, shall we be beholden to you?
