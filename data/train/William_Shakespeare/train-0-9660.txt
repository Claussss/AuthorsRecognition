HELEN (to another Lord) The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes,
Before I speak, too threatâ€™ningly replies.
Love make your fortunes twenty times above
Her that so wishes, and her humble love. SECOND LORD No better, if you please. My wish receive, Which great Love grant. And so I take my leave.
