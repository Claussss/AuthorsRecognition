I pray you, sir, take patience. I have hope
You less know how to value her desert
Than she to slack her duty. LEAR My curses on her. REGAN O sir, you are old. Nature in you stands on the very verge
Of her confine. You should be ruled and led
By some discretion that discerns your state
Better than you yourself. Therefore I pray
That to our sister you do make return;
Say you have wronged her, sir.
