KING SIMONIDES (to the knights) To say you’re welcome were superfluous.
To place upon the volume of your deeds
As in a title page your worth in arms
Were more than you expect, or more than’s fit,
Since every worth in show commends itself.
Prepare for mirth, for mirth becomes a feast.
You’re princes, and my guests.
