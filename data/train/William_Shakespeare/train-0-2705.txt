FRENCHMAN WITHOUT BAGGAGE Content thee, man, they are far enough from hence,
And will be met, I warrant ye, to their cost,
Before they break so far into the realm. FIRST FRENCHMAN WITH BAGGAGE Ay, so the grasshopper doth spend the time
In mirthful jollity, till winter come,
And then, too late, he would redeem his time,
When frozen cold hath nipped his careless head.
He that no sooner will provide a cloak
Than when he sees it doth begin to rain
May, peradventure, for his negligence,
Be throughly washed when he suspects it not.
We that have charge, and such a train as this,
Must look in time to look for them and us,
Lest, when we would, we cannot be relieved.
