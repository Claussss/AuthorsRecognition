FIRST SERVINGMAN Ay, and the very parings of our nails
Shall pitch a field when we are dead. They begin to skirmish again GLOUCESTER Stay, stay, I say! An if you love me as you say you do,
Let me persuade you to forbear a while. O how this discord doth afflict my soul!
Can you, my lord of Winchester, behold o
My sighs and tears, and will not once relent?
Who should be pitiful if you be not?
Or who should study to prefer a peace,
If holy churchmen take delight in broils?
