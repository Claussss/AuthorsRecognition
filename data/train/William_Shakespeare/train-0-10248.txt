I had rather have my wounds to heal again Than hear say how I got them. Sir, I hope My words disbenched you not? CORIOLANUS No, sir, yet oft When blows have made me stay I fled from words.
You soothed not, therefore hurt not; but your people,
I love them as they weigh— MENENIUS Pray now, sit down. I had rather have one scratch my head i’th’ sun
When the alarum were struck than idly sit
To hear my nothings monstered.
