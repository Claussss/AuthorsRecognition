Are on the sudden wasted, thawed, and done,
As mountain snow melts with the midday sun. â€˜Therefore, despite of fruitless chastity,
Love-lacking vestals and self-loving nuns,
That on the earth would breed a scarcity
And barren dearth of daughters and of sons, Be prodigal. The lamp that burns by night
Dries up his oil to lend the world his light.
