Mum, mum. He that keeps neither crust nor crumb,
Weary of all, shall want some. Thatâ€™s a shelled peascod. GONORIL (to Lear) Not only, sir, this your all-licensed fool,
But other of your insolent retinue
Do hourly carp and quarrel, breaking forth
In rank and not-to-be-endured riots.
Sir, I had thought by making this well known unto
you
To have found a safe redress, but now grow fearful,
By what yourself too late have spoke and done,
That you protect this course, and put it on
By your allowance; which if you should, the fault
Would not scape censure, nor the redress sleep
Which in the tender of a wholesome weal
Might in their working do you that offence,
That else were shame, that then necessity
Must call discreet proceedings.
