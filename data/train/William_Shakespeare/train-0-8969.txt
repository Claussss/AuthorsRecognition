POET What have you now to present unto him? PAINTER Nothing at this time, but my visitation; only I will promise him an excellent piece. POET I must serve him so too, tell him of an intent that’s coming toward him. PAINTER Good as the best.

Performance is a kind of will or testament which argues a great sickness in his judgement that makes it.
