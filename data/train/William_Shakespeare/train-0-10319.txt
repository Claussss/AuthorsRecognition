I’ll bring him to you. (To the Senators) Let me desire your company. He must
come,
Or what is worst will follow. Pray you, let’s to him. Exeunt tribunes and Citizens at one door,
Patricians at another door 3.2
Enter Coriolanus, with Nobles 
CORIOLANUS Let them pull all about mine ears, present me
Death on the wheel or at wild horses’ heels,
Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,
That the precipitation might down stretch
Below the beam of sight, yet will I still
Be thus to them.
