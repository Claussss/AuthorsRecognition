Wherein, and what taxation? My lord Cardinal,
You that are blamed for it alike with us,
Know you of this taxation? CARDINAL WOLSEY Please you, sir, I know but of a single part in aught
Pertains to th’ state, and front but in that file
Where others tell steps with me. QUEEN KATHERINE No, my lord? You know no more than others? But you frame
Things that are known alike, which are not wholesome
To those which would not know them, and yet must
Perforce be their acquaintance. These exactions
Whereof my sovereign would have note, they are
Most pestilent to th’ hearing, and to bear ’em
The back is sacrifice to th’ load. They say
They are devised by you, or else you suffer
Too hard an exclamation.
