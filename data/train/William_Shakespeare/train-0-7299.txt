TROILUS Who should withhold me? Not fate, obedience, nor the hand of Mars
Beckâ€˜ning with fiery truncheon my retire,
Not Priamus and Hecuba on knees,
Their eyes o
Nor you, my brother, with your true sword drawn
Opposed to hinder me, should stop my way
But by my ruin. Enter Priam and Cassandra Lay hold upon him, Priam, hold him fast.
He is thy crutch: now if thou loose thy stay,
Thou on him leaning and all Troy on thee,
Fall all together.
