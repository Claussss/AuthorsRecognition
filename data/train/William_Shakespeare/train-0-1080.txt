NORTHUMBERLAND Yield to our mercy, proud Plantagenet. Ay, to such mercy as his ruthless arm,
With downright payment, showed unto my father.
Now Phaeton hath tumbled from his car,
And made an evening at the noontide prick. My ashes, as the phoenix, may bring forth
A bird that will revenge upon you all,
And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven,
Scorning whate’er you can afflict me with.
Why come you not? What—multitudes, and fear?
