ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Go, hie thee presently. Post to the road.
An if the wind blow any way from shore,
I will not harbour in this town tonight.
If any barque put forth, come to the mart,
Where I will walk till thou return to me.
If everyone knows us, and we know none,
â€™Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack, and be gone.
