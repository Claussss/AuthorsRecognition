I will be welcome, then. Conduct me thither. Hear me, dear lady. I have sworn an oath— Our Lady help my lord He’ll be forsworn. Not for the world, fair madam, by my will. Why, will shall break it—will and nothing else. Your ladyship is ignorant what it is. Were my lord so his ignorance were wise,
Where now his knowledge must prove ignorance.
I hear your grace hath sworn out housekeeping.
’Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,
And sin to break it.
But pardon me, I am too sudden-bold.
To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me.
Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming,
And suddenly resolve me in my suit.
