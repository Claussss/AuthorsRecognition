FRIAR LAURENCE Hence from Verona art thou banished.
Be patient, for the world is broad and wide. There is no world without Verona walls
But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
Hence banished is banished from the world,
And world
Is death mistermed. Calling death 
Thou cutt‘st my head off with a golden axe,
And smil’st upon the stroke that murders me.
