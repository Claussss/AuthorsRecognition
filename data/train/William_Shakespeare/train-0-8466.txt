BURGUNDY Royal Lear, Give but that portion which yourself proposed,
And here I take Cordelia by the hand,
Duchess of Burgundyâ€” LEAR Nothing. I have sworn. BURGUNDY (to Cordelia) I am sorry, then, you have so lost a father
That you must lose a husband. Peace be with Burgundy; since that respects
Of fortune are his love, I shall not be his wife.
