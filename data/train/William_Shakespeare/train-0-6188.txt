DUKE FREDERICK Ay, Celia, we stayed her for your sake,
Else had she with her father ranged along. I did not then entreat to have her stay.
It was your pleasure, and your own remorse.
I was too young that time to value her,
But now I know her. If she be a traitor,
Why, so am I. We still have slept together,
Rose at an instant, learned, played, eat together,
And wheresoe’er we went, like Juno’s swans
Still we went coupled and inseparable.
