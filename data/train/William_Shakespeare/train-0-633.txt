The moon?—the sun. It is not moonlight now. I say it is the moon that shines so bright. I know it is the sun that shines so bright. 5 Now, by my mother’s son—and that’s myself—
It shall be moon, or star, or what I list
Or ere I journey to your father’s house.
Go on, and fetch our horses back again.
Evermore crossed and crossed, nothing but crossed.
