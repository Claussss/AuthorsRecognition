FOOL He that has a house to put ’s head in has a good head-piece. The codpiece that will house
 Before the head has any,
The head and he shall louse,
So beggars marry many.
The man that makes his toe
What he his heart should make
Shall of a corn cry woe,
And turn his sleep to wake—  for there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths in a glass.
