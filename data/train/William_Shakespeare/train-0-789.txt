GLOUCESTER Ambitious churchman, leave to afflict my heart.
Sorrow and grief have vanquished all my powers,
And, vanquished as I am, I yield to thee
Or to the meanest groom. O God, what mischiefs work the wicked ones,
Heaping confusion on their own heads thereby! QUEEN MARGARET Gloucester, see here the tainture of thy nest,
And look thyself be faultless, thou wert best.
