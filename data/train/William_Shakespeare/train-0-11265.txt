GUIDERIUS (to Belarius and Arviragus) Go you to hunting. I’ll abide with him. So sick I am not, yet I am not well;
But not so citizen a wanton as
To seem to die ere sick. So please you, leave me.
Stick to your journal course. The breach of custom
Is breach of all. I am ill, but your being by me
Cannot amend me. Society is no comfort
To one not sociable. I am not very sick,
Since I can reason of it. Pray you, trust me here.
I’ll rob none but myself; and let me die,
Stealing so poorly.
