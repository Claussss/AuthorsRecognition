NORTHUMBERLAND (to Hotspur) Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool
Art thou to break into this woman’s mood,
Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own I Why, look you, I am whipped and scourged with rods,
Nettled and stung with pismires, when I hear
Of this vile politician Bolingbroke.
In Richard’s time—what d‘ye call the place?
A plague upon’t, it is in Gloucestershire.
‘Twas where the madcap Duke his uncle kept—
His uncle York—where I first bowed my knee
Unto this king of smiles, this Bolingbroke.
’Sblood, when you and he came back from
Ravenspurgh.
