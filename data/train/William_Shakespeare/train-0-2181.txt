Upon my life, my lord, I’ll undertake it.
And so God give you quiet rest tonight. HENRY EARL OF RICHMOND Good night, good Captain Blunt. Come, gentlemen. Give me some ink and paper in my tent.
I’ll draw the form and model of our battle,
Limit each leader to his several charge,
And part in just proportion our small power.
Let us consult upon tomorrow’s business.
Into my tent: the dew is raw and cold.
