Not yet. The carts stand ready at the stairs,
And they shall presently away to Tyburn. Stay, Master Sheriff. It is the Councilâ€™s pleasure,
For more example in so bad a case,
A gibbet be erected in Cheapside
Hard by the Standard, whither you must bring
Lincoln, and those that were the chief with him,
To suffer death, and that immediately.
