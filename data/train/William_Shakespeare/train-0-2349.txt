No flower was nigh, no grass, herb, leaf, or weed,
But stole his blood, and seemed with him to bleed. This solemn sympathy poor Venus noteth.
Over one shoulder doth she hang her head.
Dumbly she passions, franticly she doteth.
She thinks he could not die, he is not dead. Her voice is stopped, her joints forget to bow,
Her eyes are mad that they have wept till now.
