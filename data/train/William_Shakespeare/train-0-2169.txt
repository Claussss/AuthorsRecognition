KING RICHARD Away, towards Salisbury! While we reason here,
A royal battle might be won and lost.
Someone take order Buckingham be brought
To Salisbury. The rest march on with me. Flourish. Exeunt 4.5
Enter Lord Stanley Earl of Derby and Sir Christopher, a priest Sir Christopher, tell Richmond this from me:
That in the sty of this most deadly boar
My son George Stanley is franked up in hold.
If I revolt, off goes young Georgeâ€™s head.
The fear of that holds off my present aid.
But tell me, where is princely Richmond now?
