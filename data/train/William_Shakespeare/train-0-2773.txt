Enter a Herald from Prince Philippe, carrying a book THIRD HERALD Edward of Wales, Philippe, the second son
To the most mighty Christian King of France,
Seeing thy bodyâ€™s living date expired,
All full of charity and Christian love He offers the book to the Prince Commends this book full fairly fraught with prayers
To thy fair hand, and for thy hour of life
Entreats thee that thou meditate therein,
And arm thy soul for her long journey towards.
Thus have I done his bidding and return.
