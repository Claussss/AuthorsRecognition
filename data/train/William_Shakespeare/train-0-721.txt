This they have promis
A spirit raised from depth of underground
That shall make answer to such questions
As by your Grace shall be propounded him. It is enough. I’ll think upon the questions.
When from Saint Albans we do make return,
We’ll see these things effected to the full.
Here, Hume (giving him money), take this reward.
Make merry, man,
With thy confederates in this weighty cause.
