PRINCE JOHN Health, peace, and happiness to my royal father! Thou bringâ€™st me happiness and peace, son John;
But health, alack, with youthful wings is flown
From this bare withered trunk. Upon thy sight
My worldly business makes a period.
Where is my lord of Warwick? PRINCE HARRY My lord of Warwick!
