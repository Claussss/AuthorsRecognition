This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood.
The words expressly are ‘a pound of flesh’.
Take then thy bond. Take thou thy pound of flesh.
But in the cutting it, if thou dost shed
One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods
Are by the laws of Venice confiscate
Unto the state of Venice. GRAZIANO O upright judge!
