ALL THE CITIZENS Come, come, let’s see him out at gates. Come.
 The gods preserve our noble tribunes! Come. Exeunt 4.1
Enter Coriolanus, Volumnia, Virgilia, Menenius, and Cominius, with the young nobility of Rome 
CORIOLANUS Come, leave your tears. A brief farewell. The beast
With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,
Where is your ancient courage? You were used
To say extremities was the trier of spirits,
That common chances common men could bear,
That when the sea was calm all boats alike
Showed mastership in floating; fortune’s blows
When most struck home, being gentle wounded craves
A noble cunning. You were used to load me
With precepts that would make invincible
The heart that conned them.
