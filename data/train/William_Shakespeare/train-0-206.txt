And thither will I bring thee, Valentine. Sweet Proteus, no. Now let us take our leave.
To Milan let me hear from thee by letters
Of thy success in love, and what news else
Betideth here in absence of thy friend;
And I likewise will visit thee with mine. All happiness bechance to thee in Milan. As much to you at home; and so farewell. Exit
