Exeunt Othello and Desdemona RODERIGO Iago. IAGO What sayst thou, noble heart? RODERIGO What will I do, thinkâ€™st thou? IAGO Why, go to bed and sleep. RODERIGO I will incontinently drown myself. IAGO If thou dost, I shall never love thee after. Why, thou silly gentleman! RODERIGO It is silliness to live when to live is torment; and then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician.
