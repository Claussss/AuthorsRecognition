Low march within  But when they should endure the bloody spur,
They fall their crests and, like deceitful jades,
Sink in the trial. Comes his army on? They mean this night in Sardis to be quartered.
The greater part, the horse in general,
Are come with Cassius.
Enter Cassius and his powers BRUTUS Hark, he is arrived.
