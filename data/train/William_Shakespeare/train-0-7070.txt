AGAMEMNON Speak frankly as the wind. It is not Agamemnonâ€™s sleeping hour.
That thou shalt know, Trojan, he is awake,
He tells thee so himself. AENEAS Trumpet, blow loud. Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents,
And every Greek of mettle let him know
What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud.
