At this Adonis smiles as in disdain,
That in each cheek appears a pretty dimple.
Love made those hollows, if himself were slain,
He might be buried in a tomb so simple, Foreknowing well, if there he came to lie,
Why, there love lived, and there he could not die. These lovely caves, these round enchanting pits,
Opened their mouths to swallow Venusâ€™ liking.
Being mad before, how doth she now for wits?
Struck dead at first, what needs a second striking?
