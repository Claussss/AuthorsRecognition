I think not so, my lord. Dear lad, believe it;
For they shall yet belie thy happy years
That say thou art a man. Diana’s lip
Is not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipe
Is as the maiden’s organ, shrill and sound,
And all is semblative a woman’s part.
I know thy constellation is right apt
For this affair. (To Curio and attendants) Some four or
five attend him.
All if you will, for I myself am best
When least in company. (To Viola) Prosper well in this
And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,
To call his fortunes thine.
