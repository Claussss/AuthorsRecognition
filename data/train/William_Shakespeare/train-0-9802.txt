4.4
Enter Helen, the Widow, and Diana That you may well perceive I have not wronged you,
One of the greatest in the Christian world
Shall be my surety; fore whose throne ‘tis needful,
Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel.
Time was, I did him a desired office
Dear almost as his life; which gratitude
Through flinty Tartar’s bosom would peep forth
And answer ‘Thanks’. I duly am informed
His grace is at Marseilles, to which place
We have convenient convoy. You must know
I am supposed dead. The army breaking,
My husband hies him home, where, heaven aiding,
And by the leave of my good lord the King,
We’ll be before our welcome.
