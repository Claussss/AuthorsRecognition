Exeunt all but Ulysses and Nestor NESTOR What says Ulysses? ULYSSES I have a young Conception in my brain; be you my time
To bring it to some shape. NESTOR What is’t? ULYSSES This ’tis: Blunt wedges rive hard knots. The seeded pride
That hath to this maturity blown up
In rank Achilles must or now be cropped
Or, shedding, breed a nursery of like evil
To overbulk us all.
