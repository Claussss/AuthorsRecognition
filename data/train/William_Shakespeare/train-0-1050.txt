He rose against him, being his sovereign,
And made him to resign his crown perforce. Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrained—
Think you ’twere prejudicial to his crown? No, for he could not so resign his crown
But that the next heir should succeed and reign. Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter? His is the right, and therefore pardon me.
