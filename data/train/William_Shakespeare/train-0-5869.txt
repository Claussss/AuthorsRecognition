KING HARRY Fair Catherine, and most fair, Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms
Such as will enter at a ladyâ€™s ear
And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart? CATHERINE Your majesty shall mock at me. I cannot speak your England. KING HARRY O fair Catherine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?
