REGAN Prescribe not us our duty. GONERIL Let your study Be to content your lord, who hath received you
At fortuneâ€™s alms. You have obedience scanted,
And well are worth the want that you have wanted. Time shall unfold what pleated cunning hides,
Who covert faults at last with shame derides.
Well may you prosper.
