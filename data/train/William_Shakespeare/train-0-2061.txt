Yet had not we determined he should die,
Until your lordship came to see his end,
Which now the loving haste of these our friends—
Something against our meanings—have prevented;
Because, my lord, we would have had you hear
The traitor speak, and timorously confess
The manner and the purpose of his treason,
That you might well have signified the same
Unto the citizens, who haply may
Misconster us in him, and wail his death.
