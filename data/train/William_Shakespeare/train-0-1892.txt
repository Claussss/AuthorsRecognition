STANLEY (to Elizabeth) God make your majesty joyful, as you have been. QUEEN ELIZABETH The Countess Richmond, good my lord of Derby,
To your good prayer will scarcely say ‘Amen’.
Yet, Derby—notwithstanding she’s your wife,
And loves not me—be you, good lord, assured
I hate not you for her proud arrogance.
