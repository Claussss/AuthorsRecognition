SHERIFF Then let them come on foot. We may not dally time with great command. SECOND OFFICER Some of the Bench, sir, think it very fit
That stay be made, and give it out abroad
The execution is deferred till morning;
And when the streets shall be a little cleared
To chain them up, and suddenly dispatch it.
