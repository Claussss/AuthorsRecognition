DIONYZA As you think best, sir. This Tarsus o‘er which I have the government,
A city o’er whom plenty held full hand,
For riches strewed herself ev’n in the streets,
Whose tow‘rs bore heads so high they kissed the clouds,
And strangers ne’er beheld but wondered at,
Whose men and dames so jetted and adorned
Like one another’s glass to trim them by;
Their tables were stored full to glad the sight,
And not so much to feed on as delight.
All poverty was scorned, and pride so great
The name of help grew odious to repeat.
