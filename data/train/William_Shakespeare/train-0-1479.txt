My vows are equal partners with thy vows. But ere we go, regard this dying prince,
The valiant Duke of Bedford. (To Bedford) Come, my
lord,
We will bestow you in some better place,
Fitter for sickness and for crazy age. Lord Talbot, do not so dishonour me.
Here will I sit before the walls of Rouen,
And will be partner of your weal or woe.
