5.6 Flourish. Enter Cymbeline, Belarius, Guiderius, Arviragus, Pisanio, and lords 
CYMBELINE (to Belarius, Guiderius, and Arviragus) Stand by my side, you whom the gods have made
Preservers of my throne. Woe is my heart
That the poor soldier that so richly fought,
Whose rags shamed gilded arms, whose naked breast
Stepped before targs of proof, cannot be found.
He shall be happy that can find him, if
Our grace can make him so.
