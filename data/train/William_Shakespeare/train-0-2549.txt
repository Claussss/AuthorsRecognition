Here feelingly she weeps Troyâ€™s painted woes;
For sorrow, like a heavy hanging bell
Once set on ringing, with his own weight goes;
Then little strength rings out the doleful knell.
So Lucrece, set a-work, sad tales doth tell To pencilled pensiveness and coloured sorrow.
She lends them words, and she their looks doth
borrow.
