Enter John Rugby I pray thee, go to the casement and see if you can see
my master, Master Doctor Caius, coming. If he do,
i’faith, and find anybody in the house, here will be an
old abusing of God’s patience and the King’s English. RUGBY I’ll go watch. MISTRESS QUICKLY Go; and we’ll have a posset for’t soon at night, in faith, at the latter end of a seacoal fire.
