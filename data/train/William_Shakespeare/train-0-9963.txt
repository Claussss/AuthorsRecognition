Wrong not yourself, then, noble Helicane,
But if the prince do live, let us salute him
Or know what ground’s made happy by his step,
And be resolved he lives to govern us,
Or dead, give ’s cause to mourn his funeral
And leave us to our free election. SECOND LORD Whose death indeed’s the strongest in our censure,
And knowing this—kingdoms without a head,
Like goodly buildings left without a roof,
Soon fall to utter ruin—your noble self,
That best know how to rule and how to reign,
We thus submit unto as sovereign.
