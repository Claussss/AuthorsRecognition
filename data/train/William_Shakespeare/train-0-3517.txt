Good aunt, stand up. DUCHESS OF YORK Nay, do not say ‘Stand up’. Say ‘Pardon’ first, and afterwards ‘Stand up’.
An if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach,
‘Pardon’ should be the first word of thy speech.
I never longed to hear a word till now.
Say ‘Pardon’, King. Let pity teach thee how.
The word is short, but not so short as sweet;
No word like ’Pardon’ for kings’ mouths so meet.
