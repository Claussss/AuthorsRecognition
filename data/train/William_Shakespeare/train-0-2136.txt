KING RICHARD You have a daughter called Elizabeth,
Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious. QUEEN ELIZABETH And must she die for this? O let her live,
And I’ll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty,
Slander myself as false to Edward’s bed,
Throw over her the veil of infamy.
So she may live unscarred of bleeding slaughter,
I will confess she was not Edward’s daughter.
