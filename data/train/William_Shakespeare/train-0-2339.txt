But, like a stormy day, now wind, now rain,
Sighs dry her cheeks, tears make them wet again. Variable passions throng her constant woe,
As striving who should best become her grief.
All entertained, each passion labours so
That every present sorrow seemeth chief, But none is best. Then join they all together,
Like many clouds consulting for foul weather.
