Her hair like golden threads played with her breath—
O modest wantons, wanton modesty!—
Showing life’s triumph in the map of death,
And death’s dim look in life’s mortality.
Each in her sleep themselves so beautify As if between them twain there were no strife,
But that life lived in death, and death in life.
