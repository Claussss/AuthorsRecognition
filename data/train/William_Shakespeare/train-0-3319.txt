What is thy name? And wherefore com’st thou hither
Before King Richard in his royal lists?
Against whom comest thou? And what’s thy quarrel?
Speak like a true knight, so defend thee heaven! BOLINGBROKE Harry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby
Am I, who ready here do stand in arms
To prove by God’s grace and my body’s valour
In lists on Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,
That he is a traitor foul and dangerous
To God of heaven, King Richard, and to me.
And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!
