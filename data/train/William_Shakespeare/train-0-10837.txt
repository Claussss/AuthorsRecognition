Exit one or more Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,
More hideous when thou show’st thee in a child
Than the sea-monster— ALBANY Pray sir, be patient. LEAR (to Goneril) Detested kite, thou liest. My train are men of choice and rarest parts,
That all particulars of duty know,
And in the most exact regard support
The worships of their name. O most small fault,
How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show,
Which, like an engine, wrenched my frame of nature
From the fixed place, drew from my heart all love,
And added to the gall! O Lear, Lear, Lear!
Beat at this gate that let thy folly in
And thy dear judgement out.—Go, go, my people!
