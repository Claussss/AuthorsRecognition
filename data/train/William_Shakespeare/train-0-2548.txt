‘Lo, here weeps Hecuba, here Priam dies,
Here manly Hector faints, here Troilus swoons,
Here friend by friend in bloody channel lies,
And friend to friend gives unadvised wounds,
And one man’s lust these many lives confounds. Had doting Priam checked his son’s desire,
Troy had been bright with fame, and not with fire.’
