Enter Cleopatra  O Charmian, I will never go from hence. Be comforted, dear madam. No, I will not. All strange and terrible events are welcome,
But comforts we despise. Our size of sorrow,
Proportioned to our cause, must be as great
As that which makes it. Enter Diomedes  How now? Is he dead? His death’s upon him, but not dead.
Look out o’th’ other side your monument.
His guard have brought him thither.
