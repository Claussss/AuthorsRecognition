SECOND SENATOR Noble Aufidius, Take your commission, hie you to your bands.
Let us alone to guard Corioles.
If they set down before’s, for the remove
Bring up your army, but I think you’ll find
They’ve not prepared for us. O, doubt not that. I speak from certainties. Nay, more,
Some parcels of their power are forth already,
And only hitherward. I leave your honours.
If we and Caius Martius chance to meet,
’Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
Till one can do no more.
