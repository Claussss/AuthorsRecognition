Exeunt Surrey, Erasmus, and attendants How now, Master Morris? MORRIS I am a suitor to your lordship in behalf of a servant of mine. The fellow with long hair, good Master Morris?
Come to me three years hence, and then Iâ€™ll hear you. MORRIS I understand your honour; but the foolish knave has submitted himself to the mercy of a barber, and is without, ready to make a new vow before your lordship hereafter to live civil.
