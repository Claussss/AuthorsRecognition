He and Lavinia rise You heavy people, circle me about,
That I may turn me to each one of you
And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs. Marcus, Lucius, and Lavinia circle Titus. He
pledges them The vow is made. Come, brother, take a head,
And in this hand the other will I bear.
And Lavinia, thou shalt be employed.
Bear thou my hand, sweet wench, between thine arms.
As for thee, boy, go get thee from my sight.
Thou art an exile and thou must not stay.
Hie to the Goths, and raise an army there,
And if ye love me, as I think you do,
Letâ€™s kiss and part, for we have much to do.
