I am glad of this, for now I shall have reason
To show the love and duty that I bear you
With franker spirit. Therefore, as I am bound,
Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.
Look to your wife. Observe her well with Cassio.
Wear your eyes thus: not jealous, nor secure.
I would not have your free and noble nature
Out of self-bounty be abused. Look to’t.
I know our country disposition well.
In Venice they do let God see the pranks
They dare not show their husbands; their best
conscience
Is not to leave’t undone, but keep’t unknown.
