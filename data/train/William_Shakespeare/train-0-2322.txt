With this he breaketh from the sweet embrace
Of those fair arms which bound him to her breast,
And homeward through the dark laund runs apace,
Leaves love upon her back, deeply distressed. Look how a bright star shooteth from the sky,
So glides he in the night from Venusâ€™ eye, Which after him she darts, as one on shore
Gazing upon a late-embark
Till the wild waves will have him seen no more,
Whose ridges with the meeting clouds contend.
