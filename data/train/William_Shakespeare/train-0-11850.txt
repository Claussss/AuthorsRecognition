Madam, the same, bowing O, my lord, The times and titles now are altered strangely
With me since first you knew me. But I pray you,
What is your pleasure with me? Noble lady, First mine own service to your grace; the next,
The Kingâ€™s request that I would visit you,
Who grieves much for your weakness, and by me
Sends you his princely commendations,
And heartily entreats you take good comfort.
