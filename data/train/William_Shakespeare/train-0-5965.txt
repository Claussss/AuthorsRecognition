I am not well in health, and that is all. Brutus is wise, and were he not in health
He would embrace the means to come by it. Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed. Is Brutus sick? And is it physical
To walk unbrac
Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick?
And will he steal out of his wholesome bed
To dare the vile contagion of the night,
And tempt the rheumy and unpurg
To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus,
You have some sick offence within your mind,
Which by the right and virtue of my place
I ought to know of. (Kneeling) And upon my knees,
I charm you by my once-commended beauty,
By all your vows of love, and that great vow
Which did incorporate and make us one,
That you unfold to me, your self, your half,
Why you are heavy, and what men tonight
Have had resort to youâ€”for here have been
Some six or seven, who did hide their faces
Even from darkness.
