By many a dern and painful perch
Of Pericles the care-full search,
By the four opposing coigns
Which the world together joins,
Is made with all due diligence
That horse and sail and high expense
Can stead the quest. At last from Tyre
Fame answering the most strange enquire,
To th’ court of King Simonides
Are letters brought, the tenor these:
Antiochus and his daughter dead,
The men of Tyrus on the head
Of Helicanus would set on
The crown of Tyre, but he will none.
The mutiny there he hastes t‘appease,
Says to ’em if King Pericles
Come not home in twice six moons
He, obedient to their dooms,
Will take the crown. The sum of this
Brought hither to Pentapolis
Y-ravish
And everyone with claps can sound
‘Our heir-apparent is a king!
Who dreamt, who thought of such a thing?’
Brief he must hence depart to Tyre;
His queen with child makes her desire—
Which who shall cross?—along to go.
Omit we all their dole and woe.
Lychorida her nurse she takes,
And so to sea. Their vessel shakes
On Neptune’s billow. Half the flood
Hath their keel cut, but fortune’s mood
Varies again. The grizzled north
Disgorges such a tempest forth
That as a duck for life that dives,
So up and down the poor ship drives.
The lady shrieks, and well-a-near
Does fall in travail with her fear,
And what ensues in this fell storm
Shall for itself itself perform;
I nill relate; action may
Conveniently the rest convey,
Which might not what by me is told.
In your imagination hold
This stage the ship, upon whose deck
The sea-tossed Pericles appears to speke. Exit
