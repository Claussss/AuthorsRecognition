This said, from her betumbled couch she starteth,
To find some despâ€™rate instrument of death.
But this, no slaughterhouse, no tool imparteth
To make more vent for passage of her breath,
Which thronging through her lips so vanisheth As smoke from Etna that in air consumes,
Or that which from discharged cannon fumes.
