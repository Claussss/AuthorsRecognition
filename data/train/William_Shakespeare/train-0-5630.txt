reading from a scroll) Done to death by slanderous tongues
Was the Hero that here lies.
Death in guerdon of her wrongs
Gives her fame which never dies.
So the life that died with shame
Lives in death with glorious fame. He hangs the epitaph on the tomb Hang thou there upon the tomb,
Praising her when I am dumb.
