But yet I love my country, and am not
One that rejoices in the common wrack
As common bruit doth put it. FIRST SENATOR That’s well spoke. Commend me to my loving countrymen— FIRST SENATOR These words become your lips as they pass through
them. SECOND SENATOR And enter in our ears like great triumphers
In their applauding gates.
