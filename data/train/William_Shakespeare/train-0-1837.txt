Enter some with Aaron You sad Andronici, have done with woes.
Give sentence on this execrable wretch
That hath been breeder of these dire events. Set him breast-deep in earth and famish him.
There let him stand, and rave, and cry for food.
If anyone relieves or pities him,
For the offence he dies. This is our doom.
Some stay to see him fastened in the earth.
