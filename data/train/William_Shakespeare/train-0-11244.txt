Enter Pisanio Who is here? What, are you packing, sirrah?
Come hither. Ah, you precious pander! Villain,
Where is thy lady? In a word, or else
Thou art straightway with the fiends. O good my lord! Where is thy lady?—or, by Jupiter,
I will not ask again. Close villain,
I’ll have this secret from thy tongue or rip
Thy heart to find it. Is she with Posthumus,
From whose so many weights of baseness cannot
A dram of worth be drawn?
