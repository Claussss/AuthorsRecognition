SIR TOBY Madam. Will it be ever thus? Ungracious wretch,
Fit for the mountains and the barbarous caves, Where manners ne’er were preached—out of my sight! Be not offended, dear Cesario. (To Sir Toby) Rudesby, be gone. Exeunt Sir Toby, Sir Andrew, and Fabian I prithee, gentle friend, Let thy fair wisdom, not thy passion sway
In this uncivil and unjust extent
Against thy peace. Go with me to my house,
And hear thou there how many fruitless pranks
This ruffian hath botched up, that thou thereby
Mayst smile at this. Thou shalt not choose but go.
Do not deny. Beshrew his soul for me,
He started one poor heart of mine in thee.
