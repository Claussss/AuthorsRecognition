Say, Earl of Suffolk—if thy name be so—
What ransom must I pay before I pass?
For I perceive I am thy prisoner. SUFFOLK (aside) How canst thou tell she will deny thy suit
Before thou make a trial of her love? Why speak’st thou not? What ransom must I pay? SUFFOLK (aside) She’s beautiful, and therefore to be wooed;
She is a woman, therefore to be won.
