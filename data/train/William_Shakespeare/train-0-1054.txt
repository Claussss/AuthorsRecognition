My lord of Warwick, hear me but one word—
Let me for this my lifetime reign as king. Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,
And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou liv’st. I am content. Richard Plantagenet,
Enjoy the kingdom after my decease. What wrong is this unto the prince your son? What good is this to England and himself?
