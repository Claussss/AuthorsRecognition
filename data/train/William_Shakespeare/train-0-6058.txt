Lucillius, do you the like; and let no man
Come to our tent till we have done our conference.
Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door. Exeunt the armies Brutus and Cassius remain, with Titinius, and Lucius guarding the door That you have wronged me doth appear in this:
You have condemned and noted Lucius Pella
For taking bribes here of the Sardians,
Wherein my letters praying on his side,
Because I knew the man, was slighted off.
