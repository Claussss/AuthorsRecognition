Have thou the ordering of this present time. Away, then, with good courage! Aside
Our party may well meet a prouder foe. Exeunt 5.2
Enter,  
LOUIS THE DAUPHIN My Lord Melun, let this be copied out,
And keep it safe for our remembrance.
Return the precedent to these lords again,
That having our fair order written down,
Both they and we, perusing oâ€™er these notes,
May know wherefore we took the sacrament
And keep our faiths firm and inviolable.
