PARIS To a hair. PANDARUS Farewell, sweet Queen. HELEN Commend me to your niece. PANDARUS I will, sweet Queen. Exit Sound a retreat They’re come from field. Let us to Priam’s hall
To greet the warriors. Sweet Helen, I must woo you
To help unarm our Hector. His stubborn buckles,
With these your white enchanting fingers touched,
Shall more obey than to the edge of steel
Or force of Greekish sinews. You shall do more
Than all the island kings: disarm great Hector.
