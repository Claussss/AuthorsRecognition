5.1
Enter Menenius, Cominius, Sicinius and Brutus, the two tribunes, with others No, I’ll not go. You hear what he hath said
Which was sometime his general, who loved him
In a most dear particular. He called me father,
But what o’ that? (To the tribunes) Go, you that
banished him.
A mile before his tent fall down, and knee
The way into his mercy. Nay, if he coyed
To hear Cominius speak, I’ll keep at home.
