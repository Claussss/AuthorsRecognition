Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
All slain, all dead. 
There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
In that word’s death. No words can that woe sound.
Where is my father and my mother, Nurse? Weeping and wailing over Tybalt’s corpse.
Will you go to them? I will bring you thither. Wash they his wounds with tears; mine shall be spent
When theirs are dry, for Romeo’s banishment.
Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguiled,
Both you and I, for Romeo is exiled.
He made you for a highway to my bed,
But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
Come, cords; come, Nurse; I’ll to my wedding bed,
And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
