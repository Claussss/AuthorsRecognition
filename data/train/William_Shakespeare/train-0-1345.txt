Cease, cease these jars, and rest your minds in peace.
Let’s to the altar. Heralds, wait on us. Exeunt Warwick, Somerset, and heralds with coffin Instead of gold, we’ll offer up our arms—
Since arms avail not, now that Henry’s dead.
Posterity, await for wretched years,
When, at their mothers’ moistened eyes, babes shall suck,
Our isle be made a marish of salt tears,
And none but women left to wail the dead.
Henry the Fifth, thy ghost I invocate:
Prosper this realm; keep it from civil broils;
Combat with adverse planets in the heavens.
A far more glorious star thy soul will make
Than Julius Caesar or bright—
