This is another prisoner that I saved,
Who should have died when Claudio lost his head,
As like almost to Claudio as himself.
He unmuffles Claudio DUKE (to Isabella) If he be like your brother, for his sake
Is he pardoned; and for your lovely sake
Give me your hand, and say you will be mine.
He is my brother too. But fitter time for that.
By this Lord Angelo perceives he’s safe.
Methinks I see a quick’ning in his eye.
Well, Angelo, your evil quits you well.
Look that you love your wife, her worth worth yours.
I find an apt remission in myself;
And yet here’s one in place I cannot pardon.
(To Lucio) You, sirrah, that knew me for a fool, a
coward,
One all of luxury, an ass, a madman,
Wherein have I so deserved of you
That you extol me thus?
