I come, anon. (To Romeo) But if thou mean’st not well,
I do beseech thee— (within) Madam! JULIET By and by I come.— To cease thy strife and leave me to my grief.
Tomorrow will I send. ROMEO So thrive my soul— JULIET A thousand times good night. Exit A thousand times the worse to want thy light.
Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books,
But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
