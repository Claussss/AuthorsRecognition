Profane fellow, Wert thou the son of Jupiter, and no more
But what thou art besides, thou wert too base
To be his groom; thou wert dignified enough,
Even to the point of envy, if â€™twere made
Comparative for your virtues to be styled
The under-hangman of his kingdom, and hated
For being preferred so well.
