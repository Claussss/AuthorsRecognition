VIRGILIA O heavens, O heavens! CORIOLANUS Nay, I prithee, woman— Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,
 And occupations perish! CORIOLANUS What, what, what? I shall be loved when I am lacked. Nay, mother,
Resume that spirit when you were wont to say,
If you had been the wife of Hercules
Six of his labours you’d have done, and saved
Your husband so much sweat. Cominius,
Droop not. Adieu. Farewell, my wife, my mother.
I’ll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,
Thy tears are salter than a younger man‘s,
And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime general,
I have seen thee stern, and thou hast oft beheld
Heart-hard’ning spectacles. Tell these sad women
‘Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes
As ’tis to laugh at ’em. My mother, you wot well
My hazards still have been your solace, and—
Believe’t not lightly—though I go alone,
Like to a lonely dragon that his fen
Makes feared and talked of more than seen, your son
Will or exceed the common or be caught
With cautelous baits and practice.
