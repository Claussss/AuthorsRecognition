SECOND SUPPLICANT The sun, dread lord, that in the western fall
Beholds us now low-brought through misery,
Did, in the orient purple of the morn,
Salute our coming forth when we were known Or may our portion be with damned fiends. KING EDWARD If it be so, then let our covenant stand.
We take possession of the town in peace,
But for yourselves, look you for no remorse.
But, as imperial justice hath decreed,
Your bodies shall be dragged about these walls,
And, after, feel the stroke of quartering steel.
This is your doom. (To the soldiers) Go, soldiers, see it
done.
