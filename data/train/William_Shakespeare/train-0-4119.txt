What earthy name to interrogatories
Can task the free breath of a sacred king?
Thou canst not, Cardinal, devise a name 75
So slight, unworthy, and ridiculous
To charge me to an answer, as the Pope.
Tell him this tale, and from the mouth of England
Add thus much more: that no Italian priest
Shall tithe or toll in our dominions; 80
But as we, under God, are supreme head,
So, under him, that great supremacy
Where we do reign we will alone uphold
Without thâ€™assistance of a mortal hand.
So tell the Pope, all reverence set apart
To him and his usurped authority.
