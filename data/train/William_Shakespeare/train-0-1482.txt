Cowardly knight, ill fortune follow thee! Exit Retreat. Excursions. Joan, Alen Now, quiet soul, depart when heaven please,
For I have seen our enemies’ overthrow.
What is the trust or strength of foolish man?
They that of late were daring with their scoffs
Are glad and fain by flight to save themselves.
