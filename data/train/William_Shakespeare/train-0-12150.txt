Do you think he’ll have me? Yes, without doubt. JAILER’S DAUGHTER (to the Jailer) Do you think so too? JAILER Yes. JAILER’S DAUGHTER We shall have many children. To the Doctor
how you’re grown!
My Palamon, I hope, will grow too, finely,
Now he’s at liberty. Alas, poor chicken,
He was kept down with hard meat and ill lodging,
But I’ll kiss him up again.
