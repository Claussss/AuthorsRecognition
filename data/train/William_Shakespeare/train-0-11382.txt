Not too hot. First pay me for the nursing of thy sons,
And let it be confiscate all so soon
As I have received it. Nursing of my sons? I am too blunt and saucy. (Kneeling) Hereâ€™s my knee.
Ere I arise I will prefer my sons,
Then spare not the old father. Mighty sir,
These two young gentlemen that call me father
And think they are my sons are none of mine.
They are the issue of your loins, my liege,
And blood of your begetting.
