And pawn mine honour for their safety; since
My lord hath interest in them, I will keep them
In my bedchamber. They are in a trunk Attended by my men. I will make bold
To send them to you, only for this night.
I must aboard tomorrow. Yes, I beseech, or I shall short my word
By lengthâ€™ning my return. From Gallia
I crossed the seas on purpose and on promise
To see your grace.
