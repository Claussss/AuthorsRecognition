PIRITHOUS (to Arcite) I’ll see you furnished, and, because you say
You are a horseman, I must needs entreat you
This afternoon to ride—but ’tis a rough one. I like him better, prince—I shall not then
Freeze in my saddle. THESEUS (to Hippolyta) Sweet, you must be ready
all,
Tomorrow by the sun, to do observance
To flow’ry May in Dian’s wood. (To Arcite) Wait well,
sir,
Upon your mistress.—Emity, I hope
He shall not go afoot.
