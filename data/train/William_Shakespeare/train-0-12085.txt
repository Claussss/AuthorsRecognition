PALAMON and ARCITE With all our souls. He that she refuses Must die, then. PALAMON and ARCITE Any death thou canst invent, Duke. If I fall from that mouth, I fall with favour,
And lovers yet unborn shall bless my ashes. If she refuse me, yet my grave will wed me,
And soldiers sing my epitaph. THESEUS (to Emilia)
