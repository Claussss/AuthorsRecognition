My lord, I’ll yield myself to prison willingly,
Or unto death, to do my country good. KING HENRY (to Buckingham) In any case, be not too rough in terms,
For he is fierce and cannot brook hard language. I will, my lord, and doubt not so to deal
As all things shall redound unto your good. Come, wife, let’s in and learn to govern better;
For yet may England curse my wretched reign.
