This discipline shows thou hast been in love. And thy advice this night Iâ€™ll put in practice.
Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver,
Let us into the city presently
To sort some gentlemen well skilled in music.
I have a sonnet that will serve the turn
To give the onset to thy good advice. DUKE About it, gentlemen.
