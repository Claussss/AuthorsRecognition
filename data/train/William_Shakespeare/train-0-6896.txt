SIR TOBY Come bring us, bring us where he is. Exeunt  3.3
Enter Sebastian and Antonio I would not by my will have troubled you,
But since you make your pleasure of your pains
I will no further chide you. I could not stay behind you. My desire,
More sharp than fil
And not all love to see you—though so much
As might have drawn one to a longer voyage—
But jealousy what might befall your travel,
Being skilless in these parts, which to a stranger,
Unguided and unfriended, often prove
Rough and unhospitable. My willing love
The rather by these arguments of fear
Set forth in your pursuit.
