RICHARD GLOUCESTER Then be it so, and go we to determine
Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow.—
Madam, and you my sister, will you go
To give your censures in this weighty business? QUEEN ELIZABETH and DUCHESS OF YORK With all our hearts. Exeunt all but Richard and Buckingham My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,
For God’s sake let not us two stay at home,
For by the way I’ll sort occasion,
As index to the story we late talked of,
To part the Queen’s proud kindred from the Prince.
