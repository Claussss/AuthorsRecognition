Enter on the wallsa French Sergeant of a band, with two Sentinels Sirs, take your places and be vigilant.
If any noise or soldier you perceive
Near to the walls, by some apparent sign
Let us have knowledge at the court of guard. Sergeant, you shall. Exit Sergeant Thus are poor servitors, When others sleep upon their quiet beds,
Constrained to watch in darkness, rain, and cold.
