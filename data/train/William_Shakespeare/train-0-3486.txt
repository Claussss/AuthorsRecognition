Enter the Earl of Northumberland NORTHUMBERLAND My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is changed.
You must to Pomfret, not unto the Tower.
And, madam, there is order ta’en for you.
With all swift speed you must away to France. Northumberland, thou ladder wherewithal
The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne,
The time shall not be many hours of age
More than it is ere foul sin, gathering head,
Shall break into corruption. Thou shalt think,
Though he divide the realm and give thee half,
It is too little helping him to all.
He shall think that thou, which know‘st the way
To plant unrightful kings, wilt know again,
Being ne’er so little urged another way,
To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne.
The love of wicked friends converts to fear,
That fear to hate, and hate turns one or both
To worthy danger and deserved death.
