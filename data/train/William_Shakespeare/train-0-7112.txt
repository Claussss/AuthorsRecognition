THERSITES Thy commander, Achilles.—Then tell me, Patroclus, what’s Achilles? PATROCLUS Thy lord, Thersites. Then tell me, I pray thee, what’s Thersites? THERSITES Thy knower, Patroclus. Then tell me, Patroclus, what art thou? PATROCLUS Thou mayst tell, that knowest. ACHILLES O tell, tell. THERSITES I’ll decline the whole question. Agamemnon commands Achilles, Achilles is my lord, I am Patroclus’ knower, and Patroclus is a fool.
