Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Emilia, and Arcite in a chair borne by attendants O miserable end of our alliance!
The gods are mighty. Arcite, if thy heart,
Thy worthy manly heart, be yet unbroken,
Give me thy last words. I am Palamon,
One that yet loves thee dying. Take Emilia,
 And with her all the world’s joy. Reach thy hand—
Farewell—I have told my last hour. I was false,
Yet never treacherous. Forgive me, cousin—
One kiss from fair Emilia—(they kiss) ’tis done.
Take her; I die.
