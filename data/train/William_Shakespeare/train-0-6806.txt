OLIVIA You might do much. What is your parentage? Above my fortunes, yet my state is well.
I am a gentleman. Get you to your lord.
I cannot love him. Let him send no more,
Unless, perchance, you come to me again
To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well.
I thank you for your pains. (Offering a purse) Spend
this for me.
