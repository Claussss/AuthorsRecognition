JOHN OF GAUNT Thy grief is but thy absence for a time. BOLINGBROKE Joy absent, grief is present for that time. JOHN OF GAUNT What is six winters? They are quickly gone. BOLINGBROKE To men in joy, but grief makes one hour ten. JOHN OF GAUNT Call it a travel that thou takâ€™st for pleasure. BOLINGBROKE My heart will sigh when I miscall it so,
Which finds it an enforced pilgrimage.
