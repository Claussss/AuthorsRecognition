Now, unto thy bones good night.
Yearly will I do this rite. Good morrow, masters, put your torches out.
The wolves have preyed, and look, the gentle day
Before the wheels of Phoebus round about
Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey.
Thanks to you all, and leave us. Fare you well. Good morrow, masters. Each his several way.
