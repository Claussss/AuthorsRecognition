Shout within Ha, what shout is this?
Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow
In the same time â€™tis made? I will not. Enter Virgilia, Volumnia, Valeria, Young Martius, with attendants My wife comes foremost, then the honoured mould
Wherein this trunk was framed, and in her hand
The grandchild to her blood. But out, affection!
All bond and privilege of nature break;
Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.
