KING EDWARD This counsel, Artois, like to fruitful showers,
Hath added growth unto my dignity,
And by the fiery vigour of thy words
Hot courage is engendered in my breast,
Which heretofore was raked in ignorance
But now doth mount with golden wings of fame
And will approve fair Isabelâ€™s descent,
Able to yoke their stubborn necks with steel
That spurn against my sovereignty in France.
