LEONATO If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn. (To Don John) Let me bid you welcome, my lord. Being reconciled to the Prince your brother, I owe you all duty. DON JOHN I thank you. I am not of many words, but I thank you. LEONATO (to Don Pedro) Please it your grace lead on? DON PEDRO Your hand, Leonato. We will go together. Exeunt all but Benedick and Claudio
