But with a pure appeal seeks to the heart,
Which once corrupted, takes the worser part, And therein heartens up his servile powers
Who, flattered by their leaderâ€™s jocund show,
Stuff up his lust as minutes fill up hours,
And as their captain, so their pride doth grow,
Paying more slavish tribute than they owe.
