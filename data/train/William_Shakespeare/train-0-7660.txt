Report, my lord, hath crossed the narrow seas,
And to the several parts of Christendom
Hath borne the fame of your Lord Chancellor.
I long to see him whom with loving thoughts
I in my study oft have visited.
Is that Sir Thomas More? It is, Erasmus. Now shall you view the honourablest scholar,
The most religious politician,
The worthiest counsellor, that tends our state.
That study is the general watch of England.
In it, the Princeâ€™s safety and the peace
That shines upon our commonwealth are forged
By loyal industry.
