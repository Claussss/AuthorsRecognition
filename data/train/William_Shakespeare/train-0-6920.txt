Enter Olivia, and Viola as Cesario FABIAN Here he comes with your niece. Give them way till he take leave, and presently after him. SIR TOBY I will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a challenge. Exeunt Sir Toby, Fabian, and Maria I have said too much unto a heart of stone,
And laid mine honour too unchary out.
Thereâ€™s something in me that reproves my fault,
But such a headstrong potent fault it is
That it but mocks reproof.
