Call hither Clifford; bid him come amain,
To say if that the bastard boys of York
Shall be the surety for their traitor father. Exit Buckingham O blood-bespotted Neapolitan,
Outcast of Naples, England’s bloody scourge!
The sons of York, thy betters in their birth,
Shall be their father’s bail, and bane to those
That for my surety will refuse the boys.
