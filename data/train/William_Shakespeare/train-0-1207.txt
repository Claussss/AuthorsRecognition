LADY BONA (to the Post) Tell him, in hope he’ll prove a widower shortly,
I’ll wear the willow garland for his sake. QUEEN MARGARET (to the Post) Tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside,
And I am ready to put armour on. WARWICK (to the Post) Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,
And therefore I’ll uncrown him ere’t be long.
(Giving money) There’s thy reward—be gone.
