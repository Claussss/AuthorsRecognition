Now the good gods forbid That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude
Towards her deserved children is enrolled
In Jove’s own book, like an unnatural dam
Should now eat up her own! He’s a disease that must be cut away. O, he’s a limb that has but a disease—
Mortal to cut it off, to cure it easy.
What has he done to Rome that’s worthy death?
Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost—
Which I dare vouch is more than that he hath
By many an ounce—he dropped it for his country;
And what is left, to lose it by his country
Were to us all that do’t and suffer it
A brand to th’ end o’th’ world.
