CLEOPATRA aside Why did he marry Fulvia and not love her?
I’ll seem the fool I am not. (To Antony) Antony
Will be himself. But stirred by Cleopatra. Now, for the love of Love and her soft hours
Let’s not confound the time with conference harsh.
There’s not a minute of our lives should stretch
Without some pleasure now. What sport tonight?
