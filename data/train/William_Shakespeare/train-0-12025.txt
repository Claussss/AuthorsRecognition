That thou durst, Arcite! My coz, my coz, you have been well advertised
How much I dare; you’ve seen me use my sword
Against th’advice of fear. Sure, of another
You would not hear me doubted, but your silence
Should break out, though i’th’ sanctuary. Sir, I have seen you move in such a place which well
Might justify your manhood; you were called
A good knight and a bold. But the whole week’s not
fair
If any day it rain: their valiant temper
Men lose when they incline to treachery,
And then they fight like compelled bears—would fly
Were they not tied.
