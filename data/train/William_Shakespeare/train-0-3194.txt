None are so surely caught when they are catched
As wit turned fool. Folly in wisdom hatched
Hath wisdom’s warrant, and the help of school,
And wit’s own grace, to grace a learned fool. The blood of youth burns not with such excess
As gravity’s revolt to wantonness. Folly in fools bears not so strong a note
As fool’ry in the wise when wit doth dote,
Since all the power thereof it doth apply
To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.
