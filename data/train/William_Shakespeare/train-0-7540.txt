NOTE ON SPECIAL FEATURES OF PRESENTATION 
Complexities in the manuscript have led to the following modifications of standard Oxford Shakespeare presentation.
Rules across the column show where the text switches from the Original Text to a revision and back, or from one revision to another. Notes in the right margin above and below these rules specify the section of the manuscript and the hand.
Annotations in a second hand are preserved and printed in a special typeface. Passages in the manuscript explicitly or implicitly deleted are underlined in this edition, except where the final text as edited duplicates the deleted text (see Appendix B). Identifiable interventions by second hands are as follows:
Tilney: in Sc. 1, Sc. 3, Sc. 10.
