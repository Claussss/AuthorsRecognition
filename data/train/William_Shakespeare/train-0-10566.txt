On your allegiance, Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,
Where were her life? She durst not call me so
If she did know me one. Away with her! I pray you do not push me, I’ll be gone.
Look to your babe, my lord; ‘tis yours. Jove send her
A better guiding spirit. What needs these hands?
You that are thus so tender o’er his follies
Will never do him good, not one of you.
So, so. Farewell, we are gone. Exit
