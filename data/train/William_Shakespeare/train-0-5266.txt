ARCHBISHOP OF YORK Then take, my lord of Westmorland, this schedule;
For this contains our general grievances.
Each several article herein redressed,
All members of our cause, both here and hence,
That are ensinewed to this action
Acquitted by a true substantial form,
And present execution of our wills
To us and to our purposes consigned,
We come within our awe-full banks again,
And knit our powers to the arm of peace.
