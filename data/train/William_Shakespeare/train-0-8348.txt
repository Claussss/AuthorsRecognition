EMILIA Never. To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing? EMILIA Never, my lord. OTHELLO That’s strange. I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,
Lay down my soul at stake. If you think other,
Remove your thought; it doth abuse your bosom.
If any wretch ha’ put this in your head,
Let heaven requite it with the serpent’s curse,
For if she be not honest, chaste, and true,
There’s no man happy; the purest of their wives
Is foul as slander.
