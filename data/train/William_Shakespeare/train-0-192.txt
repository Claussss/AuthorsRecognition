Anonymous (before 1638), in Shakespeare’s
 Poems (1640) 
To Shakespeare Thy muse’s sugared dainties seem to us
Like the famed apples of old Tantalus,
For we, admiring, see and hear thy strains,
But none I see or hear those sweets attains. To the same Thou hast so used thy pen, or shook thy spear,
 That poets startle, nor thy wit come near.
