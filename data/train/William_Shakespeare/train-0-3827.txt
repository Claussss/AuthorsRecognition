O brother Montague, give me thy hand. 295
This is my daughterâ€™s jointure, for no more
Can I demand. MONTAGUE But I can give thee more, For I will raise her statue in pure gold,
That whiles Verona by that name is known
There shall no figure at such rate be set 300
As that of true and faithful Juliet.
