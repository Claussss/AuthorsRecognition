Yes, my lord. CARDINAL WOLSEY (to the King) I fear with dancing is a little heated. KING HENRY I fear too much. CARDINAL WOLSEY There’s fresher air, my lord, In the next chamber. KING HENRY
Lead in your ladies, every one. (To Anne) Sweet partner,
I must not yet forsake you. (To Wolsey) Let’s be merry,
Good my lord Cardinal. I have half a dozen healths
To drink to these fair ladies, and a measure
To lead ’em once again, and then let’s dream
Who’s best in favour. Let the music knock it.
