ISABELLA Please you to do’t, I’ll take it as a peril to my soul
It is no sin at all, but charity. Pleased you to do’t at peril of your soul
Were equal poise of sin and charity. That I do beg his life, if it be sin,
Heaven let me bear it. You granting of my suit,
If that be sin, I’ll make it my morn prayer
To have it added to the faults of mine,
And nothing of your answer.
