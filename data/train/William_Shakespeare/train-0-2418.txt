Where like a virtuous monument she lies
To be admired of lewd unhallowed eyes. Without the bed her other fair hand was,
On the green coverlet, whose perfect white
Showed like an April daisy on the grass,
With pearly sweat resembling dew of night.
Her eyes like marigolds had sheathed their light, And canopied in darkness sweetly lay
Till they might open to adorn the day.
