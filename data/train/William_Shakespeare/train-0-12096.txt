Pray go on, sir. She sung much, but no sense; only I heard her
Repeat this often—‘Palamon is gone,
Is gone to th’ wood to gather mulberries;
I’ll find him out tomorrow.’ FIRST FRIEND Pretty soul! ‘His shackles will betray him—he’ll be taken,
And what shall I do then? I’ll bring a bevy,
A hundred black-eyed maids that love as I do,
With chaplets on their heads of daffodillies,
With cherry lips and cheeks of damask roses,
And all we’ll dance an antic fore the Duke
And beg his pardon.’ Then she talked of you, sir—
That you must lose your head tomorrow morning,
And she must gather flowers to bury you,
And see the house made handsome. Then she sung
Nothing but ‘willow, willow, willow’, and between
Ever was ‘Palamon, fair Palamon’,
And ‘Palamon was a tall young man’. The place
Was knee-deep where she sat; her careless tresses
A wreath of bull-rush rounded; about her stuck
Thousand freshwater flowers of several colours—
That she appeared, methought, like the fair nymph
That feeds the lake with waters, or as Iris
Newly dropped down from heaven. Rings she made
Of rushes that grew by, and to ‘em spoke
The prettiest posies—‘Thus our true love’s tied’,
‘This you may lose, not me’, and many a one.
And then she wept, and sung again, and sighed—
And with the same breath smiled and kissed her
hand.
