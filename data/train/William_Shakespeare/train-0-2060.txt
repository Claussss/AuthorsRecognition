What, think you we are Turks or infidels,
Or that we would against the form of law
Proceed thus rashly in the villain’s death
But that the extreme peril of the case,
The peace of England, and our persons’ safety,
Enforced us to this execution? Now fair befall you, he deserved his death,
And your good graces both have well proceeded,
To warn false traitors from the like attempts.
I never looked for better at his hands
After he once fell in with Mrs Shore.
