O, him she stores to show what wealth she had In days long since, before these last so bad. Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,
When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,
Before these bastard signs of fair were borne
Or durst inhabit on a living brow;
Before the golden tresses of the dead,
The right of sepulchres, were shorn away
To live a second life on second head;
Ere beauty’s dead fleece made another gay.
In him those holy antique hours are seen
Without all ornament, itself and true,
Making no summer of another’s green,
Robbing no old to dress his beauty new;
