The Rape of Lucrece 
From the besieged Ardea all in post,
Borne by the trustless wings of false desire,
Lust-breath
And to Collatium bears the lightless fire
Which, in pale embers hid, lurks to aspire And girdle with embracing flames the waist
Of Collatine’s fair love, Lucrece the chaste. Haply that name of chaste unhapp’ly set
This bateless edge on his keen appetite,
When Collatine unwisely did not let
To praise the clear unmatched red and white
Which triumphed in that sky of his delight,
