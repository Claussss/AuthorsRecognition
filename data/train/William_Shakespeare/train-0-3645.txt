Enter Benvolio and Mercutio 
MERCUTIO Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home tonight? Not to his father’s. I spoke with his man. Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,
Torments him so that he will sure run mad. Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,
Hath sent a letter to his father’s house.
