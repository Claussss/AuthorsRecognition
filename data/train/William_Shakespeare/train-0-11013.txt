Your—wife, so I would say,—affectionate
servant, and for you her own for venture, O indistinguished space of woman’s will—
A plot upon her virtuous husband’s life,
And the exchange my brother!—Here in the sands
Thee I’ll rake up, the post unsanctified
Of murderous lechers, and in the mature time
With this ungracious paper strike the sight
Of the death-practised Duke. For him ’tis well
That of thy death and business I can tell.
