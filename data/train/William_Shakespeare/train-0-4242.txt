Enter a Messenger Where is my prince the Dauphin? LOUIS THE DAUPHIN Here. What news? The Count Melun is slain; the English lords
By his persuasion are again fallâ€™n off;
And your supply which you have wished so long
Are cast away and sunk on Goodwin Sands. LOUIS THE DAUPHIN Ah, foul shrewd news! Beshrew thy very heart
I did not think to be so sad tonight
As this hath made me. Who was he that said
King John did fly an hour or two before
The stumbling night did part our weary powers?
