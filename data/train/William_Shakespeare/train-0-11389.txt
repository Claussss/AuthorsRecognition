INNOGEN (to Belarius) You are my father too, and did relieve me
To see this gracious season. All oâ€™erjoyed, Save these in bonds. Let them be joyful too,
For they shall taste our comfort. INNOGEN (to Lucius) My good master, I will yet do you service. Happy be you! The forlorn soldier that so nobly fought,
He would have well becomed this place, and graced
The thankings of a king.
