Let’s leave this town, for they are hare-brained slaves,
And hunger will enforce them to be more eager.
Of old I know them: rather with their teeth
The walls they’ll tear down, than forsake the siege. I think by some odd gimmers or device
Their arms are set, like clocks, still to strike on,
Else ne’er could they hold out so as they do.
By my consent we’ll even let them alone.
