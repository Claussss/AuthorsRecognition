Be patient, for I will not let him stir
Till I have used the approved means I have,
With wholesome syrups, drugs, and holy prayers
To make of him a formal man again.
It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,
A charitable duty of my order.
Therefore depart, and leave him here with me. I will not hence, and leave my husband here;
And ill it doth beseem your holiness
To separate the husband and the wife.
