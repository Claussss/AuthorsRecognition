QUEEN MARGARET Are you the butcher, Suffolk? Where’s your knife?
Is Beaufort termed a kite? Where are his talons? I wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men.
But here’s a vengeful sword, rusted with ease,
That shall be scoured in his rancorous heart
That slanders me with murder’s crimson badge.
Say, if thou dar’st, proud Lord of Warwickshire,
That I am faulty in Duke Humphrey’s death.
