DESDEMONA Nay, heaven doth know. I will be hanged if some eternal villain,
Some busy and insinuating rogue,
Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,
Have not devised this slander. I will be hanged else. Fie, there is no such man. It is impossible. If any such there be, heaven pardon him. A halter pardon him, and hell gnaw his bones!
Why should he call her whore? Who keeps her
company?
What place, what time, what form, what likelihood?
The Moor’s abused by some most villainous knave,
Some base, notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.
O heaven, that such companions thou’dst unfold,
And put in every honest hand a whip
To lash the rascals naked through the world,
Even from the east to th’ west!
