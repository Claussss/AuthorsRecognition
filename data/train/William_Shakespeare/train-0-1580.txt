I do embrace thee as I would embrace
The Christian prince King Henry, were he here. MARGARET (to Suffolk) Farewell, my lord. Good wishes, praise, and prayers
Shall Suffolk ever have of Margaret. She is going Farewell, sweet madam; but hark you, Margaretâ€”
No princely commendations to my king? Such commendations as becomes a maid,
A virgin, and his servant, say to him.
