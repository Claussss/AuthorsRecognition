PAROLES An idle lord, I swear. BERTRAM I think not so. PAROLES Why, do you not know him? Yes, I do know him well, and common speech
Gives him a worthy pass. Here comes my clog. Enter Helen, attended I have, sir, as I was commanded from you,
Spoke with the King, and have procured his leave
For present parting; only he desires
Some private speech with you.
