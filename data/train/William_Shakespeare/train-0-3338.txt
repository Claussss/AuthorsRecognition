KING RICHARD Thy son is banished upon good advice,
Whereto thy tongue a party verdict gave.
Why at our justice seemâ€™st thou then to lour? JOHN OF GAUNT Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour.
You urged me as a judge, but I had rather
You would have bid me argue like a father.
Alas, I looked when some of you should say
I was too strict to make mine own away,
But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue
Against my will to do myself this wrong.
