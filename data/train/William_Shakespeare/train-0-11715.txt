LORD CHAMBERLAIN Heaven keep me from such counsel! ’Tis most true—
These news are everywhere, every tongue speaks ’em,
And every true heart weeps for’t. All that dare
Look into these affairs see this main end—
The French king’s sister. Heaven will one day open
The King’s eyes, that so long have slept, upon
This bold bad man.
