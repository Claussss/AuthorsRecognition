Good my lord, She came from Libya. Where the warlike Smalus, That noble honoured lord, is feared and loved? Most royal sir, from thence; from him whose daughter
His tears proclaimed his, parting with her. Thence,
A prosperous south wind friendly, we have crossed,
To execute the charge my father gave me
For visiting your highness. My best train
I have from your Sicilian shores dismissed;
Who for Bohemia bend, to signify
Not only my success in Libya, sir,
But my arrival, and my wifeâ€™s, in safety
Here where we are.
