Wishing Adonis had his team to guide
So he were like him, and by Venus’ side. And now Adonis, with a lazy sprite
And with a heavy, dark, disliking eye,
His louring brows o’erwhelming his fair sight,
Like misty vapours when they blot the sky, Souring his cheeks, cries, ‘Fie, no more of love!
The sun doth burn my face; I must remove.’
