SECOND GENTLEMAN How long is this ago? FIRST GENTLEMAN Some twenty years. SECOND GENTLEMAN That a king’s children should be so conveyed,
So slackly guarded, and the search so slow
That could not trace them! FIRST GENTLEMAN Howsoe‘er ’tis strange, Or that the negligence may well be laughed at,
Yet is it true, sir.
