THAISA What isâ€™t to me, my father? KING SIMONIDES O, attend, my daughter. Princes in this
Should live like gods above, who freely give
To everyone that come to honour them.
And princes not so doing are like gnats
Which make a sound but, killed, are wondered at.
Therefore to make his entertain more sweet,
Here bear this standing-bowl of wine to him.
