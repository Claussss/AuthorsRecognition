Why, madam, that is to the Isle of Man,
There to be used according to your state. That’s bad enough, for I am but reproach;
And shall I then be used reproachfully? Like to a duchess and Duke Humphrey’s lady,
According to that state you shall be used. Sheriff, farewell, and better than I fare,
Although thou hast been conduct of my shame.
