A pretty brown wench ’tis. There was a time
When young men went a-hunting, and a wood,
And a broad beech, and thereby hangs a tale—
Heigh-ho! For Emily, upon my life! Fool,
 Away with this strained mirth. I say again,
That sigh was breathed for Emily. Base cousin,
Dar’st thou break first? You are wide.
