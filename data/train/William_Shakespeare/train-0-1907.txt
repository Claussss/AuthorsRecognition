If I should be? I had rather be a pedlar.
Far be it from my heart, the thought thereof. QUEEN ELIZABETH As little joy, my lord, as you suppose
You should enjoy, were you this countryâ€™s king,
As little joy may you suppose in me,
That I enjoy being the queen thereof. QUEEN MARGARET (aside) Ah, little joy enjoys the queen thereof,
For I am she, and altogether joyless.
I can no longer hold me patient.
