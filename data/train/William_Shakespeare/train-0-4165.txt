HUBERT (aside) If I talk to him, with his innocent prate 25
He will awake my mercy, which lies dead;
Therefore I will be sudden, and dispatch. Are you sick, Hubert? You look pale today.
In sooth, I would you were a little sick,
That I might sit all night and watch with you. 30
I warrant I love you more than you do me.
