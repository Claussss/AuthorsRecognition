Yet, good madam, Sometimes her modesty will blow so far
She falls for’t—a maid,
If she have any honour, would be loath
To take example by her. EMILIA Thou art wanton. ARCITE (to Palamon) She is wondrous fair. PALAMON She is all the beauty extant. EMILIA (to her Woman) The sun grows high—let’s walk in. Keep these flowers.
We’ll see how close art can come near their colours.
I am wondrous merry-hearted—I could laugh now.
