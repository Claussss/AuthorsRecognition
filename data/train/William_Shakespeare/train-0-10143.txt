For corn at their own rates, whereof they say
The city is well stored. Hang ’em! They say? They’ll sit by th’ fire and presume to know
What’s done i’th’ Capitol, who’s like to rise,
Who thrives and who declines; side factions and give
out Conjectural marriages, making parties strong
And feebling such as stand not in their liking
Below their cobbled shoes. They say there’s grain
enough!
