FIRST LORD DUMAINE Now God delay our rebellion! As we are ourselves, what things are we. SECOND LORD DUMAINE Merely our own traitors. And as in the common course of all treasons we still see them reveal themselves till they attain to their abhorred ends, so he that in this action contrives against his own nobility, in his proper stream oâ€™erflows himself.
