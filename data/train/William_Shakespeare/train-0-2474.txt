But ill-annexed opportunity
Or kills his life or else his quality. ‘O opportunity, thy guilt is great!
’Tis thou that execut‘st the traitor’s treason;
Thou sets the wolf where he the lamb may get;
Whoever plots the sin, thou points the season.
’Tis thou that spurn’st at right, at law, at reason; And in thy shady cell where none may spy him
Sits sin, to seize the souls that wander by him.
