Who is so faint that dares not be so bold
To touch the fire, the weather being cold? ‘Let me excuse thy courser, gentle boy;
And learn of him, I heartily beseech thee,
To take advantage on presented joy.
Though I were dumb, yet his proceedings teach thee. O, learn to love! The lesson is but plain,
And, once made perfect, never lost again.’
