The Thane of Cawdor lives. Why do you dress me
In borrowed robes? Who was the thane lives yet, But under heavy judgement bears that life
Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined
With those of Norway, or did line the rebel
With hidden help and vantage, or that with both
He laboured in his countryâ€™s wrack, I know not;
But treasons capital, confessed, and proved
Have overthrown him.
