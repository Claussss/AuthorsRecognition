Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit;
For I am sick when I do look on thee. And I am sick when I look not on you. You do impeach your modesty too much,
To leave the city and commit yourself 215
Into the hands of one that loves you not;
To trust the opportunity of night,
And the ill counsel of a desert place,
With the rich worth of your virginity.
