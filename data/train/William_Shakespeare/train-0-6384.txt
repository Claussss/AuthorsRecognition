DUKE SENIOR If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter. If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind. If sight and shape be true,
Why then, my love adieu! ROSALIND (to the Duke) I’ll have no father if you be not he.
(To Orlando) I’ll have no husband if you be not he,
(To Phoebe) Nor ne’er wed woman if you be not she.
