Plainly spoken, Yet—pardon me—hard language: when I spur
Wind horns within
My horse I chide him not. Content and anger
In me have but one face. Hark, sir, they call
The scattered to the banquet. You must guess
I have an office there. Sir, your attendance Cannot please heaven, and I know your office
Unjustly is achieved.
