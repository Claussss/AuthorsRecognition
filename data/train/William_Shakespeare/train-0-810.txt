FIRST PRENTICE (offering drink to Peter) Here, Peter, I drink to thee, and be not afeard. SECOND PRENTICE (offering drink to Peter) Here, Peter, here’s a pint of claret wine for thee. THIRD PRENTICE (offering drink to Peter) And here’s a quart for me, and be merry, Peter, and fear not thy master. Fight for credit of the prentices!
