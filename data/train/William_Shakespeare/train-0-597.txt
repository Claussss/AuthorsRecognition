LUCENTIO And what of him, Tranio? If he be credulous and trust my tale,
Iâ€™ll make him glad to seem Vincentio
And give assurance to Baptista Minola
As if he were the right Vincentio.
Take in your love, and then let me alone. Exeunt Lucentio and Bianca Enter a Pedant God save you, sir. And you, sir. You are welcome.
