PRINCE OF WALES Ah, good old man! A thousand thousand armours
These words of thine have buckled on my back.
Ah, what an idiot hast thou made of life
To seek the thing it fears, and how disgraced
Th‘imperial victory of murd’ring death,
Since all the lives his conquering arrows strike
Seek him, and he not them, to shame his glory.
I will not give a penny for a life,
Nor half a halfpenny to shun grim death,
Since for to live is but to seek to die,
And dying but beginning of new life.
Let come the hour when he that rules it will.
To live or die I hold indifferent still.
