I have heard it, Pompey, And am well studied for a liberal thanks
Which I do owe you. Let me have your hand. Pompey and Antony shake hands I did not think, sir, to have met you here. The beds i’th’ East are soft; and thanks to you,
That called me timelier than my purpose hither;
For I have gained by’t.
