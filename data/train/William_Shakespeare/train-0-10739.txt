Enter the Old Shepherd and the Clown, dressed as gentlemen Here come those I have done good to against my will, and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune. OLD SHEPHERD Come, boy; I am past more children, but thy sons and daughters will be all gentlemen born. CLOWN (to Autolycus) You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me this other day because I was no gentleman born. See you these clothes? Say you see them not, and think me still no gentleman born. You were best say these robes are not gentlemen born. Give me the lie, do, and try whether I am not now a gentleman born.
