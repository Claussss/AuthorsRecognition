Enter Mardian O thy vile lady, She has robbed me of my sword! No, Antony, My mistress loved thee, and her fortunes mingled
With thine entirely. Hence, saucy eunuch, peace! She hath betrayed me, and shall die the death. Death of one person can be paid but once,
And that she has discharged. What thou wouldst do
Is done unto thy hand. The last she spake
Was ‘Antony, most noble Antony!’
Then in the midst a tearing groan did break
The name of Antony. It was divided
Between her heart and lips. She rendered life,
Thy name so buried in her.
