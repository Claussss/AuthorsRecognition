Sc. 2
Enter the Countess of Salisbury, above 
COUNTESS OF SALISBURY Alas, how much in vain my poor eyes gaze
For succour that my sovereign should send.
Ah, cousin Montague, I fear thou wants
The lively spirit sharply to solicit
With vehement suit the King in my behalf.
Thou dost not tell him what a grief it is
To be the scornful captive to a Scot,
Either to be wooed with broad untuned oaths,
Or forced by rough insulting barbarism.
Thou dost not tell him, if he here prevail,
How much they will deride us in the North,
And in their vile, uncivil, skipping jigs
Bray forth their conquest and our overthrow
Even in the barren, bleak and fruitless airâ€”
