Next her hair, forehead fair,
Smooth and high; neat doth lie,
without wrinkle,
Her fair brows; under those,
Star-like eyes win love’s prize
when they twinkle.
In her cheeks who seeks
Shall find there displayed beauty’s banner;
O admiring desiring
Breeds, as I look still upon her.
7 Thin lips red, fancy’s fed
With all sweets when he meets,
and is granted
There to trade, and is made
Happy, sure, to endure
still undaunted.
Pretty chin doth win
Of all their culled commendations;
Fairest neck, no speck;
All her parts merit high admirations.
