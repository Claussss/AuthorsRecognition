‘Tis fit thou shouldst wax proud, or else thou’lt ne‘er
Be near allied to greatness. Observe me, sirrah.
The learned clerk Erasmus is arrived
Within our English court. Last night, I hear,
He feasted with our English honoured poet
The Earl of Surrey, and I learned today
The famous clerk of Rotterdam will visit
Sir Thomas More. Therefore, sir, take my seat.
You are Lord Chancellor. Dress your behaviour
According to my carriage. But beware
You talk not overmuch, for ’twill betray thee.
Who prates not much seems wise, his wit few scan,
While the tongue blabs tales of the imperfect man.
I’ll see if great Erasmus can distinguish
Merit and outward ceremony.
