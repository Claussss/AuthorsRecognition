Isabella How now, fair maid? ISABELLA I am come to know your pleasure. ANGELO (aside) That you might know it would much better please me
Than to demand what â€™tis. (To Isabella) Your brother
cannot live. ISABELLA Even so. Heaven keep your honour. Yet may he live a while, and it may be
As long as you or I. Yet he must die.
