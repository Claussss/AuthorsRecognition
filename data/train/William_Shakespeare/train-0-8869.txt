SERVILIUS Yes, sir, I shall. I’ll look you out a good turn, Servilius. Exit Servilius
True as you said: Timon is shrunk indeed;
And he that’s once denied will hardly speed. Exit FIRST STRANGER Do you observe this, Hostilius? SECOND STRANGER Ay, too well. FIRST STRANGER Why, this is the world’s soul, and just of the same piece
Is every flatterer’s spirit. Who can call him his friend
That dips in the same dish? For, in my knowing,
Timon has been this lord’s father
And kept his credit with his purse,
Supported his estate; nay, Timon’s money
Has paid his men their wages. He ne’er drinks,
But Timon’s silver treads upon his lip;
And yet—O see the monstrousness of man
When he looks out in an ungrateful shape!—
He does deny him, in respect of his,
What charitable men afford to beggars.
