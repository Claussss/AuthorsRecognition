RICHARD GLOUCESTER (aside) So wise so young, they say, do never live long. PRINCE EDWARD What say you, uncle? RICHARD GLOUCESTER I say, ‘Without characters fame lives long’.
(Aside) Thus like the formal Vice, Iniquity,
I moralize two meanings in one word. PRINCE EDWARD That Julius Caesar was a famous man:
With what his valour did t’enrich his wit,
His wit set down to make his valour live.
Death made no conquest of this conqueror,
For yet he lives in fame though not in life.
I’ll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham.
