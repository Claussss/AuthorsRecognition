SIR ANDREW An’t be any way, it must be with valour, for policy I hate. I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician. SIR TOBY Why then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valour. Challenge me the Count’s youth to fight with him, hurt him in eleven places. My niece shall take note of it; and assure thyself, there is no love-broker in the world can more prevail in man’s commendation with woman than report of valour.
