Pure Diana, I bless thee for thy vision, and will offer
Nightly oblations to thee.—Beloved Thaisa,
This prince, the fair betrothed of your daughter,
At Pentapolis shall marry her.
(To Marina) And now this ornament
Makes me look dismal will I clip to form,
And what this fourteen years no razor touched,
To grace thy marriage day I’ll beautify.
