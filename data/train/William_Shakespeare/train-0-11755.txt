CARDINAL CAMPEIUS So please your highness, The Queen being absent, â€™tis a needful fitness
That we adjourn this court till further day.
Meanwhile must be an earnest motion
Made to the Queen to call back her appeal
She intends unto his holiness. KING HENRY (aside) I may perceive These cardinals trifle with me. I abhor
This dilatory sloth and tricks of Rome.
My learned and well-belov
Prithee return. With thy approach I know
My comfort comes along. (Aloud) Break up the court.
I say, set on.
