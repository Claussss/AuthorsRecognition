KING OF SCOTLAND She mocks us, Douglas. I cannot endure it. COUNTESS OF SALISBURY Say, good my lord, which is he must have the lady,
And which her jewels? I am sure, my lords,
Ye will not hence till you have shared the spoils. KING OF SCOTLAND She heard the messenger and heard our talk,
And now that comfort makes her scorn at us.
