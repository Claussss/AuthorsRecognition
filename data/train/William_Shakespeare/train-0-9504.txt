Farewell, great chief. Shall I strike now? Eros stabs himself Why, there then, thus I do escape the sorrow Of Antony’s death. Thrice nobler than myself, Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what
I should and thou couldst not. My queen and Eros
Have by their brave instruction got upon me
A nobleness in record. But I will be
A bridegroom in my death, and run into’t
As to a lover’s bed. Come then, and, Eros,
Thy master dies thy scholar. To do thus
I learned of thee.
