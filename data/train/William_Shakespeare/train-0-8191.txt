DESDEMONA Well praised! How if she be black and witty? If she be black and thereto have a wit,
She’ll find a white that shall her blackness fit. Worse and worse. How if fair and foolish? She never yet was foolish that was fair,
For even her folly helped her to an heir. DESDEMONA These are old fond paradoxes, to make fools laugh i’th’ alehouse.
