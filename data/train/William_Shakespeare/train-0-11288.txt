Look, here he comes, And brings the dire occasion in his arms
Of what we blame him for. The bird is dead That we have made so much on. I had rather
Have skipped from sixteen years of age to sixty,
To have turned my leaping time into a crutch,
Than have seen this. GUIDERIUS (to Innogen) O sweetest, fairest lily!
