One score ’twixt sun and sun, Madam, ’s enough for you, and too much too. Why, one that rode to ’s execution, man,
Could never go so slow. I have heard of riding wagers
Where horses have been nimbler than the sands
That run i‘th’ clock’s behalf. But this is fool’ry.
Go bid my woman feign a sickness, say
She’ll home to her father; and provide me presently
A riding-suit no costlier than would fit
A franklin’s housewife.
