KING EDWARD See how occasion laughs me in the face!
No sooner minded to prepare for France
But straight I am invited—nay, with threats,
Upon a penalty, enjoined to come!
‘Twere but a childish part to say him nay.
Lorraine, return this answer to thy lord:
I mean to visit him as he requests.
But how? Not servilely disposed to bend,
But like a conqueror to make him bow.
His lame unpolished shifts are come to light,
And truth hath pulled the vizard from his face
That set a gloss upon his arrogance.
Dare he command a fealty in me?
Tell him the crown that he usurps is mine,
And where he sets his foot he ought to kneel.
’Tis not a petty dukedom that I claim
But all the whole dominions of the realm
Which if, with grudging, he refuse to yield
I’ll take away those borrowed plumes of his,
And send him naked to the wilderness.
