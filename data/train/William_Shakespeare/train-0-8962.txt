Then I know thee not. I never had
Honest man about me; ay, all I kept were knaves,
To serve in meat to villains. FLAVIUS The gods are witness, Ne’er did poor steward wear a truer grief
For his undone lord than mine eyes for you. What, dost thou weep? Come. nearer then; I love thee
Because thou art a woman, and disclaim’st
Flinty mankind whose eyes do never give
But thorough lust and laughter. Pity’s sleeping.
Strange times, that weep with laughing, not with
weeping!
