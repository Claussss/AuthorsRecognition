Why then would you deal so cunningly, So strangely, so unlike a noble kinsman,
To love alone? Speak truly. Do you think me
Unworthy of her sight? No, but unjust If thou pursue that sight. Because another First sees the enemy, shall I stand still,
And let mine honour down, and never charge? Yes, if he be but one.
