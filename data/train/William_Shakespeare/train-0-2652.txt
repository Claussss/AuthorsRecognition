KING EDWARD Didst thou not swear to give me what I would? COUNTESS OF SALISBURY I did, my liege, so what you would I could. KING EDWARD I wish no more of thee than thou mayst give,
Nor beg I do not, but I rather buyâ€”
That is, thy love; and for that love of thine
In rich exchange I tender to thee mine.
