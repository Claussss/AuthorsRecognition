Shall all thy mother’s hopes lie in one tomb? Ay, rather than I’ll shame my mother’s womb. Upon my blessing I command thee go. To fight I will, but not to fly the foe. Part of thy father may be saved in thee. No part of him but will be shamed in me. Thou never hadst renown, nor canst not lose it. Yes, your renowned name—shall flight abuse it?
