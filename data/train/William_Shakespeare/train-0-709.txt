Cousin of Buckingham, though Humphrey’s pride
And greatness of his place be grief to us,
Yet let us watch the haughty Cardinal;
His insolence is more intolerable
Than all the princes in the land beside.
If Gloucester be displaced, he’ll be Protector. Or thou or I, Somerset, will be Protector,
Despite Duke Humphrey or the Cardinal.
