That kings might be espoused to more fame,
But king nor peer to such a peerless dame. O happiness enjoyed but of a few,
And, if possessed, as soon decayed and done
As is the morning’s silver melting dew
Against the golden splendour of the sun,
An expired date cancelled ere well begun! Honour and beauty in the owner’s arms
Are weakly fortressed from a world of harms.
