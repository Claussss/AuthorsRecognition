JAQUES Thus it goes: If it do come to pass
That any man turn ass,
Leaving his wealth and ease
A stubborn will to please, Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame.
Here shall he see
Gross fools as he,
An if he will come to me. AMIENS What’s that ‘ducdame’? JAQUES ’Tis a Greek invocation to call fools into a circle. I’ll go sleep if I can. If I cannot, I’ll rail against all the firstborn of Egypt.
