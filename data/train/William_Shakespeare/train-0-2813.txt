KING EDWARD What moved thee, then, to be so obstinate
To contradict our royal Queen’s desire? No wilful disobedience, mighty lord,
But my desert, and public law at arms.
I took the King, myself, in single fight,
And, like a soldier, would be loath to lose
The least pre-eminence that I had won.
And Copland, straight upon your highness’ charge,
Is come to France, and with a lowly mind
Doth vail the bonnet of his victory.
Receive, dread lord, the custom of my freight,
The wealthy tribute of my labouring hands,
Which should long since have been surrendered up,
Had but your gracious self been there in place.
