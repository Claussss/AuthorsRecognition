More welcome is the stroke of death to me
Than Bolingbroke to England. My comfort is that heaven will take our souls,
And plague injustice with the pains of hell. BOLINGBROKE My lord Northumberland, see them dispatched. Exit Northumberland, with Bushy and Green, guarded Uncle, you say the Queen is at your house.
For Godâ€™s sake, fairly let her be intreated.
Tell her I send to her my kind commends.
Take special care my greetings be delivered.
