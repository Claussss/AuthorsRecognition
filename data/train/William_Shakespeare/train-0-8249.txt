CASSIO Ay, but, lady, That policy may either last so long,
Or feed upon such nice and wat’rish diet,
Or breed itself so out of circumstance,
That, I being absent and my place supplied,
My general will forget my love and service. Do not doubt that. Before Emilia here
I give thee warrant of thy place. Assure thee,
If I do vow a friendship I’ll perform it
To the last article. My lord shall never rest.
I’ll watch him tame, and talk him out of patience.
His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift.
I’ll intermingle everything he does
With Cassio’s suit. Therefore be merry, Cassio,
For thy solicitor shall rather die
Than give thy cause away.
