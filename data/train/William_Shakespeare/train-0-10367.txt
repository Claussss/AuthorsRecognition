ADRIAN You take my part from me, sir. I have the most cause to be glad of yours. NICANOR Well, let us go together. Exeunt 4.4
Enter Coriolanus in mean apparel, disguised and muffled 
CORIOLANUS A goodly city is this Antium. City,
â€™Tis I that made thy widows. Many an heir
Of these fair edifices fore my wars
Have I heard groan and drop. Then know me not,
Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones
In puny battle slay me.
