Then with the losers let it sympathize,
For nothing can seem foul to those that win. The trumpet sounds
a parley within. Enter the Earl of Worcester
and Sir Richard Vernon How now, my lord of Worcester? â€™Tis not well
That you and I should meet upon such terms 10
As now we meet. You have deceived our trust,
And made us doff our easy robes of peace
To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel.
This is not well, my lord, this is not well.
What say you to it? Will you again unknit 15
This churlish knot of all-abhorred war,
And move in that obedient orb again
Where you did give a fair and natural light,
And be no more an exhaled meteor,
A prodigy of fear, and a portent
Of broached mischief to the unborn times?
