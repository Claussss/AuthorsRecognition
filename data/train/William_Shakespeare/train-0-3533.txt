Thy pains, Fitzwalter, shall not be forgot.
Right noble is thy merit, well I wot. Enter Harry Percy, with the Bishop of Carlisle, guarded HARRY PERCY The grand conspirator Abbot of Westminster,
With clog of conscience and sour melancholy,
Hath yielded up his body to the grave.
But here is Carlisle living, to abide
Thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride.
