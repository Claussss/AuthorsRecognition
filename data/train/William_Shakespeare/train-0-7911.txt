ANGELO He’s sentenced; ’tis too late. LUCIO (aside to Isabella) You are too cold. Too late? Why, no; I that do speak a word
May call it again. Well, believe this,
No ceremony that to great ones ’longs,
Not the king’s crown, nor the deputed sword,
The marshal’s truncheon, nor the judge’s robe,
Become them with one half so good a grace
As mercy does.
If he had been as you and you as he,
You would have slipped like him, but he, like you,
Would not have been so stern.
