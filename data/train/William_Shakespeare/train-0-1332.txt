A. Our edition adopts the 1595 version of 1.1.120-5 in the belief that it reflects an authorial revision; an edited text of the Folio alternative follows. Peace, thou—and give King Henry leave to speak. Plantagenet shall speak first—hear him, lords,
And be you silent and attentive too,
For he that interrupts him shall not live.
