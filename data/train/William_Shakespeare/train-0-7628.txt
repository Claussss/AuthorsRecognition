Enter Croft Enter Crofts How now, Crofts? What news? My lord, his highness sends express command
That a record be entered of this riot,
And that the chief and capital offenders
Be thereon straight arraigned; for himself intends
To sit in person on the rest tomorrow
At Westminster. Lord Mayor, you hear your charge.
