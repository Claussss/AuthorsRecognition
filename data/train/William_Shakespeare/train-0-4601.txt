SIR JOHN Are not you a coward? Answer me to that. And Poins there? POINS Zounds, ye fat paunch, an ye call me coward, by the Lord I’ll stab thee. SIR JOHN I call thee coward? I’ll see thee damned ere I call thee coward, but I would give a thousand pound I could run as fast as thou canst. You are straight enough in the shoulders; you care not who sees your back. Call you that backing of your friends ? A plague upon such backing! Give me them that will face me. Give me a cup of sack. I am a rogue if I drunk today.
