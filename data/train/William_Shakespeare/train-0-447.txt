From all such devils, good Lord deliver us. GREMIO And me too, good Lord. TRANIO (aside to Lucentio) Husht, master, here’s some good pastime toward.
That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward. LUCENTIO (aside to Tranio) But in the other’s silence do I see
Maid’s mild behaviour and sobriety.
Peace, Tranio.
