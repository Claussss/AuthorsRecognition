EDGAR Give me your arm. Up. So, how now? Feel you your legs? You stand. Too well, too well. EDGAR This is above all strangeness. Upon the crown of the cliff what thing was that
Which parted from you? GLOUCESTER A poor unfortunate beggar. As I stood here below, methoughts his eyes
Were two full moons. A had a thousand noses,
Horns whelked and waved like the enridged sea.
It was some fiend. Therefore, thou happy father,
Think that the clearest gods, who made their honours
Of menâ€™s impossibilities, have preserved thee.
