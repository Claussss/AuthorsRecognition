No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,
No woman had it, but a civil doctor
Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me,
And begged the ring, the which I did deny him,
And suffered him to go displeased away,
Even he that had held up the very life
Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?
I was enforced to send it after him.
I was beset with shame and courtesy.
My honour would not let ingratitude
So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady,
For by these bless
Had you been there I think you would have begged
The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.
