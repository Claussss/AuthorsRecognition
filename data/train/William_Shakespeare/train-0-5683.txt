BARDOLPH Good lieutenant, good corporal, offer nothing here. Pish for thee, Iceland dog. Thou prick-eared cur of
Iceland. HOSTESS Good Corporal Nim, show thy valour, and put
up your sword.
They sheathe their swords NIM Will you shog off? I would have you solus. ‘Solus’, egregious dog? O viper vile!
The solus in thy most marvellous face,
The solus in thy teeth, and in thy throat,
And in thy hateful lungs, yea in thy maw pardie—
And which is worse, within thy nasty mouth.
I do retort the solus in thy bowels,
For I can take, and Pistol’s cock is up,
And flashing fire will follow.
