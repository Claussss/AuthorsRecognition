B. For 1.4.39 The Spirit sinks down again BOLINGBROKE Then down, I say, unto the damned pool
Where Pluto in his fiery wagon sits

Rise, Jordan, rise, and stay thy charming spells—
Zounds, we are betrayed!

particular interest because they supply Buckingham with
speeches for this latter part of the scene.
