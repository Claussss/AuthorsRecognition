So, they are well dispatched. Now to my daughter’s
letter.
She tells me here she’ll wed the stranger knight,
Or never more to view nor day nor light.
I like that well. Nay, how absolute she’s in‘t,
Not minding whether I dislike or no!
Mistress, ’tis well, I do commend your choice,
And will no longer have it be delayed.
