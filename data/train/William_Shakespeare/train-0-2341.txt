To wash the foul face of the sluttish ground,
Who is but drunken when she seemeth drowned. O hard-believing loveâ€”how strange it seems
Not to believe, and yet too credulous!
Thy weal and woe are both of them extremes.
Despair, and hope, makes thee ridiculous. The one doth flatter thee in thoughts unlikely;
In likely thoughts the other kills thee quickly.
