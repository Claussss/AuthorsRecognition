Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace
As ‘longeth to a lover’s blessed case.
Nay, I have ta’en you napping, gentle love,
And have forsworn you with Hortensio. Tranio, you jest. But have you both forsworn me? Mistress, we have. LUCENTIO Then we are rid of Licio. I’faith, he’ll have a lusty widow now,
That shall be wooed and wedded in a day.
