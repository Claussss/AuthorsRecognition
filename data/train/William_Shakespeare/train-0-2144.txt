KING RICHARD You mock me, madam. This is not the way
To win your daughter. QUEEN ELIZABETH There is no other way, Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,
And not be Richard, that hath done all this. KING RICHARD Infer fair Englandâ€™s peace by this alliance. QUEEN ELIZABETH Which she shall purchase with still-lasting war.
