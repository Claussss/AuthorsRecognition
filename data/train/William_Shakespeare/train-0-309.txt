When would you use it? Pray sir, tell me that. This very night; for love is like a child
That longs for everything that he can come by. By seven o’clock I’ll get you such a ladder. But hark thee: I will go to her alone.
How shall I best convey the ladder thither? It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it
Under a cloak that is of any length.
