Proud of employment, willingly I go. All pride is willing pride, and yours is so. Exit Boyet
Who are the votaries, my loving lords,
That are vow-fellows with this virtuous duke? Lord Longueville is one. PRINCESS Know you the man? I know him, madam. At a marriage feast
Between Lord Perigord and the beauteous heir
Of Jaques Fauconbridge solemnized
In Normandy saw I this Longueville.
A man of sovereign parts he is esteemed,
Well fitted in arts, glorious in arms.
Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.
The only soil of his fair virtue’s gloss-
If virtue’s gloss will stain with any soil-
Is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will,
Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills
It should none spare that come within his power.
