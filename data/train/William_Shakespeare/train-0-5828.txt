Enter Montjoy Here comes the herald of the French, my liege. His eyes are humbler than they used to be. How now, what means this, herald? Know‘st thou
not
That I have fined these bones of mine for ransom?
Com’st thou again for ransom? MONTJOY No, great King. I come to thee for charitable licence,
That we may wander o’er this bloody field
To book our dead and then to bury them,
To sort our nobles from our common men—
For many of our princes, woe the while,
Lie drowned and soaked in mercenary blood.
So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs
In blood of princes, and our wounded steeds
Fret fetlock-deep in gore, and with wild rage
Jerk out their armed heels at their dead masters,
Killing them twice. O give us leave, great King,
To view the field in safety, and dispose
Of their dead bodies.
