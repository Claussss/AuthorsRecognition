O, well did he become that lion’s robe
That did disrobe the lion of that robe! It lies as sightly on the back of him
As great Alcides’ shows upon an ass.
But, ass, I’ll take that burden from your back, 145
Or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack. What cracker is this same that deafs our ears
With this abundance of superfluous breath ?—
King Philip, determine what we shall do straight.
