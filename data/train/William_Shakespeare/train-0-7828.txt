PLAYER of WIT That’s more than we heard before, my lord. MORE Am I a man of equity Equally to divide true right his own,
And shall I have deceivers in my house?
Go pull the coat over the varlet’s ears.
There are too many such.
Give them their due. Lead on away.
B2. First Version of 17.106-127 (Stay... states) in the Original Text.
