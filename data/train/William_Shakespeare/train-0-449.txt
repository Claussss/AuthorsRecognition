Sister, content you in my discontent.
(To Baptista) Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe.
My books and instruments shall be my company,
On them to look and practise by myself. LUCENTIO (aside to Tranio) Hark, Tranio, thou mayst hear Minerva speak. Signor Baptista, will you be so strange?
Sorry am I that our good will effects
Biancaâ€™s grief.
