Erasmus preacheth gospel against physic.—
My noble poet— SURREY O my lord, you tax me In that word ‘poet’ of much idleness.
It is a study that makes poor our fate.

To such contempt. That I may speak my heart,
It is the sweetest heraldry of art
That sets a difference ’tween the tough, sharp holly
And tender bay tree.
