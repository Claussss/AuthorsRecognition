Vengeance, plague, death, confusion! ‘Fiery’? What ‘quality’? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester, I’d speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife. Well, my good lord, I have informed them so. ‘Informed them’? Dost thou understand me, man? GLOUCESTER Ay, my good lord. The King would speak with Cornwall; the dear father
Would with his daughter speak, commands, tends
service.
Are they ‘informed’ of this? My breath and blood—
‘Fiery’? The ‘fiery’ Duke—tell the hot Duke that—
No, but not yet. Maybe he is not well.
Infirmity doth still neglect all office
Whereto our health is bound. We are not ourselves
When nature, being oppressed, commands the mind
To suffer with the body. I’ll forbear,
And am fallen out with my more headier will,
To take the indisposed and sickly fit
For the sound man.—Death on my state, wherefore
Should he sit here? This act persuades me
That this remotion of the Duke and her
Is practice only. Give me my servant forth.
Go tell the Duke and’s wife I’d speak with them,
Now, presently. Bid them come forth and hear me,
Or at their chamber door I’ll beat the drum
Till it cry sleep to death.
