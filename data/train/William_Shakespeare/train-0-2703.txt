FRENCHMAN WITHOUT BAGGAGE Well met, my masters. How now? Whatâ€™s the news,
And wherefore are ye laden thus with stuff?
What, is it quarter-day, that you remove,
And carry bag and baggage too? FIRST FRENCHMAN WITH BAGGAGE Quarter-day, ay, and quartering day I fear.
Have ye not heard the news that flies abroad?
