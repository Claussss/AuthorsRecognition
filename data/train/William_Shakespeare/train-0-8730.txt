Sc. 24
Enter Edmund with King Lear and Queen Cordelia prisoners, a Captain, and soldiers Some officers take them away. Good guard
Until their greater pleasures best be known
That are to censure them. CORDELIA (to Lear) We are not the first Who with best meaning have incurred the worst.
For thee, oppressed King, am I cast down,
Myself could else outfrown false fortuneâ€™s frown.
Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?
