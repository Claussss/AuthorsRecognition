POSTHUMUS Over-roasted rather; ready long ago. JAILER Hanging is the word, sir. If you be ready for that, you are well cooked. POSTHUMUS So, if I prove a good repast to the spectators, the dish pays the shot. JAILER A heavy reckoning for you, sir. But the comfort is, you shall be called to no more payments, fear no more tavern bills, which are as often the sadness of parting as the procuring of mirth. You come in faint for want of meat, depart reeling with too much drink, sorry that you have paid too much and sorry that you are paid too much; purse and brain both empty: the brain the heavier for being too light, the purse too light, being drawn of heaviness. Of this contradiction you shall now be quit. O, the charity of a penny cord! It sums up thousands in a trice. You have no true debitor and creditor but it: of whatâ€™s past, is, and to come the discharge. Your neck, sir, is pen, book, and counters; so the acquittance follows.
