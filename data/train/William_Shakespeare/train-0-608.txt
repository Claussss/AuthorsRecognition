Enter Tailor with a gown Come, tailor, let us see these ornaments.
Lay forth the gown. Enter Haberdasher with a cap What news with you, sir? HABERDASHER Here is the cap your worship did bespeak. Why, this was moulded on a porringer—
A velvet dish. Fie, fie, ‘tis lewd and filthy.
Why, ’tis a cockle or a walnut-shell,
A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby’s cap.
Away with it! Come, let me have a bigger.
