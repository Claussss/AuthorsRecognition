PROTEUS My shame and guilt confounds me. Forgive me, Valentine. If hearty sorrow
Be a sufficient ransom for offence,
I tender’t here. I do as truly suffer
As e’er I did commit. VALENTINE Then I am paid, And once again I do receive thee honest.
Who by repentance is not satisfied
Is nor of heaven nor earth. For these are pleased;
By penitence th’ Eternal’s wrath’s appeased.
And that my love may appear plain and free,
All that was mine in Silvia I give thee.
