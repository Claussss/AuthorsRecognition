Now by the death of Him that died for all,
These counties were the keys of Normandy—
But wherefore weeps Warwick, my valiant son? For grief that they are past recovery.
For were there hope to conquer them again
My sword should shed hot blood, mine eyes no tears.
Anjou and Maine? Myself did win them both!
Those provinces these arms of mine did conquer—
And are the cities that I got with wounds
Delivered up again with peaceful words?
Mort Dieu!
