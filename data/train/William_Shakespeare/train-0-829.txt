CARDINAL BEAUFORT (to King Henry) Did he not, contrary to form of law,
Devise strange deaths for small offences done? YORK (to King Henry) And did he not, in his Protectorship,
Levy great sums of money through the realm
For soldiersâ€™ pay in France, and never sent it,
By means whereof the towns each day revolted?
