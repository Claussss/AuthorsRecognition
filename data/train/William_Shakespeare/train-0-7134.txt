SERVANT I hope I shall know your honour better. PANDARUS I do desire it. SERVANT You are in the state of grace? PANDARUS Grace? Not so, friend. ‘Honour’ and ‘lordship’ are my titles. What music is this? SERVANT I do but partly know, sir. It is music in parts. PANDARUS Know you the musicians? SERVANT Wholly, sir.
