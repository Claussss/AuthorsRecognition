By heaven, thy love is black as ebony. Is ebony like her? O word divine!
A wife of such wood were felicity.
O, who can give an oath? Where is a book,
That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack
If that she learn not of her eye to look?
No face is fair that is not full so black. O paradox ! Black is the badge of hell,
The hue of dungeons and the style of night,
And beautyâ€™s crest becomes the heavens well.
