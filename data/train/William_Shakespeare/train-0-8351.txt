OTHELLO Why, what art thou? Your wife, my lord, your true and loyal wife. OTHELLO Come, swear it, damn thyself, Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves
Should fear to seize thee. Therefore be double-damned:
Swear thou art honest. DESDEMONA Heaven doth truly know it. 40 Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.
