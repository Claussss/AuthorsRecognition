DUCHESS OF YORK Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold
In him that did object the same to thee.
He was the wretchedâ€™st thing when he was young,
So long a-growing, and so leisurely,
That if his rule were true he should be gracious. Why, so no doubt he is, my gracious madam. DUCHESS OF YORK I hope he is, but yet let mothers doubt.
