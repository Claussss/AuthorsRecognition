Please your highness, I will from hence today. You know the peril. I’ll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying
The pangs of barred affections, though the King
Hath charged you should not speak together. Exit O dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant
Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,
I something fear my father’s wrath, but nothing—
Always reserved my holy duty—what
His rage can do on me. You must be gone,
And I shall here abide the hourly shot
Of angry eyes, not comforted to live
But that there is this jewel in the world
That I may see again.
