And so do I, victorious prince of York.
Before I see thee seated in that throne
Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,
I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.
This is the palace of the fearful King,
And this (pointing to the chair of state), the regal
seat—possess it, York,
For this is thine, and not King Henry’s heirs’.
