JOHN OF GAUNT God’s is the quarrel; for God’s substitute,
His deputy anointed in his sight,
Hath caused his death; the which if wrongfully,
Let heaven revenge, for I may never lift
An angry arm against his minister. DUCHESS OF GLOUCESTER Where then, alas, may I complain myself? JOHN OF GAUNT To God, the widow’s champion and defence.
