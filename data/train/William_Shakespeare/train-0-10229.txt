What is it?—’Coriolanus’ must I call thee? But O, thy wife! CORIOLANUS (to Virgilia) My gracious silence, hail. Wouldst thou have laughed had I come coffined
home,
That weep’st to see me triumph? Ah, my dear,
Such eyes the widows in Corioles wear,
And mothers that lack sons. Now the gods crown thee!
