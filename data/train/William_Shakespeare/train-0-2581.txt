If children predecease progenitors,
We are their offspring, and they none of ours. â€˜Poor broken glass, I often did behold
In thy sweet semblance my old age new born;
But now that fair fresh mirror, dim and old,
Shows me a bare-boned death by time outworn.
O, from thy cheeks my image thou hast torn, And shivered all the beauty of my glass,
That I no more can see what once I was.
