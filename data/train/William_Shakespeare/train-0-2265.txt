Sometime he scuds far off, and there he stares;
Anon he starts at stirring of a feather.
To bid the wind a base he now prepares,
And wheâ€™er he run or fly they know not whether; For through his mane and tail the high wind sings,
Fanning the hairs, who wave like feathered wings. He looks upon his love, and neighs unto her;
She answers him as if she knew his mind.
Being proud, as females are, to see him woo her,
She puts on outward strangeness, seems unkind,
