LORENZO (to Jessica) Sweet soul, letâ€™s in, and there expect their coming.
And yet no matter. Why should we go in?
My friend Stefano, signify, I pray you,
Within the house your mistress is at hand,
And bring your music forth into the air. Exit Stefano
How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!
Here will we sit, and let the sounds of music
Creep in our ears. Soft stillness and the night
Become the touches of sweet harmony.
Sit, Jessica.
