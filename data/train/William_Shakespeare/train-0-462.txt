TRANIO So had you need. [They
exchange
clothes] In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,
And I am tied to be obedient—
For so your father charged me at our parting,
‘Be serviceable to my son,’ quoth he,
Although I think ’twas in another sense—
I am content to be Lucentio
Because so well I love Lucentio.
