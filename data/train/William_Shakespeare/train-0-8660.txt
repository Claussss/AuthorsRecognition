ALBANY See thyself, devil. Proper deformity shows not in the fiend
So horrid as in woman. GONORIL O vain fool! 60 Thou changed and self-covered thing, for shame
Bemonster not thy feature. Were’t my fitness
To let these hands obey my blood,
They are apt enough to dislocate and tear
Thy flesh and bones. Howe’er thou art a fiend,
A woman’s shape doth shield thee.
