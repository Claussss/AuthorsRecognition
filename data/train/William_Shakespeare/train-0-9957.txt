KING SIMONIDES Come, gentlemen, we sit too long on trifles,
And waste the time which looks for other revels.
Ev’n in your armours, as you are addressed,
Your limbs will well become a soldier’s dance.
I will not have excuse with saying this,
‘Loud music is too harsh for ladies’ heads’,
Since they love men in arms as well as beds.
