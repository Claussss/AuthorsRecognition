A Lord is going
What, dost thou go? Soft, take thy physic first. Thou too, and thou. He beats them Stay, I will lend thee money, borrow none. Exeunt Lords, leaving caps and gowns What, all in motion? Henceforth be no feast
Whereat a villainâ€™s not a welcome guest.
Burn house! Sink Athens! Henceforth hated be
Of Timon man and all humanity!
