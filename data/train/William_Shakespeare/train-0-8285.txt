OTHELLO Nay, stay. Thou shouldst be honest. I should be wise, for honesty’s a fool,
And loses that it works for. OTHELLO By the world, I think my wife be honest, and think she is not.
I think that thou art just, and think thou art not.
I’ll have some proof. My name, that was as fresh
As Dian’s visage, is now begrimed and black
As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,
Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams,
I’ll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!
