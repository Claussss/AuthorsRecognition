Hastingsknocks at the gates of York RICHARD OF GLOUCESTER The gates made fast? Brother, I like not this.
For many men that stumble at the threshold
Are well foretold that danger lurks within. KING EDWARD Tush, man, abodements must not now affright us.
By fair or foul means we must enter in,
For hither will our friends repair to us.
