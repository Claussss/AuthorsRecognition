They knock, and Titus aloftopens his study door Who doth molest my contemplation?
Is it your trick to make me ope the door,
That so my sad decrees may fly away
And all my study be to no effect?
You are deceived; for what I mean to do,
See here, in bloody lines I have set down,
And what is written shall be executed.
