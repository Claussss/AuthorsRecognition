QUEEN PHILIPPA Be this a token to express my joy— She kisses the Prince of Wales For inward passions will not let me speak. PRINCE OF WALES (to King Edward) My gracious father, here receive thy gift,
This wreath of conquest and reward of war,
Got with as mickle peril of our lives
As e’er was thing of price before this day.
Install your highness in your proper right,
And herewithal I render to your hands
These prisoners, chief occasion of our strife.
