Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak.
Ne‘er may he live to see a sunshine day
That cries ‘retire if Warwick bid him stay. Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean,
And when thou fail’st—as God forbid the hour—
Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forfend I No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York;
The next degree is England’s royal throne—
For King of England shalt thou be proclaimed
In every borough as we pass along,
And he that throws not up his cap for joy,
Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head.
King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague—
Stay we no longer dreaming of renown,
But sound the trumpets and about our task.
