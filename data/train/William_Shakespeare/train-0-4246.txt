Why, here walk I in the black brow of night
To find you out. BASTARD Brief, then, and what’s the news? O my sweet sir, news fitting to the night:
Black, fearful, comfortless, and horrible. Show me the very wound of this ill news;
I am no woman, I’ll not swoon at it. The King, I fear, is poisoned by a monk.
I left him almost speechless, and broke out
To acquaint you with this evil, that you might
The better arm you to the sudden time
Than if you had at leisure known of this.
