Narcissus so himself himself forsook,
And died to kiss his shadow in the brook. ‘Torches are made to light, jewels to wear,
Dainties to taste, fresh beauty for the use,
Herbs for their smell, and sappy plants to bear.
Things growing to themselves are growth’s abuse. Seeds spring from seeds, and beauty breedeth
beauty:
Thou wast begot; to get it is thy duty.
