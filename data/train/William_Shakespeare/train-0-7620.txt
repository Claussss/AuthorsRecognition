I go, my noble lord. We’ll straight go tell his highness these good news.
Withal, Sheriff More, I’ll tell him how your breath
Hath ransomed many a subject from sad death. Exit Lincoln and Sherwin, you shall both to Newgate,
The rest unto the Counters. Go, guard them hence. A little breath well spent
Cheats expectation in his fair’st event.
