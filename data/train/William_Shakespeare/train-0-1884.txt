LADY ANNE All men, I hope, live so. RICHARD GLOUCESTER Vouchsafe to wear this ring. LADY ANNE To take is not to give. RICHARD GLOUCESTER Look how my ring encompasseth thy finger;
Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart.
Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.
And if thy poor devoted servant may
But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,
Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.
