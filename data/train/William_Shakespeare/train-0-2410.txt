Who with a ling’ring stay his course doth let
Till every minute pays the hour his debt. ‘So, so,’ quoth he, ‘these lets attend the time,
Like little frosts that sometime threat the spring
To add a more rejoicing to the prime,
And give the sneap
Pain pays the income of each precious thing. Huge rocks, high winds, strong pirates, shelves, and sands
The merchant fears, ere rich at home he lands.’
