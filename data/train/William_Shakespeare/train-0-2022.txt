He for his father’s sake so loves the Prince
That he will not be won to aught against him. What think’st thou then of Stanley? Will not he? He will do all-in-all as Hastings doth. Well then, no more but this. Go, gentle Catesby,
And, as it were far off, sound thou Lord Hastings
How he doth stand affected to our purpose.
If thou dost find him tractable to us,
Encourage him, and tell him all our reasons.
If he be leaden, icy, cold, unwilling,
Be thou so too, and so break off your talk,
And give us notice of his inclination,
For we tomorrow hold divided counsels,
Wherein thyself shalt highly be employed.
