BIANCA Leave you? Wherefore? I do attend here on the general,
And think it no addition, nor my wish,
To have him see me womaned. BIANCA Why, I pray you? Not that I love you not. BIANCA But that you do not love me. I pray you bring me on the way a little,
And say if I shall see you soon at night. ’Tis but a little way that I can bring you,
For I attend here; but I’ll see you soon.
