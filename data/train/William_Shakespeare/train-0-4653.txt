I do not care. I’ll give thrice so much land
To any well-deserving friend;
But in the way of bargain—mark ye me—135
I’ll cavil on the ninth part of a hair.
Are the indentures drawn? Shall we be gone? The moon shines fair. You may away by night.
I’ll haste the writer, and withal
Break with your wives of your departure hence.
I am afraid my daughter will run mad,
So much she doteth on her Mortimer. Exit
