HUBERT I can heat it, boy. No, in good sooth: the fire is dead with grief, 105
Being create for comfort, to be used
In undeserved extremes. See else yourself.
There is no malice in this burning coal;
The breath of heaven hath blown his spirit out,
And strewed repentant ashes on his head. II0 But with my breath I can revive it, boy.
