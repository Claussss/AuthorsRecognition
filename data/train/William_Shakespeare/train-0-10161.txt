Enter a Gentlewoman GENTLEWOMAN Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you. VIRGILIA (to Volumnia) Beseech you give me leave to retire myself. VOLUMNIA Indeed you shall not. Methinks I hear hither your husband’s drum,
See him pluck Aufidius down by th’ hair;
As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him.
Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:
‘Come on, you cowards, you were got in fear
Though you were born in Rome!’ His bloody brow
With his mailed hand then wiping, forth he goes,
Like to a harvest-man that’s tasked to mow
Or all or lose his hire.
