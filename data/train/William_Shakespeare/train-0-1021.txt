Let me have some bands of chosen soldiers,
And York shall try his fortune â€˜gainst those kerns. QUEEN MARGARET York, thou shalt. My lord of Buckingham,
Let it be your charge to muster up such soldiers
As shall suffice him in these needful wars. Madam, I will, and levy such a band
As soon shall overcome those Irish rebels.
But, York, where shall those soldiers stay for thee?
