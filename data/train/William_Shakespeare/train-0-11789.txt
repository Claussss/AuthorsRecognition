The King takes his seat and whispers with Lovell, who then goes to the Cardinal CARDINAL WOLSEY Heaven forgive me! To the King Good my lord, You are full of heavenly stuff, and bear the inventory
Of your best graces in your mind, the which
You were now running oâ€™er. You have scarce time
To steal from spiritual leisure a brief span
To keep your earthly audit. Sure, in that,
I deem you an ill husband, and am glad
To have you therein my companion.
