Thou art a lord, and nothing but a lord.
Thou hast a lady far more beautiful
Than any woman in this waning age. FIRST SERVINGMAN And till the tears that she hath shed for thee
Like envious floods o’errun her lovely face
She was the fairest creature in the world;
And yet she is inferior to none. Am I a lord, and have I such a lady?
Or do I dream? Or have I dreamed till now?
I do not sleep. I see, I hear, I speak.
I smell sweet savours, and I feel soft things.
Upon my life, I am a lord indeed,
And not a tinker, nor Christopher Sly.
Well, bring our lady hither to our sight,
And once again a pot o’th’ smallest ale.
