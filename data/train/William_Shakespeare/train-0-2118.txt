Enter the old Duchess of York and Queen Elizabeth  Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret. Who comes here? QUEEN ELIZABETH Ah, my poor princes! Ah, my tender babes!
My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!
If yet your gentle souls fly in the air,
And be not fixed in doom perpetual,
Hover about me with your airy wings
And hear your motherâ€™s lamentation.
