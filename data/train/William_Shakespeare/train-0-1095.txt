Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,
Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay.
O Clifford, boist’rous Clifford—thou hast slain
The flower of Europe for his chivalry,
And treacherously hast thou vanquished him—
For hand to hand he would have vanquished thee.
Now my soul’s palace is become a prison.
Ah, would she break from hence that this my body
Might in the ground be closed up in rest.
For never henceforth shall I joy again—
Never, O never, shall I see more joy.
