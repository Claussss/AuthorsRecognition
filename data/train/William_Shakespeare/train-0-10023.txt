MARINA My thanks, sweet madam. Exit Dionyza Is this wind westerly that blows? LEONINE South-west. When I was born the wind was north. LEONINE Was’t SO? MARINA My father, as nurse says, did never fear,
But cried ’Good seamen’ to the mariners,
Galling his kingly hands with haling ropes,
And, clasping to the mast, endured a sea
That almost burst the deck.
