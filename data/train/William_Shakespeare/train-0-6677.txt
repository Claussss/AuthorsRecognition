Hamlet leaps in after Laertes LAERTES The devil take thy soul. HAMLET Thou prayâ€™st not well. I prithee take thy fingers from my throat,
For though I am not splenative and rash,
Yet have I something in me dangerous,
Which let thy wiseness fear. Away thy hand. KING CLAUDIUS (to Lords) Pluck them asunder.
