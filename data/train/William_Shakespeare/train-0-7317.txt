Wilt thou not, beast, abide? Why then, fly on; Iâ€™ll hunt thee for thy hide. Exit  5.7
Enter Achilles with Myrmidons Come here about me, you my Myrmidons.
Mark what I say. Attend me where I wheel;
Strike not a stroke, but keep yourselves in breath,

In fellest manner execute your arms.
Follow me, sirs, and my proceedings eye.
It is decreed Hector the great must die. Exeunt
