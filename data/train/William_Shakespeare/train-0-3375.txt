Enter Green God save your majesty, and well met, gentlemen.
I hope the King is not yet shipped for Ireland. Why hop‘st thou so? ’Tis better hope he is,
For his designs crave haste, his haste good hope.
Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipped? That he, our hope, might have retired his power,
And driven into despair an enemy’s hope,
Who strongly hath set footing in this land.
The banished Bolingbroke repeals himself,
And with uplifted arms is safe arrived
At Ravenspurgh.
