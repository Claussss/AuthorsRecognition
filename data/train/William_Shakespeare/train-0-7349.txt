And all in war with time for love of you, As he takes from you, I engraft you new.
16 But wherefore do not you a mightier way
Make war upon this bloody tyrant, time,
And fortify yourself in your decay
With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?
Now stand you on the top of happy hours,
And many maiden gardens yet unset
With virtuous wish would bear your living flowers,
Much liker than your painted counterfeit.
So should the lines of life that life repair
Which this timeâ€™s pencil or my pupil pen
Neither in inward worth nor outward fair
Can make you live yourself in eyes of men.
