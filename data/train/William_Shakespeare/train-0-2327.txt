Who doth the world so gloriously behold
That cedar tops and hills seem burnished gold. Venus salutes him with this fair good-morrow:
‘O thou clear god, and patron of all light,
From whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow
The beauteous influence that makes him bright: There lives a son that sucked an earthly mother
May lend thee light, as thou dost lend to other.’
