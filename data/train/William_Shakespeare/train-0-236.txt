Good company. With them shall Proteus go. Enter Proteus with a letter. He does not see Antonio and Panthino And in good time. Now will we break with him. PROTEUS Sweet love, sweet lines, sweet life! Here is her hand, the agent of her heart.
Here is her oath for love, her honourâ€™s pawn.
O that our fathers would applaud our loves
To seal our happiness with their consents.
O heavenly Julia!
