SECOND SUPPLICANT Long live your highness! Happy be your reign! KING EDWARD (to the six Supplicants) Go, get you hencel Return unto the town.
And if this kindness hath deserved your love,
Learn then to reverence Edward as your king. Exeunt the six Supplicants Now might we hear of our affairs abroad,
We would till gloomy winter were oâ€™erspent
Dispose our men in garrison a while.
