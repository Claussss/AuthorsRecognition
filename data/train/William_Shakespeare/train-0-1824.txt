SATURNINUS Marchs, we will. Hautboys. A table brought in.They sit.
Enter Titus like a cook, placing the dishes, and
Lavinia with a veil over her face; young Lucius,
and others Welcome, my gracious lord; welcome, dread Queen;
Welcome, ye warlike Goths; welcome, Lucius;
And welcome, all. Although the cheer be poor,
â€˜Twill fill your stomachs. Please you, eat of it.
