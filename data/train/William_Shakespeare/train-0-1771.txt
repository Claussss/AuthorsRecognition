Aaron, I see thou wilt not trust the air
With secrets. For this care of Tamora, Herself and hers are highly bound to thee. Exeunt Chiron and Demetrius with the Nurse’s body Now to the Goths, as swift as swallow flies,
There to dispose this treasure in mine arms
And secretly to greet the Empress’ friends.
Come on, you thick-lipped slave, I’ll bear you hence,
For it is you that puts us to our shifts.
I’ll make you feed on berries and on roots,
And fat on curds and whey, and suck the goat,
And cabin in a cave, and bring you up
To be a warrior and command a camp.
