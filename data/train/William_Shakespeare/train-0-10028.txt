These roguing thieves serve the great pirate Valdes.
An they have seized Marina, let her go.
There’s no hope she’ll return. I’ll swear she’s dead
And thrown into the sea; but I’ll see further.
Perhaps they will but please themselves upon her,
Not carry her aboard. If she remain,
Whom they have ravished must by me be slain.
