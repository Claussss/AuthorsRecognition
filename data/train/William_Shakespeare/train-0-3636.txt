I would I were thy bird. JULIET Sweet, so would I. Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
Good night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow
That I shall say good night till it be morrow. Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast. Exit Juliet  Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest.
Hence will I to my ghostly sireâ€™s close cell,
His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.
