But say that one Had rather combat me? Let that one say so, And use thy freedom; else, if thou pursuest her,
Be as that cursed man that hates his country,
A branded villain. You are mad. I must be. Till thou art worthy, Arcite, it concerns me;
And in this madness if I hazard thee
And take thy life, I deal but truly.
