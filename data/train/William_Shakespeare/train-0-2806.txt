ALL SIX SUPPLICANTS coming forward Mercy, King Edward! Mercy, gracious lord! KING EDWARD Contemptuous villains, call ye now for truce?
Mine ears are stopped against your bootless cries.
Sound drums alarum, draw threat’ning swords! FIRST SUPPLICANT Ah, noble prince, take pity on this town,
And hear us, mighty King.
We claim the promise that your highness made—
The two days’ respite is not yet expired,
And we are come with willingness to bear
What torturing death or punishment you please,
So that the trembling multitude be saved.
