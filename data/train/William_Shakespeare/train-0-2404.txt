As corn o‘ergrown by weeds, so heedful fear
Is almost choked by unresisted lust.
Away he steals, with open list’ning ear,
Full of foul hope and full of fond mistrust,
Both which as servitors to the unjust So cross him with their opposite persuasion
That now he vows a league, and now invasion. Within his thought her heavenly image sits,
And in the selfsame seat sits Collatine.
That eye which looks on her confounds his wits,
That eye which him beholds, as more divine,
Unto a view so false will not incline,
