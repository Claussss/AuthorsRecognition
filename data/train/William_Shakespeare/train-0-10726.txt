FLORIZEL (to Perdita) Dear, look up. Though fortune, visible an enemy,
Should chase us with my father, power no jot
Hath she to change our loves.â€”Beseech you, sir,
Remember since you owed no more to time
Than I do now. With thought of such affections,
Step forth mine advocate. At your request
My father will grant precious things as trifles.
