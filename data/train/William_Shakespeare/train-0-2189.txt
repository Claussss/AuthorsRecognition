Enter above GHOST OF KING HENRY (to Richard) When I was mortal, my anointed body
By thee was punched full of deadly holes.
Think on the Tower and me. Despair and die.
Harry the Sixth bids thee despair and die.
(To Richmond) Virtuous and holy, be thou conqueror.
Harry that prophesied thou shouldst be king
Comforts thee in thy sleep. Live and flourish! Exit
