Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul
But I do love thee, and when I love thee not,
Chaos is come again. IAGO My noble lord. OTHELLO What dost thou say, Iago? Did Michael Cassio, when you wooed my lady,
Know of your love? He did, from first to last. Why dost thou ask? But for a satisfaction of my thought,
No further harm.
