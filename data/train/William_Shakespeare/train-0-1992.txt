SECOND CITIZEN Truly the hearts of men are full of fear.
You cannot reason almost with a man
That looks not heavily and full of dread. THIRD CITIZEN Before the days of change still is it so.
By a divine instinct men’s minds mistrust
Ensuing danger, as by proof we see
The water swell before a boist’rous storm.
But leave it all to God. Whither away?
