My poverty but not my will consents. I pay thy poverty and not thy will. APOTHECARY (handing Romeo poison) Put this in any liquid thing you will
And drink it off, and if you had the strength
Of twenty men it would dispatch you straight. ROMEO (giving money) There is thy gold—worse poison to men’s souls, 80
Doing more murder in this loathsome world,
Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
Farewell, buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
