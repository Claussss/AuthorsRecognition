SICINIUS We are convented Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts
Inclinable to honour and advance
The theme of our assembly. BRUTUS Which the rather We shall be blessed to do if he remember
A kinder value of the people than
He hath hereto prized them at. MENENIUS That’s off, that’s off. I would you rather had been silent. Please you
To hear Cominius speak?
