HOTSPUR Speak of Mortimer? Zounds, I will speak of him, and let my soul
Want mercy if I do not join with him.
In his behalf Iâ€™ll empty all these veins,
And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,
But I will lift the downfall Mortimer
As high in the air as this unthankful King,
As this ingrate and cankered Bolingbroke.
