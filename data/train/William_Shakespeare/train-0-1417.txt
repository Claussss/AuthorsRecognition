Enter the Countess of Auvergne and her Porter Porter, remember what I gave in charge,
And when you have done so, bring the keys to me. PORTER Madam, I will. Exit The plot is laid. If all things fall out right,
I shall as famous be by this exploit
As Scythian Tomyris by Cyrusâ€™ death.
Great is the rumour of this dreadful knight,
And his achievements of no less account.
Fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears,
To give their censure of these rare reports.
