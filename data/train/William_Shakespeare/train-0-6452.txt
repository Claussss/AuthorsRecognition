There’s ne’er a villain dwelling in all Denmark
But he’s an arrant knave. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
To tell us this. Why, right, you are i’th’ right,
And so without more circumstance at all
I hold it fit that we shake hands and part,
You as your business and desires shall point you—
For every man has business and desire,
Such as it is—and for mine own poor part,
Look you, I’ll go pray.
