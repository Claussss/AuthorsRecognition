O, Clifford, how thy words revive my heart! Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.
What mutter you, or what conspire you, lords? Do right unto this princely Duke of York,
Or I will fill the house with armed men
And over the chair of state, where now he sits,
Write up his title with usurping blood.
He stamps with his foot and the soldiers show
themselves
