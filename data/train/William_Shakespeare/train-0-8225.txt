Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger. 1
Your officer Iago can inform you,
While I spare speech—which something now offends
me—
Of all that I do know; nor know I aught
By me that’s said or done amiss this night,
Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,
And to defend ourselves it be a sin
When violence assails us.
