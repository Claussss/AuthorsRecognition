KING CLAUDIUS I pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him. Exit Horatio
(To Laertes).Strengthen your patience in our last
night’s speech.
We’ll put the matter to the present push.—
Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.—
This grave shall have a living monument.
An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
Till then, in patience our proceeding be.
