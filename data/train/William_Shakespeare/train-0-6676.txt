He leaps into the grave Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
Till of this flat a mountain you have made
To o’ertop old Pelion, or the skyish head
Of blue Olympus. HAMLET (coming forward) What is he whose grief Bears such an emphasis, whose phrase of sorrow
Conjures the wand’ring stars and makes them stand
Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
Hamlet the Dane.
