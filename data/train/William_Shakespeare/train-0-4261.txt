And the like tender of our love we make,
To rest without a spot for evermore. Salisbury, Pembroke and Bigot kneel PRINCE HENRY I have a kind of soul that would give thanks,
And knows not how to do it but with tears.
He weeps BASTARD rising O, let us pay the time but needful woe,
Since it hath been beforehand with our griefs.
This England never did, nor never shall,
Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror
But when it first did help to wound itself.
Now these her princes are come home again,
Come the three corners of the world in arms
And we shall shock them. Naught shall make us rue
If England to itself do rest but true.
