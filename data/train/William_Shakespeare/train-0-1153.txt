SECOND GAMEKEEPER I’ll stay above the hill, so both may shoot. FIRST GAMEKEEPER That cannot be—the noise of thy crossbow
Will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost.
Here stand we both, and aim we at the best.
And, for the time shall not seem tedious,
I’ll tell thee what befell me on a day
In this self place where now we mean to stand.
