LYSANDER (to Hermia) Hang off, thou cat, thou burr; vile thing, let loose,
Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent. Why are you grown so rude? What change is this,
Sweet love? LYSANDER Thy love? Out, tawny Tartar, out; Out, loathed medâ€™cine; O hated potion, hence. Do you not jest? HELENA Yes, sooth, and so do you.
