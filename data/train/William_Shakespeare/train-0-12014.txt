THESEUS You are perfect. Upon my soul, a proper man. PIRITHOUS (to Hippolyta) How do you like him, lady? I admire him. I have not seen so young a man so noble—
If he say true—of his sort. Believe His mother was a wondrous handsome woman—
His face methinks goes that way. But his body And fiery mind illustrate a brave father.
