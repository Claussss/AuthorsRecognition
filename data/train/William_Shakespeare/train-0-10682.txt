CAMILLO Unbuckle, unbuckle. Florizel and Autolycus exchange clothes (To Perdita) Fortunate mistress—let my prophecy
Come home to ye!—you must retire yourself
Into some covert, take your sweetheart’s hat
And pluck it o’er your brows, muffle your face,
Dismantle you, and, as you can, disliken
The truth of your own seeming, that you may—
For I do fear eyes—over to shipboard
Get undescried.
