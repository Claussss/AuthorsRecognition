ABERGAVENNY Kinsmen of mine—three at the least—that have
By this so sickened their estates that never
They shall abound as formerly. Have broke their backs with laying manors on ’em
For this great journey. What did this vanity
But minister communication of
A most poor issue? Grievingly I think The peace between the French and us not values
The cost that did conclude it.
