Then, if you can Be pale, I beg but leave to air this jewel. See! He shows the bracelet And now ’tis up again; it must be married
To that your diamond. I’ll keep them. Once more let me behold it. Is it that
Which I left with her? Sir, I thank her, that. She stripped it from her arm. I see her yet.
Her pretty action did outsell her gift,
And yet enriched it too. She gave it me,
And said she prized it once.
