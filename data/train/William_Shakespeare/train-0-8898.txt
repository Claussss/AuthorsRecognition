FIRST SENATOR Do you dare our anger? ’Tis in few words, but spacious in effect:
We banish thee for ever. Banish your dotage, banish usury
That makes the senate ugly. FIRST SENATOR If after two days’ shine Athens contain thee, attend our weightier judgement;
And, not to swell your spirit, he shall be
Executed presently.
