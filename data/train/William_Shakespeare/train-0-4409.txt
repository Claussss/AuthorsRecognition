Jailer, look to him. Tell not me of mercy.
This is the fool that lent out money gratis.
Jailer, look to him. ANTONIO Hear me yet, good Shylock. I’ll have my bond. Speak not against my bond.
I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.
Thou called’st me dog before thou hadst a cause,
But since I am a dog, beware my fangs.
The Duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder,
Thou naughty jailer, that thou art so fond
To come abroad with him at his request.
