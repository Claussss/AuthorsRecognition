RICHARD PLANTAGENET Tut, tut, here is a mannerly forbearance.
The truth appears so naked on my side
That any purblind eye may find it out. And on my side it is so well apparelled,
So clear, so shining, and so evident,
That it will glimmer through a blind manâ€™s eye. RICHARD PLANTAGENET Since you are tongue-tied and so loath to speak,
In dumb significants proclaim your thoughts.
Let him that is a true-born gentleman
And stands upon the honour of his birth,
If he suppose that I have pleaded truth,
From off this briar pluck a white rose with me.
