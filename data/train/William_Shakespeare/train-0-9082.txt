good father, Thou seest the heavens, as troubled with man’s act,
Threatens his bloody stage. By th’ clock ’tis day,
And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp.
Is’t night’s predominance or the day’s shame
That darkness does the face of earth entomb
When living light should kiss it? ’Tis unnatural,
