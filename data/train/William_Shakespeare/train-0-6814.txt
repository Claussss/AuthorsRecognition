The gentleness of all the gods go with thee!
I have many enemies in Orsino’s court,
Else would I very shortly see thee there.
But come what may, I do adore thee so
That danger shall seem sport, and I will go. Exit  2.2
Enter Viola as Cesario, and Malvolio, at several doors 
MALVOLIO Were not you ev’n now with the Countess Olivia?
