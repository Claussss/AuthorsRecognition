COLEVILLE Are not you Sir John Falstaff? 10 SIR JOHN As good a man as he, sir, whoeâ€™er I am. Do ye yield, sir, or shall I sweat for you? If I do sweat, they are the drops of thy lovers, and they weep for thy death; therefore rouse up fear and trembling, and do observance to my mercy. 15 COLEVILLE (kneeling) I think you are Sir John Falstaff, and in that thought yield me.
