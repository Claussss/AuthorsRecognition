QUEEN MARGARET My lord, cheer up your spirits—our foes are nigh,
And this soft courage makes your followers faint.
You promised knighthood to our forward son.
Unsheathe your sword and dub him presently.
Edward, kneel down. Prince Edward kneels Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight—
And learn this lesson: draw thy sword in right.
