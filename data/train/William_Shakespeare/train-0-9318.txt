Whilst you abide here. ENOBARBUS Humbly, sir, I thank you.

Enter Antony and Caesar; Octavia between them The world and my great office will sometimes
Divide me from your bosom. All which time, Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers
To them for you. Good night, sir. My Octavia, Read not my blemishes in the world’s report.
I have not kept my square, but that to come
Shall all be done by th’ rule. Good night, dear lady.
Good night, sir.
