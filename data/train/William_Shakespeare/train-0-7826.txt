Sir, we have seen far better days than these. I was the patron of those days, and know
Those were but painted days, only for show.
Then grieve not you to fall with him that gave them.
Pro eris generosis servis gloriosum mori.
Dear Gough, thou art my learn
You, Master Catesby, steward of my house;
The rest, like you, have had fair time to grow
In sunshine of my fortunes. But I must tell ye,
Corruption is fled hence with each man’s office—
Bribes, that make open traffic twixt the soul
And netherland of hell, deliver up
Their guilty homage to their second lords.
Then, living thus untainted, you are well.
Truth is no pilot for the land of hell.
