What sayst thou? Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That’s twice. How should that be? But entertain it And, though thou think me poor, I am the man
Will give thee all the world. Hast thou drunk well? No, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
Thou art, if thou dar‘st be, the earthly Jove.
Whate’er the ocean pales or sky inclips
Is thine, if thou wilt ha’t.
