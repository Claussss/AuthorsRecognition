Ay, if you thought your love not cast away. Why, he of all the rest hath never moved me. Yet he of all the rest I think best loves ye. His little speaking shows his love but small. Fire thatâ€™s closest kept burns most of all. They do not love that do not show their love. O, they love least that let men know their love.
