And must we be divided? Must we part? Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart. Banish us both, and send the King with me. That were some love, but little policy. Then whither he goes, thither let me go. So two together weeping make one woe.
Weep thou for me in France, I for thee here.
Better far off than, near, be ne’er the nea’er.
Go count thy way with sighs, I mine with groans.
