Arcite, thou mightst now poison me. I might—But I must fear you first. Sit down and, good now,
No more of these vain parleys. Let us not,

Make talk for fools and cowards. To your health, sir. Arcite drinks ARCITE Pray sit down, then, and let me entreat you, By all the honesty and honour in you, No mention of this woman—’twilt disturb us. We shall have time enough.
