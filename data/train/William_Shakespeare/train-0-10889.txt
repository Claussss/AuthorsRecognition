That sir which serves and seeks for gain
And follows but for form,
Will pack when it begin to rain,
And leave thee in the storm. But I will tarry, the fool will stay,
And let the wise man fly.
The knave turns fool that runs away,
The fool no knave, pardie. KENT Where learned you this, Fool? FOOL Not i’th’ stocks, fool.
