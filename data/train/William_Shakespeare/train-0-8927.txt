As thine is now, held with a brace of harlots. Is this thâ€™Athenian minion, whom the world
Voiced so regardfully? SIMON Art thou Timandra? TIMANDRA Yes. Be a whore still. They love thee not that use thee.
Give them diseases, leaving with thee their lust.
Make use of thy salt hours: season the slaves
For tubs and baths, bring down rose-cheeked youth
To the tub-fast and the diet.
