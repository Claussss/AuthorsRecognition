Exit
K. After ‘accident’ at 4.7.67, Q2 has these additional lines: My lord, I will be ruled,
The rather if you could devise it so
That I might be the organ. KING CLAUDIUS It falls right.

And that in Hamlet’s hearing, for a quality
Wherein they say you shine. Your sum of parts
Did not together pluck such envy from him
As did that one, and that, in my regard,
Of the unworthiest siege.
