Yet, cousin, Even from the bottom of these miseries,
From all that fortune can inflict upon us,
I see two comforts risingâ€”two mere blessings,
If the gods please, to hold here a brave patience
And the enjoying of our griefs together.
Whilst Palamon is with me, let me perish
If I think this our prison.
