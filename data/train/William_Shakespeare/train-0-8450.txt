CORDELIA (aside) What shall Cordelia do? Love and be silent. LEAR (to Gonoril) Of all these bounds even from this line to this,
With shady forests and wide skirted meads,
We make thee lady. To thine and Albany’s issue
Be this perpetual.—What says our second daughter?
Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall, speak.
