Your virtue is my privilege, for that 220
It is not night when I do see your face;
Therefore I think I am not in the night,
Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company;
For you in my respect are all the world.
Then how can it be said I am alone, 225
When all the world is here to look on me? Iâ€™ll run from thee, and hide me in the brakes,
And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.
