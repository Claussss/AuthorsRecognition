For quiet days, fair issue, and long life
With such love as ’tis now, the murkiest den,
The most opportune place, the strong’st suggestion
Our worser genius can, shall never melt
Mine honour into lust to take away
The edge of that day’s celebration;
When I shall think or Phoebus’ steeds are foundered
Or night kept chained below.
