How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnial
I am ashamed I did yield to them.
Give me my robe, for I will go. Enter Cassius,Brutus, Ligarius, Metellus, Casca, Trebonius, and Cinna And look where Cassius is come to fetch me. Good morrow, Caesar. CAESAR Welcome, Cassius.— What, Brutus, are you stirred so early too?—
Good morrow, Casca.—Caius Ligarius,
Caesar was ne‘er so much your enemy
As that same ague which hath made you lean.
What is’t o’clock?
