CARDINAL WOLSEY aside How much, methinks, I could despise this man,
But that I am bound in charity against it. NORFOLK (to Surrey) Those articles, my lord, are in the King’s hand;
But thus much—they are foul ones. CARDINAL WOLSEY So much fairer And spotless shall mine innocence arise
When the King knows my truth.
