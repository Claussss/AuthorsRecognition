THESEUS (to First Queen) Sad lady, rise. HIPPOLYTA (to Second Queen) Stand up. EMILIA (to Third Queen) No knees to me. What woman I may stead that is distressed
Does bind me to her. THESEUS (to First Queen) What’s your request? Deliver you for all. FIRST QUEEN kneeling still We are three queens whose sovereigns fell before
The wrath of cruel Creon; who endured
The beaks of ravens, talons of the kites,
And pecks of crows in the foul fields of Thebes.
He will not suffer us to burn their bones,
To urn their ashes, nor to take th‘offence
Of mortal loathsomeness from the blest eye
Of holy Phoebus, but infects the winds
With stench of our slain lords. O pity, Duke!
Thou purger of the earth, draw thy feared sword
That does good turns to’th’ world; give us the bones
Of our dead kings that we may chapel them;
And of thy boundless goodness take some note
That for our crowned heads we have no roof,
Save this, which is the lion’s and the bear’s,
And vault to everything.
