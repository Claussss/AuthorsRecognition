And you, good sir. Pray, have you not a daughter
Called Katherina, fair and virtuous? I have a daughter, sir, called Katherina. You are too blunt. Go to it orderly. You wrong me, Signor Gremio. Give me leave.
(To Baptista) I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,
That hearing of her beauty and her wit,
Her affability and bashful modesty,
Her wondrous qualities and mild behaviour,
Am bold to show myself a forward guest
Within your house to make mine eye the witness
Of that report which I so oft have heard,
And for an entrance to my entertainment
I do present you with a man of mine (presenting
Hortensio)
Cunning in music and the mathematics
To instruct her fully in those sciences,
Whereof I know she is not ignorant.
Accept of him, or else you do me wrong.
His name is Licio, born in Mantua.
