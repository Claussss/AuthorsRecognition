The King himself, who, Douglas, grieves at heart
So many of his shadows thou hast met
And not the very King. I have two boys
Seek Percy and thyself about the field;
But seeing thou fall’st on me so luckily,
I will assay thee; and defend thyself. I fear thou art another counterfeit; And yet, in faith, thou bear’st thee like a king.
