Shakespeare was writing in the middle of a period of English linguistic history called Early Modern English, which runs from around 1500 to around 1750. It was an age when the language was beginning to settle down after a turbulent few centuries when its structure radically altered from its Anglo-Saxon character. Old English (used until the twelfth century) is so different from Modern English that it has to be approached as we would a foreign language. Middle English (used until the fifteenth century) is very much more familiar to modern eyes and ears, but we still feel that a considerable linguistic distance separates us from those who wrote in it - Chaucer and his contemporaries. During the fifteenth century, a huge amount of change affected English pronunciation, spelling, grammar, and vocabulary, so that Shakespeare would have found Chaucer almost as difficult to read as we do. But between Jacobethan times and today the changes have been very limited. Although we must not underestimate the problems posed by such words as buff jerkin, finical, and thou, we must not exaggerate them either. Most of Early Modern English is the same as Modern English. The evidence lies in the fact that there are many lines of Shakespeare where we feel little or no linguistic distance at all:
BRUTUS ... If there be any in this assembly, any dear
 friend of Caesar’s, to him I say that Brutus’ love to
 Caesar was no less than his. If then that friend
 demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my
 answer: not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved
 Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living,
 and die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to
 live all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for
 him. As he was fortunate, I rejoice at it. As he was
 valiant, I honour him. But as he was ambitious, I
 slew him.
