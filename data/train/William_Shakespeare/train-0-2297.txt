He tells her no, tomorrow he intends
To hunt the boar with certain of his friends. ‘The boar!’ quoth she; whereat a sudden pale,
Like lawn being spread upon the blushing rose,
Usurps her cheek. She trembles at his tale,
And on his neck her yoking arms she throws. She sinketh down, still hanging by his neck.
He on her belly falls, she on her back.
