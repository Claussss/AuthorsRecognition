TRINCULO Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool! STEFANO There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that, monster, but an infinite loss. TRINCULO That’s more to me than my wetting. Yet this is your harmless fairy, monster. STEFANO I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o’er ears for my labour. Prithee, my king, be quiet. Seest thou here;
This is the mouth o’th’ cell. No noise, and enter.
Do that good mischief which may make this island
Thine own for ever, and I thy Caliban
For aye thy foot-licker.
