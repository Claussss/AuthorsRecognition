SEBASTIAN (to Antonio) Fowl weather? GONZALO (to Alonso) Had I plantation of this isle, my lord— ANTONIO (to Seabastian) He’d sow’t with nettle-seed. Or docks, or mallows. And were the king on’t, what would I do? SEBASTIAN (to Antonio) Scape being drunk, for want of wine. I’th’ commonwealth I would by contraries
Execute all things. For no kind of traffic
Would I admit, no name of magistrate;
Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,
And use of service, none; contract, succession,
Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;
No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;
No occupation, all men idle, all;
And women too—but innocent and pure;
No sovereignty—
