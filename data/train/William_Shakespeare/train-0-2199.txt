Exeunt Richard and Ratcliffe  Enter the lords to Henry Earl of Richmond, sitting in his tent HENRY EARL OF RICHMOND Cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen,
That you have taâ€™en a tardy sluggard here. HENRY EARL OF RICHMOND The sweetest sleep and fairest boding dreams
That ever entered in a drowsy head
Have I since your departure had, my lords.
Methought their souls whose bodies Richard murdered
Came to my tent and cried on victory.
I promise you, my soul is very jocund
In the remembrance of so fair a dream.
How far into the morning is it, lords?
