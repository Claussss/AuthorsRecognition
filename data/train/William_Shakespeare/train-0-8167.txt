So please your grace, my ensign. A man he is of honesty and trust.
To his conveyance I assign my wife,
With what else needful your good grace shall think
To be sent after me. Let it be so. Good night to everyone. (To Brabanzio) And, noble
signor,
If virtue no delighted beauty lack,
Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.
