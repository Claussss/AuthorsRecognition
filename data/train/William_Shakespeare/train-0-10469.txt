He gives the Lords a paper Read it not, noble lords, But tell the traitor in the highest degree
He hath abused your powers. CORIOLANUS Traitor? How now? AUFIDIUS Ay, traitor, Martius. CORIOLANUS Martius? Ay, Martius, Caius Martius. Dost thou think
I’ll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol’n name,
‘Coriolanus’, in Corioles?
You lords and heads o‘th’ state, perfidiously
He has betrayed your business, and given up,
For certain drops of salt, your city, Rome—
I say your city—to his wife and mother,
Breaking his oath and resolution like
A twist of rotten silk, never admitting
Counsel o’th’ war. But at his nurse’s tears
He whined and roared away your victory,
That pages blushed at him, and men of heart
Looked wond’ring each at others.
