My lord, this is my daughter here asleep,
And this Lysander; this Demetrius is;
This Helena, old Nedarâ€™s Helena.
I wonder of their being here together. No doubt they rose up early to observe
The rite of May, and, hearing our intent,
Came here in grace of our solemnity.
But speak, Egeus : is not this the day
That Hermia should give answer of her choice?
