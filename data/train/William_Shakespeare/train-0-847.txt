CARDINAL BEAUFORT But I would have him dead, my lord of Suffolk,
Ere you can take due orders for a priest.
Say you consent and censure well the deed,
And Iâ€™ll provide his executioner;
I tender so the safety of my liege. Here is my hand; the deed is worthy doing. QUEEN MARGARET And SO say I. And I. And now we three have spoke it,
It skills not greatly who impugns our doom.
