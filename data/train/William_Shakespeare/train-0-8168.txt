Adieu, brave Moor. Use Desdemona well. Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see.
She has deceived her father, and may thee. Exeunt Duke, Brabanzio, Cassio, Senators, and officers My life upon her faith. Honest Iago,
My Desdemona must I leave to thee.
I prithee let thy wife attend on her,
And bring them after in the best advantage.
Come, Desdemona. I have but an hour
Of love, of worldly matter and direction
To spend with thee. We must obey the time.
