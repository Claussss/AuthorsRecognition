Before you fight the battle, ope this letter.
If you have victory, let the trumpet sound
For him that brought it. Wretched though I seem,
I can produce a champion that will prove
What is avouch
Your business of the world hath so an end.
Fortune love youâ€” ALBANY Stay till I have read the letter. EDGAR I was forbid it. 50
