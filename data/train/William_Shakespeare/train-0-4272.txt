Enter Bassanio, Lorenzo, and Graziano Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,
Graziano, and Lorenzo. Fare ye well.
We leave you now with better company. I would have stayed till I had made you merry
If worthier friends had not prevented me. Your worth is very dear in my regard.
I take it your own business calls on you,
And you embrace thâ€™occasion to depart.
