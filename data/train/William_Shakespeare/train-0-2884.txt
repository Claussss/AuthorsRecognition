Come, come, Antipholus, we dine too late. Exeunt into the Phoenix 3.1
Enter Antipholus of Ephesus, his man Dromio, Angelo the goldsmith, and Balthasar the merchant 
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Good Signor Angelo, you must excuse us all.
My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours.
Say that I lingered with you at your shop
To see the making of her carcanet,
And that tomorrow you will bring it home.—
But here’s a villain that would face me down
He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,
And charged him with a thousand marks in gold,
And that I did deny my wife and house.
Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?
