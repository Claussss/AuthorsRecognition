You are not worth the dust which the rude wind
Blows in your face. Milk-livered man, That bear’st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;
Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning
Thine honour from thy suffering— See thyself, devil. Proper deformity shows not in the fiend
So horrid as in woman. O vain fool!
