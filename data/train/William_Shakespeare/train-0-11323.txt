The battle continues. Alarums. Excursions. The trumpets sound a retreat.The Britons fly, Cymbeline is taken. Then enter to his rescue Belarius, Guiderius, and Arviragus Stand, stand, we have thâ€™advantage of the ground.
The lane is guarded. Nothing routs us but
The villainy of our fears. GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS Stand, stand, and fight.
