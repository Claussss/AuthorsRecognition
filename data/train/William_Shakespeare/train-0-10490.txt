Your guest then, madam. To be your prisoner should import offending,
Which is for me less easy to commit
Than you to punish. Not your jailer then, But your kind hostess. Come, I’ll question you
Of my lord’s tricks and yours when you were boys.
You were pretty lordings then? We were, fair Queen, Two lads that thought there was no more behind
But such a day tomorrow as today,
And to be boy eternal.
