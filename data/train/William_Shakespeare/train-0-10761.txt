THE TRAGEDY OF KING LEAR THE FOLIO TEXT THE text of King Lear given here represents the revision made probably three or four years after the first version had been written and performed; it is based on the text printed in the 1623 Folio. This is the more obviously theatrical text. It makes a number of significant cuts, amounting to some 300 lines. The most conspicuous ones are the dialogue in which Learddition, several speeches are differently assigned, and there are many variations in wording.
