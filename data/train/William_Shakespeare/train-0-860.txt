QUEEN MARGARET How fares my lord? Help, lordsâ€”the King is dead! Rear up his body; wring him by the nose. QUEEN MARGARET Run, go, help, help! O Henry, ope thine eyes! He doth revive again. Madam, be patient. O heavenly God! QUEEN MARGARET How fares my gracious lord? Comfort, my sovereign; gracious Henry, comfort.
