Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,
To come and sport.—Her peacocks fly amain.
Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain. Enter  Ceres Hail, many-coloured messenger, that ne’er
Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter;
Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers
Diffusest honey-drops, refreshing showers,
And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown
My bosky acres and my unshrubbed down,
Rich scarf to my proud earth. Why hath thy queen
Summoned me hither to this short-grassed green?
