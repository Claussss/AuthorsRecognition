What noise there, ho? No noise, my lord, but needful conference
About some gossips for your highness. Away with that audacious lady! Antigonus,
I charged thee that she should not come about me.
I knew she would. I told her so, my lord, On your displeasureâ€™s peril and on mine,
She should not visit you.
