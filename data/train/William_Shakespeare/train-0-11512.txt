TRINCULO O Stefano, hast any more of this? STEFANO The whole butt, man. My cellar is in a rock by th’ seaside, where my wine is hid. How now, moon-calf? How does thine ague? CALIBAN Hast thou not dropped from heaven? STEFANO Out o’th’ moon, I do assure thee. I was the man i’th’ moon when time was. I have seen thee in her, and I do adore thee.
My mistress showed me thee, and thy dog and thy bush.
