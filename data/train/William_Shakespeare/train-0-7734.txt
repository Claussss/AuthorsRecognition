ROPERâ€™S WIFE [aside to Roper] Truly, and so have I. Methought I saw him here in Chelsea church,
Standing upon the rood-loft, now defaced;
And whilst he kneeled and prayed before the image
It fell with him into the upper choir,
Where my poor father lay all stained in blood. ROPER [aside to his Wife] Our dreams all meet in one conclusion,
Fatal, I fear.
