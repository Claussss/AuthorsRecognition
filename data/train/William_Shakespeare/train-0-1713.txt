To rescue my two brothers from their death,
For which attempt the Judges have pronounced
My everlasting doom of banishment. TITUS rising O happy man, they have befriended thee!
Why, foolish Lucius, dost thou not perceive
That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers?
Tigers must prey, and Rome affords no prey
But me and mine. How happy art thou then
From these devourers to be banished!
But who comes with our brother Marcus here?
