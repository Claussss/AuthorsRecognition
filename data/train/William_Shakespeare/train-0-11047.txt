ALBANY (to the Herald) Ask him his purposes, why he appears
Upon this call o’th’ trumpet. HERALD (to Edgar) What are you? Your name, your quality, and why you answer
This present summons? Know, my name is lost, By treason’s tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit.
Yet am I noble as the adversary
I come to cope.
