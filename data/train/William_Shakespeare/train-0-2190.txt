Enter abovethe Ghost of George Duke of Clarence GHOST OF CLARENCE (to Richard) Let me sit heavy on thy soul tomorrow,
I that was washed to death with fulsome wine,
Poor Clarence, by thy guile betrayed to death.
Tomorrow in the battle think on me,
And fall thy edgeless sword. Despair and die.
(To Richmond) Thou offspring of the house of
Lancaster,
The wronged heirs of York do pray for thee.
Good angels guard thy battle. Live and flourish!
