SECOND SENATOR He has made too much plenty with ‘em.
He’s a sworn rioter; he has a sin
That often drowns him and takes his valour prisoner.
If there were no foes, that were enough
To overcome him. In that beastly fury
He has been known to commit outrages
And cherish factions. ’Tis inferred to us
His days are foul and his drink dangerous.
