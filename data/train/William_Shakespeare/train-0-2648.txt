KING EDWARD Swear, Countess, that thou wilt. COUNTESS OF SALISBURY By heaven, I will. KING EDWARD Then take thyself a little way aside
And tell thyself a king doth dote on thee.
Say that within thy power it doth lie
To make him happy, and that thou hast sworn
To give him all the joy within thy power-
Do this, and tell me when I shall be happy.
