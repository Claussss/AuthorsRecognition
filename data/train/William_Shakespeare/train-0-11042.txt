Mean you to enjoy him? The let-alone lies not in your good will. Nor in thine, lord. Half-blooded fellow, yes. REGAN (to Edmond) Let the drum strike and prove my title thine. Stay yet, hear reason. Edmond, I arrest thee
On capital treason, and in thy attaint
This gilded serpent. (To Regan) For your claim, fair
sister,
I bar it in the interest of my wife.
â€™Tis she is subcontracted to this lord,
And I, her husband, contradict your banns.
If you will marry, make your loves to me.
My lady is bespoke.
