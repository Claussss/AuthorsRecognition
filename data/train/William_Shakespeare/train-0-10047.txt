That she is dead. Nurses are not the fates.
To foster is not ever to preserve.
She died at night. I’ll say so. Who can cross it,
Unless you play the pious innocent
And, for an honest attribute, cry out
‘She died by foul play.’ CLEON O, go to. Well, well, Of all the faults beneath the heav’ns the gods
Do like this worst.
