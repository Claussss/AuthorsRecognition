KING OF FRANCE Dare he already crop the fleur-de-lis?
I hope, the honey being gathered thence,
He, with the spider, afterward approached,
Shall suck forth deadly venom from the leaves.
But whereâ€™s our navy? How are they prepared
To wing themselves against this flight of ravens? They, having knowledge brought them by the scouts,
Did break from anchor straight and, puffed with rage,
No otherwise than were their sails with wind,
Made forth as when the empty eagle flies
To satisfy his hungry, griping maw.
