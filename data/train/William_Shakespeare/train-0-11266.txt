I love thee: I have spoke it; How much the quantity, the weight as much,
As I do love my father. What, how, how? If it be sin to say so, sir, I yoke me
In my good brother’s fault. I know not why
I love this youth, and I have heard you say
Love’s reason’s without reason. The bier at door
And a demand who is’t shall die, I’d say
‘My father, not this youth’.
