And tell us what occasion of import
Hath all so long detained you from your wife
And sent you hither so unlike yourself? Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear.
Sufficeth I am come to keep my word,
Though in some part enforced to digress,
Which at more leisure I will so excuse
As you shall well be satisfied withal.
But where is Kate? I stay too long from her.
The morning wears, â€™tis time we were at church.
