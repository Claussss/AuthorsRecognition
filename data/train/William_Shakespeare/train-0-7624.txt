LORD MAYOR It shall be so. Enter Shrewsbury But yon, methinks, my lord of Shrewsbury. My lord, his majesty sends loving thanks
To you, your brethren, and his faithful subjects
Your careful citizens. But Master More, to you
A rougher yet as kind a salutation.
Your name is yet too short. Nay, you must kneel.
A knightâ€™s creation is this knightly steel.
