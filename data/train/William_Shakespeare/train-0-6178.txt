CELIA Will you go, coz? ROSALIND Have with you. (To Orlando) Fare you well. Exeunt Rosalind and Celia What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?
I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference. Enter Le Beau  O poor Orlando! Thou art overthrown.
Or Charles or something weaker masters thee. Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you
To leave this place. Albeit you have deserved
High commendation, true applause, and love,
Yet such is now the Dukeâ€™s condition
That he misconsters all that you have done.
The Duke is humorous. What he is indeed
More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.
