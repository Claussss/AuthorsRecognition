Enter Pericles Soft, here he comes. I must dissemble that
In show, I have determined on in heart. All fortune to the good Simonides. KING SIMONIDES To you as much, sir. I am beholden to you
For your sweet music this last night. My ears,
I do protest, were never better fed
With such delightful pleasing harmony.
