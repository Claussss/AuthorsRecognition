This is a thing Which you might from relation likewise reap,
Being, as it is, much spoke of. The roof o’th’ chamber With golden cherubins is fretted. Her andirons—
I had forgot them—were two winking Cupids
Of silver, each on one foot standing, nicely
Depending on their brands. This is her honour! Let it be granted you have seen all this—and praise
Be given to your remembrance—the description
Of what is in her chamber nothing saves
The wager you have laid.
