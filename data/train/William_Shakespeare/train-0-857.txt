FIRST MURDERER ’Tis, my good lord. Then draw the curtains close; away, be gone! Exeunt the Murderers, drawing the curtains as
 they leave Sound trumpets, then enter King Henry and Queen
Margaret, Cardinal Beaufort, the Duke of Somerset,
and attendants KING HENRY to Suffolk Go call our uncle to our presence straight.
Say we intend to try his grace today
If he be guilty, as ’tis published.
