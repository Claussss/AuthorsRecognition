It’s heaven’s will. Some spirit put this paper in the packet
To bless your eye withal. KING HENRY If we did think His contemplation were above the earth
And fixed on spiritual object, he should still
Dwell in his musings. But I am afraid
His thinkings are below the moon, not worth
His serious considering.
