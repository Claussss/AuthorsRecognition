LADY MACBETH Think of this, good peers, But as a thing of custom. ’Tis no other;
Only it spoils the pleasure of the time. MACBETH What man dare, I dare. Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,
The armed rhinoceros, or th‘Hyrcan tiger;
Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves
Shall never tremble. Or be alive again,
And dare me to the desert with thy sword.
If trembling I inhabit then, protest me
The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow,
Unreal mock’ry, hence!
