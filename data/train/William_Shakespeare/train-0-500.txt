Her silence flouts me, and Iâ€™ll be revenged. She flies after Bianca What, in my sight? Bianca, get thee in. Exit Bianca What, will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see
She is your treasure, she must have a husband.
I must dance barefoot on her wedding day,
And for your love to her lead apes in hell.
Talk not to me. I will go sit and weep
Till I can find occasion of revenge.
