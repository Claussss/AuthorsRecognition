Our flesh and blood is grown so vile, my lord,
That it doth hate what gets it. EDGAR Poor Tom’s a-cold. GLOUCESTER (to Lear) Go in with me. My duty cannot suffer
To obey in all your daughters’ hard commands.
Though their injunction be to bar my doors
And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you,
Yet have I ventured to come seek you out
And bring you where both food and fire is ready.
