Well, for this night we will repose us here;
Tomorrow toward London back again,
To look into this business thoroughly,
And call these foul offenders to their answers,
And poise the cause in justiceâ€™ equal scales,
Whose beam stands sure, whose rightful cause
prevails. Flourish. Exeunt 2.2
Enter the Duke of York and the Earls of Salisbury and Warwick
