If I break time, or flinch in property
Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die,
And well deserved. Not helping, deathâ€™s my fee.
But if I help, what do you promise me? Make thy demand. But will you make it even? Ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven. Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand
What husband in thy power I will command.
Exempted be from me the arrogance
To choose from forth the royal blood of France,
My low and humble name to propagate
With any branch or image of thy state;
But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know
Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.
