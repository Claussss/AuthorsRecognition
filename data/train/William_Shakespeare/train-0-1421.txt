TALBOT Ha, ha, ha! Laughest thou, wretch? Thy mirth shall turn to moan. I laugh to see your ladyship so fond
To think that you have aught but Talbot’s shadow
Whereon to practise your severity. COUNTESS Why? Art not thou the man? TALBOT I am indeed. COUNTESS Then have I substance too. No, no, I am but shadow of myself.
You are deceived; my substance is not here.
For what you see is but the smallest part
And least proportion of humanity.
I tell you, madam, were the whole frame here,
It is of such a spacious lofty pitch
Your roof were not sufficient to contain’t.
