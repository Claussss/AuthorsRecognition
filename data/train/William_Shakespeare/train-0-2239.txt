Rain added to a river that is rank
Perforce will force it overflow the bank. Still she entreats, and prettily entreats,
For to a pretty ear she tunes her tale.
Still is he sullen, still he lours and frets
â€™Twixt crimson shame and anger ashy-pale. Being red, she loves him best; and being white,
Her best is bettered with a more delight.
