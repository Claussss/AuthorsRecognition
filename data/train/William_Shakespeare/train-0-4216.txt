If I in act, consent, or sin of thought
Be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath
Which was embounded in this beauteous clay,
Let hell want pains enough to torture me.
I left him well. BASTARD Go bear him in thine arms. I am amazed, methinks, and lose my way
Among the thorns and dangers of this world.
