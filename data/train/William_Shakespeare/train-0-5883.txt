KING HARRY Yet they do wink and yield, as love is blind and enforces. BURGUNDY They are then excused, my lord, when they see not what they do. KING HARRY Then, good my lord, teach your cousin to consent winking. BURGUNDY I will wink on her to consent, my lord, if you will teach her to know my meaning. For maids, well summered and warm kept, are like flies at Bartholomew-tide: blind, though they have their eyes. And then they will endure handling, which before would not abide looking on.
