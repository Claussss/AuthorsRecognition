Your fatherâ€™s sickness is a maim to us. A perilous gash, a very limb lopped off. And yet, in faith, it is not. His present want
Seems more than we shall find it. Were it good
To set the exact wealth of all our states
All at one cast, to set so rich a main
On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?
It were not good, for therein should we read
The very bottom and the sole of hope,
The very list, the very utmost bound,
Of all our fortunes.
