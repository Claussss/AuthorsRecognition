GLOUCESTER Grace go with you, sir. Alarum and retreat. Enter Edgar Away, old man. Give me thy hand. Away.
King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter taâ€™en.
Give me thy hand. Come on. No farther, sir. A man may rot even here. What, in ill thoughts again? Men must endure

Ripeness is all. Come on. Exit Edgar guiding Gloucester
