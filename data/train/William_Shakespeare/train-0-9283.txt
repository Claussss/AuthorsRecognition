Enter Alexas ALEXAS Sovereign of Egypt, hail! How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
Yet, coming from him, that great medicine hath
With his tinct gilded thee. How goes it
With my brave Mark Antony? Last thing he did, dear Queen, He kissed—the last of many doubled kisses—
This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.
