SECOND MURDERER Look behind you, my lord! FIRST MURDERER (stabbing Clarence) Take that, and that! If all this will not serve,
I’ll drown you in the malmsey butt within. Exit with Clarence’s body SECOND MURDERER A bloody deed, and desperately dispatched!
How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands
Of this most grievous, guilty murder done.
