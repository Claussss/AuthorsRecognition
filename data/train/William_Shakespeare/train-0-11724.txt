I know your majesty has always loved her
So dear in heart not to deny her that
A woman of less place might ask by lawâ€”
Scholars allowed freely to argue for her. Ay, and the best she shall have, and my favour
To him that does best, God forbid else. Cardinal,
Prithee call Gardiner to me, my new secretary.
