Take her by the hand And tell her she is thine; to whom I promise
A counterpoise, if not to thy estate
A balance more replete. BERTRAM (rising) I take her hand. Good fortune and the favour of the King
Smile upon this contract, whose ceremony
Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief,
And be performed tonight. The solemn feast
Shall more attend upon the coming space,
Expecting absent friends. As thou lov’st her
Thy love’s to me religious; else, does err.
