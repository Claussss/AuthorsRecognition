ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Stop in your wind, sir. Tell me this, I pray:
Where have you left the money that I gave you? DROMIO OF EPHESUS O—sixpence that I had o’ Wednesday last
To pay the saddler for my mistress’ crupper?
The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not. ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE I am not in a sportive humour now.
Tell me, and dally not: where is the money?
We being strangers here, how dar’st thou trust
So great a charge from thine own custody?
