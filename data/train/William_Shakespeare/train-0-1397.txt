A short alarum. Enter English soldiers Hark, countrymen: either renew the fight
Or tear the lions out of England’s coat.
Renounce your style; give sheep in lions’ stead.
Sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf,
Or horse or oxen from the leopard,
As you fly from your oft-subdu Alarum. Here another skirmish
