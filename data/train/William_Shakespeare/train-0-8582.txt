Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance
From those that she calls servants, or from mine? Why not, my lord? If then they chanced to slack you,
We could control them. If you will come to me—
For now I spy a danger—I entreat you
To bring but five-and-twenty; to no more
Will I give place or notice.
