Enter Biondello O, master, master, I have watched so long
That I am dog-weary, but at last I spied
An ancient angel coming down the hill
Will serve the turn. TRANIO What is he, Biondello? Master, a marcantant or a pedant,
I know not what, but formal in apparel,
In gait and countenance surely like a father.
