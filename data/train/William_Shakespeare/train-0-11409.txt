We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards.
This wide-chopped rascal—would thou mightst lie
drowning
The washing of ten tides. He’ll be hanged yet, Though every drop of water swear against it
And gape at wid’st to glut him. A confused noise within MARINERS (within) Mercy on us! We split, we split! Farewell, my wife and children!
Farewell, brother! We split, we split, we spht!
