‘Courageous Roman, do not steep thy heart
In such relenting dew of lamentations,
But kneel with me, and help to bear thy part
To rouse our Roman gods with invocations
That they will suffer these abominations— Since Rome herself in them doth stand disgraced—
By our strong arms from forth her fair streets chased.
