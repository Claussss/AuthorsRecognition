BIRON Why, villain, thou must know first. COSTARD I will come to your worship tomorrow morning. It must be done this afternoon. Hark, slave,
It is but this:
The Princess comes to hunt here in the park,
And in her train there is a gentle lady.
When tongues speak sweetly, then they name her
name,
And Rosaline they call her. Ask for her,
And to her white hand see thou do commend
This sealed-up counsel. Thereâ€™s thy guerdon (giving
him a letter and money), go.
