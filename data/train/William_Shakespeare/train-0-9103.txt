LADY MACBETH You must leave this. O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!
Thou know’st that Banquo and his Fleance lives. LADY MACBETH But in them nature’s copy’s not eterne. There’s comfort yet, they are assailable.
Then be thou jocund. Ere the bat hath flown
His cloistered flight, ere to black Hecate’s summons
The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums
Hath rung night’s yawning peal, there shall be done
A deed of dreadful note.
