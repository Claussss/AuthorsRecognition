And everyone to rest himself betakes
Save thieves, and cares, and troubled minds that
wakes. As one of which doth Tarquin lie revolving
The sundry dangers of his willâ€™s obtaining,
Yet ever to obtain his will resolving,
Though weak-built hopes persuade him to abstaining.
Despair to gain doth traffic oft for gaining,
