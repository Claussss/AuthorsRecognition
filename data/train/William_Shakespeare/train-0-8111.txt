ESCALUS I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well. DUKE Peace be with you. Exit Escalus O place and greatness, millions of false eyes
Are stuck upon thee; volumes of report
Run with their false and most contrarious quest
Upon thy doings; thousand escapes of wit
Make thee the father of their idle dream,
And rack thee in their fancies.
