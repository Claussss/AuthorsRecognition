RICHARD GLOUCESTER What doth she say, my lord of Buckingham? Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord. QUEEN MARGARET What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel,
And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?

And say, ‘Poor Margaret was a prophetess’.—
Live each of you the subjects to his hate,
And he to yours, and all of you to God’s. Exit
