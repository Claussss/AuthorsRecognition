‘O time, cease thou thy course and last no longer,
If they surcease to be that should survive!
Shall rotten death make conquest of the stronger,
And leave the falt’ring feeble souls alive?
The old bees die, the young possess their hive. Then live, sweet Lucrece, live again and see
Thy father die, and not thy father thee.’
