As much for my poor brother as myself.
That is, were I under the terms of death,
Th’impression of keen whips I’d wear as rubies,
And strip myself to death as to a bed
That longing have been sick for, ere I’d yield
My body up to shame. ANGELO Then must your brother die. ISABELLA And ’twere the cheaper way.
