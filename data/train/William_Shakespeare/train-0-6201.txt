DUKE FREDERICK Can it be possible that no man saw them?
It cannot be. Some villains of my court
Are of consent and sufferance in this. I cannot hear of any that did see her.
The ladies her attendants of her chamber
Saw her abed, and in the morning early
They found the bed untreasured of their mistress.
