He’s said enough. He’s spoken like a traitor, and shall answer
As traitors do. Thou wretch, despite o’erwhelm thee! What should the people do with these bald tribunes,
On whom depending, their obedience fails
To th’ greater bench? In a rebellion,
When what’s not meet but what must be was law,
Then were they chosen. In a better hour
Let what is meet be said it must be meet,
And throw their power i’th’ dust.
