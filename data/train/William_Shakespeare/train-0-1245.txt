But, madam, where is Warwick then become? I am informed that he comes towards London
To set the crown once more on Henry’s head.
Guess thou the rest—King Edward’s friends must down.
But to prevent the tyrant’s violence—
For trust not him that hath once broken faith—
I’ll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary,
To save at least the heir of Edward’s right.
There shall I rest secure from force and fraud.
Come, therefore, let us fly while we may fly.
If Warwick take us, we are sure to die. Exeunt
