So, now dismiss your army when ye please.
Hang up your ensigns, let your drums be still;
For here we entertain a solemn peace. Exeunt 5.7
Enter the Earl of Suffolk, in conference with King Henry, and the Dukes of Gloucester and Exeter 
KING HENRY (to Suffolk) Your wondrous rare description, noble Earl,
Of beauteous Margaret hath astonished me.
Her virtues grac
Do breed loveâ€™s settled passions in my heart,
And like as rigour of tempestuous gusts
Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide,
So am I driven by breath of her renown
Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
Where I may have fruition of her love.
