How now, Marina, why do you keep alone?
How chance my daughter is not with you?
Do not consume your blood with sorrowing.
Have you a nurse of me. Lord, how your favour
Is changed with this unprofitable woe!
Give me your flowers. Come, o’er the sea margin
Walk with Leonine. The air is piercing there,
And quick; it sharps the stomach. Come, Leonine,
Take her by th’ arm. Walk with her.
