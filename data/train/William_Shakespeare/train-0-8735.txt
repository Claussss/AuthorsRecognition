ALBANY (to Edmund) Sir, you have showed today your valiant strain,
And fortune led you well. You have the captives
That were the opposites of this dayâ€™s strife.
We do require then of you, so to use them
As we shall find their merits and our safety
May equally determine. EDMUND Sir, I thought it fit To send the old and miserable King
To some retention and appointed guard,
Whose age has charms in it, whose title more,
To pluck the common bosom on his side
And turn our impressed lances in our eyes
Which do command them. With him I sent the Queen,
My reason all the same, and they are ready
Tomorrow, or at further space, to appear
Where you shall hold your session. At this time
We sweat and bleed. The friend hath lost his friend,
And the best quarrels in the heat are cursed
By those that feel their sharpness.
The question of Cordelia and her father
Requires a fitter place.
