That’s the least fear, for by the semblance
Of their white flags displayed they bring us peace,
And come to us as favourers, not foes. Thou speak‘st like him’s untutored to repeat;
Who makes the fairest show means most deceit.
But bring they what they will and what they can,
What need we fear?
Our grave’s the low’st, and we are half-way there.
Go tell their gen’ral we attend him here
To know for what he comes, and whence he comes.
