France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits
The tread of a man’s foot. To th’ wars! There’s letters from my mother. What th’import is
I know not yet. Ay, that would be known. To th’ wars, my boy, to th’
wars! 275
He wears his honour in a box unseen
That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,
Spending his manly marrow in her arms,
Which should sustain the bound and high curvet
Of Mars’s fiery steed. To other regions!
France is a stable, we that dwell in’t jades.
Therefore to th’ war.
