Sc. 16
Enter Sir Thomas More, the Lieutenant, and a Servant attending, as in his chamber in the Tower Master Lieutenant, is the warrant come?
If it be so, i’ God’s name let us know it. LIEUTENANT My lord, it is. ’Tis welcome, sir, to me with all my heart.
His bless Your wisdom, sir, hath been so well approved,
And your fair patience in imprisonment
Hath ever shown such constancy of mind
And Christian resolution in all troubles,
As warrants us you are not unprepared.
