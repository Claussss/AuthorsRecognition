There’s no trust, no faith, no honesty in men;
All perjured, all forsworn, all naught, dissemblers all.
Ah, where’s my man? Give me some aqua vitae.
These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
Shame come to Romeo! JULIET Blistered be thy tongue For such a wish! He was not born to shame.
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit,
For ’tis a throne where honour may be crowned
Sole monarch of the universal earth.
O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
