COUNTESS Well now. REYNALDO I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely. COUNTESS Faith, I do. Her father bequeathed her to me, and she herself without other advantage may lawfully make title to as much love as she finds. There is more owing her than is paid, and more shall be paid her than sheâ€™ll demand.
