Enter a Captain of Calais CAPTAIN OF CALAIS The burgesses of Calais, mighty king,
Have, by a council, willingly decreed
To yield the town and castle to your hands
Upon condition it will please your grace
To grant them benefit of life and goods. KING EDWARD They will so? Then, belike, they may command,
Dispose, elect and govern as they list!
No, sirrah. Tell them, since they did refuse
Our princely clemency at first proclaimed,
They shall not have it now, although they would.
I will accept of naught but fire and swordâ€”
Except within these two days, six of them,
That are the wealthiest merchants in the town,
Come naked all but for their linen shirts,
With each a halter hanged about his neck,
And, prostrate, yield themselves upon their knees
To be afflicted, hanged or what I please.
And so you may inform their masterships.
