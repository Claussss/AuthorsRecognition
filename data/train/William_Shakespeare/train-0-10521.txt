He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears
As he had seen‘t, or been an instrument
To vice you to’t, that you have touched his queen
Forbiddenly. O, then my best blood turn To an infected jelly, and my name
Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!
Turn then my freshest reputation to
A savour that may strike the dullest nostril
Where I arrive, and my approach be shunned,
Nay hated, too, worse than the great‘st infection
That e’er was heard or read.
