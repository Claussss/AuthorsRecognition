NORTHUMBERLAND Well hast thou spoken, cousin, be it so. Ah, know you not the city favours them,
And they have troops of soldiers at their beck? But when the Duke is slain, they’ll quickly fly. Far be the thought of this from Henry’s heart,
To make a shambles of the Parliament House.
Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words, and threats
Shall be the war that Henry means to use.
(To York) Thou factious Duke of York, descend my
throne
And kneel for grace and mercy at my feet.
I am thy sovereign.
