RICHARD GLOUCESTER Foul wrinkled witch, what mak’st thou in my sight? QUEEN MARGARET But repetition of what thou hast marred:
That will I make before I let thee go.
A husband and a son thou ow’st to me,
(To Elizabeth) And thou a kingdom; (to the rest) all of
you allegiance.
This sorrow that I have by right is yours,
And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.
