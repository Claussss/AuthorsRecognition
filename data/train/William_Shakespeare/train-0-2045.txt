Enter Richard Duke of Gloucester BISHOP OF ELY In happy time, here comes the Duke himself. RICHARD GLOUCESTER My noble lords, and cousins all, good morrow.
I have been long a sleeper, but I trust
My absence doth neglect no great design
Which by my presence might have been concluded. Had not you come upon your cue, my lord,
William Lord Hastings had pronounced your partâ€”
I mean, your voice, for crowning of the King.
