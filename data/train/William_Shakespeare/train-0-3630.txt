O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied? What satisfaction canst thou have tonight? Th’exchange of thy love’s faithful vow for mine. I gave thee mine before thou didst request it,
And yet I would it were to give again. Wouldst thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love? But to be frank and give it thee again.
And yet I wish but for the thing I have.
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
My love as deep. The more I give to thee
The more I have, for both are infinite.
