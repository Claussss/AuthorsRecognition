But did you never swear and break an oath? SECOND GAMEKEEPER No—never such an oath, nor will not now. Where did you dwell when I was King of England? SECOND GAMEKEEPER Here in this country, where we now remain. I was anointed king at nine months old,
My father and my grandfather were kings,
And you were sworn true subjects unto me—
And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths ?
