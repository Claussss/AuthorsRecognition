COUNTESS OF SALISBURY Pardon my boldness, my thrice-gracious lords.
Let my intrusion here be called my duty
That comes to see my sovereign how he fares. KING EDWARD (to Lodowick, giving him the paper) Go, draw the same, I tell thee in what form. LODOWICK I go. Exit COUNTESS OF SALISBURY Sorry I am to see my liege so sad.
What may thy subject do to drive from thee
Thy gloomy consort, sullen melancholy?
