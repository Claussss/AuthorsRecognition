Fie, lords!—that you, being supreme magistrates,
Thus contumeliously should break the peace. Peace, mayor, thou know’st little of my wrongs.
Here’s Beaufort—that regards nor God nor king-
Hath here distrained the Tower to his use. WINCHESTER (to Mayor) Here’s Gloucester—a foe to citizens,
One that still motions war, and never peace,
O’ercharging your free purses with large fines—
That seeks to overthrow religion,
Because he is Protector of the realm,
And would have armour here out of the Tower
To crown himself king and suppress the Prince.
