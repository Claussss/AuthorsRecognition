Faint-hearted Woodville! Prizest him fore me?—
Arrogant Winchester, that haughty prelate,
Whom Henry, our late sovereign, ne’er could brook?
Thou art no friend to God or to the King.
Open the gates, or I’ll shut thee out shortly. Open the gates unto the Lord Protector,
Or we’ll burst them open, if that you come not quickly.
