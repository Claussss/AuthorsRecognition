LOUIS THE DAUPHIN Strong reasons make strange actions. Let us go.
If you say ay, the King will not say no. Exeunt 4.1
Enter Hubert, and Executioners with a rope and irons Heat me these irons hot, and look thou stand
Within the arras. When I strike my foot
Upon the bosom of the ground, rush forth
And bind the boy which you shall find with me
Fast to the chair. Be heedful. Hence, and watch! 5
