(Drinking) Health to my lord and gentle cousin Mowbray! You wish me health in very happy season,
For I am on the sudden something ill. ARCHBISHOP OF YORK Against ill chances men are ever merry;
But heaviness foreruns the good event. WESTMORLAND Therefore be merry, coz, since sudden sorrow
Serves to say thus: some good thing comes tomorrow.
