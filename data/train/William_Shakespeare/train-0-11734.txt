My good lord, Not your demand; it values not your asking.
Our mistress’ sorrows we were pitying. LORD CHAMBERLAIN It was a gentle business, and becoming
The action of good women. There is hope
All will be well. Now I pray God, amen. LORD CHAMBERLAIN You bear a gentle mind, and heav’nly blessings
Follow such creatures. That you may, fair lady,
Perceive I speak sincerely, and high note’s
Ta’en of your many virtues, the King’s majesty
Commends his good opinion of you, and
Does purpose honour to you no less flowing
Than Marchioness of Pembroke; to which title
A thousand pound a year annual support
Out of his grace he adds.
