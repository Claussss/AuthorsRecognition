KING RICHARD Why, our battalia trebles that account.
Besides, the King’s name is a tower of strength,
Which they upon the adverse faction want.
Up with the tent! Come, noble gentlemen,
Let us survey the vantage of the ground.
Call for some men of sound direction.
Let’s lack no discipline, make no delay—
For, lords, tomorrow is a busy day.
