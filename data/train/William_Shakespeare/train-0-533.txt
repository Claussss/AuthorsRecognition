Nay, I have offered all. I have no more,
And she can have no more than all I have.
If you like me, she shall have me and mine. Why then, the maid is mine from all the world.
By your firm promise Gremio is out-vied. I must confess your offer is the best,
And let your father make her the assurance,
She is your own. Else, you must pardon me,
If you should die before him, whereâ€™s her dower?
