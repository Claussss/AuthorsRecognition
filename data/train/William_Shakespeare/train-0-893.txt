Beaufort, it is thy sovereign speaks to thee. CARDINAL BEAUFORT Bring me unto my trial when you will.
Died he not in his bed ? Where should he die?
Can I make men live whe’er they will or no?
O, torture me no more—I will confess.
Alive again? Then show me where he is.
I’ll give a thousand pound to look upon him.
He hath no eyes! The dust hath blinded them.
Comb down his hair—look, look: it stands upright,
Like lime twigs set to catch my winged soul.
Give me some drink, and bid the apothecary
Bring the strong poison that I bought of him.
