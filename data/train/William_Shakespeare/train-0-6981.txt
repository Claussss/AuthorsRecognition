And I most jocund, apt, and willingly
To do you rest a thousand deaths would die. Where goes Cesario? After him I love
More than I love these eyes, more than my life,
More by all mores than eâ€™er I shall love wife.
If I do feign, you witnesses above,
Punish my life for tainting of my love. Ay me detested, how am I beguiled!
