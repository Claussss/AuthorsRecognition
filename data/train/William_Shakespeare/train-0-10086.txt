HELICANUS Sit, sir. I will recount it. Enter Lord with Marina and another maid But see, I am prevented. O, here’s the lady that I sent for.— Welcome, fair one.—Is’t not a goodly presence? HELICANUS She’s a gallant lady. She’s such a one that, were I well assured
Came of gentle kind or noble stock, I’d wish
No better choice to think me rarely wed.—
Fair one, all goodness that consists in bounty
Expect e’en here, where is a kingly patient;
If that thy prosperous and artificial feat
Can draw him but to answer thee in aught,
Thy sacred physic shall receive such pay
As thy desires can wish.
