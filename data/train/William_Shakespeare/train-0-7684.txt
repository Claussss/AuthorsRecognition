’Twill do well, my lord, And be right pleasing pastime to your guests. I prithee tell me, what plays have ye? Diverse, my lord: The Cradle of Security,
Hit Nail o’th’ Head, Impatient Poverty,
The Play of Four Ps, Dives and Lazarus,
Lusty Juventus, and The Marriage of Wit and Wisdom. The Marriage of Wit and Wisdom? That, my lads,
I’ll none but that. The theme is very good,
And may maintain a liberal argument.
To marry wit to wisdom asks some cunning.
Many have wit that may come short of wisdom.
We’ll see how Master Poet plays his part,
And whether wit or wisdom grace his art.
Go, make him drink, and all his fellows too.
How many are ye?
