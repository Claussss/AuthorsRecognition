SIR JOHN Tut, never fear me. I am as vigilant as a cat to steal cream. PRINCE HARRY I think to steal cream indeed, for thy theft hath already made thee butter. But tell me, Jack, whose fellows are these that come after? SIR JOHN Mine, Hal, mine. PRINCE HARRY I did never see such pitiful rascals. SIR JOHN Tut, tut, good enough to toss, food for powder, food for powder. Theyâ€™ll fill a pit as well as better. Tush, man, mortal men, mortal men.
