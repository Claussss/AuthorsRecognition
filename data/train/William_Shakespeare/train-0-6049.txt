LEPIDUS What, shall I find you here? OCTAVIUS Or here or at the Capitol. Exit Lepidus This is a slight, unmeritable man,
Meet to be sent on errands. Is it fit,
The three-fold world divided, he should stand
One of the three to share it? OCTAVIUS So you thought him, And took his voice who should be pricked to die
In our black sentence and proscription.
