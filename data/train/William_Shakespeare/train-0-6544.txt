Hautboys play. The dumb show enters. Enter a King
and a Queen very lovingly, the Queen embracing him.
She kneels and makes show of protestation unto him.
He takes her up and declines his head upon her neck.
He lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing
him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes
off his crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the Kingâ€™s
ears, and exits. The Queen returns, finds
the King dead, and makes passionate action. The
poisoner, with some two or three mutes, comes in
again, seeming to lament with her. The dead body is
carried away. The poisoner woos the Queen with
gifts. She seems loath and unwilling a while, but in
the end accepts his love. Exeunt the Players
