KATHERINE (waking) Spirits of peace, where are ye? Are ye all gone,
And leave me here in wretchedness behind ye? Griffith and Patience rise and come forward Madam, we are here. KATHERINE It is not you I call for. Saw ye none enter since I slept? None, madam. No? Saw you not even now a bless
Invite me to a banquet, whose bright faces
Cast thousand beams upon me, like the sun?
They promised me eternal happiness,
And brought me garlands, Griffith, which I feel
I am not worthy yet to wear. I shall,
Assuredly.
