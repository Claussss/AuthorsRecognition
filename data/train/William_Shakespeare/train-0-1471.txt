Enter Joan la Pucelle on the top, thrusting out a torch burning Behold, this is the happy wedding torch
That joineth Rouen unto her countrymen,
But burning fatal to the Talbonites. See, noble Charles, the beacon of our friend.
The burning torch in yonder turret stands. Now shine it like a comet of revenge,
A prophet to the fall of all our foes!
