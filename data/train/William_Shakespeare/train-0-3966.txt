He drops the juice on Titania’s eyelids Be as thou wast wont to be,
See as thou wast wont to see.
Dian’s bud o’er Cupid’s flower
Hath such force and blessed power.  Now, my Titania, wake you, my sweet queen. TITANIA (awaking) My Oberon, what visions have I seen!
Methought I was enamoured of an ass. There lies your love.
