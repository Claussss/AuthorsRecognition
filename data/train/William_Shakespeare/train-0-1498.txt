Talbot rises
and for these good deserts We here create you Earl of Shrewsbury;
And in our coronation take your place. Sennet. Exeunt all but Vernon and Basset Now sir, to you that were so hot at sea,
Disgracing of these colours that I wear
In honour of my noble lord of York,
Dar’st thou maintain the former words thou spak’st?
