MARINA No, I pray you, I’ll not bereave you of your servant. DIONYZA Come, come, I love the King your father and yourself
With more than foreign heart. We ev’ry day
Expect him here. When he shall come and find
Our paragon to all reports thus blasted,
He will repent the breadth of his great voyage,
Blame both my lord and me, that we have taken
No care to your best courses. Go, I pray you,
Walk and be cheerful once again; resume
That excellent complexion which did steal
The eyes of young and old. Care not for me.
I can go home alone.
