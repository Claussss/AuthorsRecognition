4.3
Enter the two Captains Dumaine and some two or three soldiers 
FIRST LORD DUMAINE You have not given him his mother’s letter? SECOND LORD DUMAINE I have delivered it an hour since. There is something in’t that stings his nature, for on the reading it he changed almost into another man. FIRST LORD DUMAINE He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off so good a wife and so sweet a lady.
