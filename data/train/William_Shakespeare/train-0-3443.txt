Madam, I’ll sing. ’Tis well that thou hast cause; But thou shouldst please me better wouldst thou weep. I could weep, madam, would it do you good. And I could sing, would weeping do me good,
And never borrow any tear of thee. Enter a Gardener and two Men But stay; here come the gardeners.
Let’s step into the shadow of these trees.
My wretchedness unto a row of pins
They will talk of state, for everyone doth so
Against a change. Woe is forerun with woe.
