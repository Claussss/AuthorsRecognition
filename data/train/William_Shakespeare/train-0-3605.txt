It fits when such a villain is a guest.
I’ll not endure him. CAPULET He shall be endured. What, goodman boy, I say he shall. Go to,
Am I the master here or you ? Go to—
You’ll not endure him! God shall mend my soul.
You’ll make a mutiny among my guests,
You will set cock-a-hoop! You’ll be the man! Why, uncle, ’tis a shame.
