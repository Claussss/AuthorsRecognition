My staff? Here, noble Henry, is my staff.
As willingly do I the same resign
As erst thy father Henry made it mine;
And even as willing at thy feet I leave it
As others would ambitiously receive it. He lays the staff at King Henryâ€™s feet Farewell, good King. When I am dead and gone,
May honourable peace attend thy throne. Exit
