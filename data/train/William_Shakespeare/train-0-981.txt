Exeunt with the body 
5.1
Enter the Duke of York and his army of Irish with a drummer and soldiers bearing colours From Ireland thus comes York to claim his right,
And pluck the crown from feeble Henry’s head.
Ring, bells, aloud; burn, bonfires, clear and bright,
To entertain great England’s lawful king.
Ah, sancta maiestas! Who would not buy thee dear?
Let them obey that knows not how to rule;
This hand was made to handle naught but gold.
I cannot give due action to my words,
Except a sword or sceptre balance it.
A sceptre shall it have, have I as word,
On which I’ll toss the fleur-de-lis of France.
Enter the Duke of Buckingham
(Aside) Whom have we here? Buckingham to disturb
me?
The King hath sent him sure—I must dissemble.
