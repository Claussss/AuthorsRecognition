These blue-veined violets whereon we lean
Never can blab, nor know not what we mean. â€˜The tender spring upon thy tempting lip
Shows thee unripe; yet mayst thou well be tasted.
Make use of time; let not advantage slip.
Beauty within itself should not be wasted. Fair flowers that are not gathered in their prime
Rot, and consume themselves in little time.
