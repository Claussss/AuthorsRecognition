Emilia helps Desdemona to undress I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed. All’s one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!
If I do die before thee, prithee shroud me
In one of these same sheets. EMILIA Come, come, you talk. My mother had a maid called Barbary.
She was in love, and he she loved proved mad
And did forsake her. She had a song of willow.
An old thing ’twas, but it expressed her fortune,
And she died singing it. That song tonight
Will not go from my mind. I have much to do
But to go hang my head all at one side
And sing it, like poor Barbary. Prithee, dispatch.
