It pleaseth you, my father, to express
My commendations great, whose merit’s less. KING SIMONIDES It’s fit it should be so, for princes are
A model which heav’n makes like to itself.
As jewels lose their glory if neglected,
So princes their renown, if not respected.
’Tis now your office, daughter, to entertain
The labour of each knight in his device.
