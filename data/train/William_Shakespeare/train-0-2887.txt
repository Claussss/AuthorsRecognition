ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS O, Signor Balthasar, either at flesh or fish
A table full of welcome makes scarce one dainty dish. Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords. ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS And welcome more common, for thatâ€™s nothing but words. Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.
