Gracious my lord, You know your father’s temper. At this time
He will allow no speech—which I do guess
You do not purpose to him; and as hardly
Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear.
Then till the fury of his highness settle,
Come not before him. I not purpose it. I think, Camillo? Even he, my lord.
