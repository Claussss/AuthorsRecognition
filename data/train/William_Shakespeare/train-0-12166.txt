Emilia,
 To buy you I have lost what’s dearest to me
Save what is bought, and yet I purchase cheaply
As I do rate your value. THESEUS (to Emilia) O lov
 He speaks now of as brave a knight as e’er
Did spur a noble steed. Surely the gods
Would have him die a bachelor lest his race
Should show i’th’ world too godlike. His behaviour
So charmed me that, methought, Alcides was
To him a sow of lead. If I could praise
Each part of him to th‘all I have spoke, your Arcite
Did not lose by’t; for he that was thus good,
Encountered yet his better. I have heard
Two emulous Philomels beat the ear o’th’ night
With their contentious throats, now one the higher,
Anon the other, then again the first,
And by and by out-breasted, that the sense
Could not be judge between ’em—so it fared
Good space between these kinsmen, till heavens did
Make hardly one the winner. (To Arcite) Wear the
garland
With joy that you have won.—For the subdued,
Give them our present justice, since I know
Their lives but pinch ’em. Let it here be done.
The scene’s not for our seeing; go we hence
Right joyful, with some sorrow. (To Arcite) Arm your
prize;
I know you will not lose her. Hippolyta,
I see one eye of yours conceives a tear,
The which it will deliver.
