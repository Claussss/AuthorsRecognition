So do I, my lord. They are entirely welcome. I thank your honour. For my part, my lord,
My purpose was not to have seen you here,
But meeting with Salerio by the way
He did entreat me past all saying nay
To come with him along. SALERIO I did, my lord, And I have reason for it. Signor Antonio
Commends him to you.
