RICHARD GLOUCESTER I hope the King made peace with all of us,
And the compact is firm and true in me. And so in me, and so I think in all.
Yet since it is but green, it should be put
To no apparent likelihood of breach,
Which haply by much company might be urged.
Therefore I say, with noble Buckingham,
That it is meet so few should fetch the Prince.
