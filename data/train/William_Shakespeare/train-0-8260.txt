IAGO My lord, you know I love you. OTHELLO I think thou dost, And for I know thou‘rt full of love and honesty,
And weigh’st thy words before thou giv’st them
breath,
Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more;
For such things in a false disloyal knave
Are tricks of custom, but in a man that’s just,
They’re close dilations, working from the heart
That passion cannot rule.
