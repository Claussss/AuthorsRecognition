Go, one of you, find out the forester,
For now our observation is performed;
And since we have the vanguard of the day,
My love shall hear the music of my hounds.
Uncouple in the western valley; let them go.
Dispatch, I say, and find the forester. Exit one
We will, fair Queen, up to the mountainâ€™s top,
And mark the musical confusion
Of hounds and echo in conjunction.
