Ye’re like one that superstitiously
Do swear to th’ gods that winter kills the flies,
But yet I know you’ll do as I advise. Exeunt Sc. 18
Enter Gower Thus time we waste, and long leagues make we short,
Sail seas in cockles, have and wish but for‘t,
Making to take imagination
From bourn to bourn, region to region.
By you being pardoned, we commit no crime
To use one language in each sev’ral clime
Where our scene seems to live. I do beseech you
To learn of me, who stand i’th’ gaps to teach you
The stages of our story: Pericles
Is now again thwarting the wayward seas,
Attended on by many a lord and knight,
To see his daughter, all his life’s delight.
Old Helicanus goes along. Behind
Is left to govern, if you bear in mind,
Old Aeschines, whom Helicanus late
Advanced in Tyre to great and high estate.
Well sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought
This king to Tarsus—think his pilot thought;
So with his steerage shall your thoughts go on—
To fetch his daughter home, who first is gone.
Like motes and shadows see them move a while;
Your ears unto your eyes I’ll reconcile.
