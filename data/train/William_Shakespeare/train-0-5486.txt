LEONATO My lord, will you walk? Dinner is ready. CLAUDIO (aside) If he do not dote on her upon this, I will never trust my expectation. DON PEDRO (aside) Let there be the same net spread for her, and that must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry. The sport will be when they hold one an opinion of another’s dotage, and no such matter. That’s the scene that I would see, which will be merely a dumb show. Let us send her to call him in to dinner. Exeunt Don Pedro, Claudio, and Leonato
