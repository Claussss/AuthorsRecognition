Be silent; letâ€™s see further. PISANIO (aside) It is my mistress. Since she is living, let the time run on
To good or bad. CYMBELINE (to Innogen) Come, stand thou by our side, Make thy demand aloud. (To Giacomo) Sir, step you
forth.
Give answer to this boy, and do it freely,
Or, by our greatness and the grace of it,
Which is our honour, bitter torture shall
Winnow the truth from falsehood.
(To Innogen)
