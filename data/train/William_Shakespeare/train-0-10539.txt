Hold your peaces. Good my lord— ANTIGONUS (to Leontes) It is for you we speak, not for ourselves.
You are abused, and by some putter-on
That will be damned for’t. Would I knew the villain—
I would land-damn him. Be she honour-flawed—
I have three daughters: the eldest is eleven;
The second and the third nine and some five;
If this prove true, they’ll pay for’t. By mine honour,
I’ll geld ’em all. Fourteen they shall not see,
To bring false generations. They are co-heirs,
And I had rather glib myself than they
Should not produce fair issue.
