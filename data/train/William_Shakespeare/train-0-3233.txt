Teach us, sweet madam, for our rude transgression
Some fair excuse. The fairest is confession. Were not you here but even now disguised? Madam, I was. And were you well advised? I was, fair madam. When you then were here, What did you whisper in your ladyâ€™s ear? That more than all the world I did respect her.
