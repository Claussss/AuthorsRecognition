RICHARD PLANTAGENET Hath not thy rose a canker, Somerset? Hath not thy rose a thorn, Plantagenet? RICHARD PLANTAGENET Ay, sharp and piercing, to maintain his truth,
Whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood. Well, Iâ€™ll find friends to wear my bleeding roses,
That shall maintain what I have said is true,
Where false Plantagenet dare not be seen.
