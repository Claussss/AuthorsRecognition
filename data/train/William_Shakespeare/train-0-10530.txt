Enter apart Leontes, Antigonus, and Lords Was he met there? His train? Camillo with him? Behind the tuft of pines I met them. Never
Saw I men scour so on their way. I eyed them
Even to their ships. How blest am I In my just censure, in my true opinion!
Alack, for lesser knowledge—how accursed
In being so blest! There may be in the cup
A spider steeped, and one may drink, depart,
And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge
Is not infected; but if one present
Th’abhorred ingredient to his eye, make known
How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,
With violent hefts. I have drunk, and seen the spider.
Camillo was his help in this, his pander.
There is a plot against my life, my crown.
All’s true that is mistrusted. That false villain
Whom I employed was pre-employed by him.
He has discovered my design, and I
Remain a pinched thing, yea, a very trick
For them to play at will. How came the posterns
So easily open?
