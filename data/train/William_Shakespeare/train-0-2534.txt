And dying eyes gleamed forth their ashy lights
Like dying coals burnt out in tedious nights. There might you see the labouring pioneer
Begrimed with sweat and smeared all with dust,
And from the towers of Troy there would appear
The very eyes of men through loop-holes thrust,
Gazing upon the Greeks with little lust.
