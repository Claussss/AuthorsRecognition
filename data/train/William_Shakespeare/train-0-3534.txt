KING HENRY Carlisle, this is your doom. Choose out some secret place, some reverent room
More than thou hast, and with it joy thy life.
So as thou livâ€™st in peace, die free from strife.
For though mine enemy thou hast ever been,
High sparks of honour in thee have I seen. Enter Exton with  Great King, within this coffin I present
Thy buried fear. Herein all breathless lies
The mightiest of thy greatest enemies,
Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.
