I have, Antiochus, and with a soul
Emboldened with the glory of her praise
Think death no hazard in this enterprise.
ANTIOCHUS Music! Music sounds Bring in our daughter, cloth
Fit for th’embracements ev’n of Jove himself,
At whose conception, till Lucina reigned,

The senate-house of planets all did sit,
In her their best perfections to knit.
