RICHARD DUKE OF YORK Let this dissension first be tried by fight,
And then your highness shall command a peace. The quarrel toucheth none but us alone;
Betwixt ourselves let us decide it then. RICHARD DUKE OF YORK There is my pledge. Accept it, Somerset. VERNON (to King Henry) Nay, let it rest where it began at first.
