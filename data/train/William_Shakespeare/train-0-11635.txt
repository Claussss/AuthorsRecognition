After the hideous storm that followed, was
A thing inspired, and, not consulting, broke
Into a general prophecy—that this tempest,
Dashing the garment of this peace, aboded
The sudden breach on’t. Which is budded out— For France hath flawed the league, and hath attached
Our merchants’ goods at Bordeaux.
