Enter Goneril and Oswald, her steward GONERIL Did my father strike my gentleman
For chiding of his fool? OSWALD Ay, madam. By day and night he wrongs me. Every hour
He flashes into one gross crime or other
That sets us all at odds. I’ll not endure it.
His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us
On every trifle. When he returns from hunting
I will not speak with him. Say I am sick.
If you come slack of former services
You shall do well; the fault of it I’ll answer.
