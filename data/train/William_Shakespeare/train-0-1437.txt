Go forward, and be choked with thy ambition.
And so farewell until I meet thee next. Exit Have with thee, Pole.â€”Farewell, ambitious Richard. RICHARD PLANTAGENET How I am braved, and must perforce endure it! This blot that they object against your house
Shall be wiped out in the next parliament,
Called for the truce of Winchester and Gloucester.
An if thou be not then created York,
I will not live to be accounted Warwick.
Meantime, in signal of my love to thee.
Against proud Somerset and William Pole,
Will I upon thy party wear this rose.
And here I prophesy: this brawl today,
Grown to this faction in the Temple garden,
Shall send, between the red rose and the white,
A thousand souls to death and deadly night.
