I’ll put a girdle round about the earth
In forty minutes. Exit OBERON Having once this juice I’ll watch Titania when she is asleep,
And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.
The next thing then she waking looks upon—
Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,
On meddling monkey, or on busy ape—
She shall pursue it with the soul of love.
And ere I take this charm from off her sight—
As I can take it with another herb—
I’ll make her render up her page to me.
But who comes here? I am invisible,
And I will overhear their conference.
