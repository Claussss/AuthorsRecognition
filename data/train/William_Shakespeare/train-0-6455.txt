Propose the oath, my lord. Never to speak of this that you have seen,
Swear by my sword. GHOST (under the stage) Swear. Hic et ubique? Then we’ll shift our ground.—
Come hither, gentlemen,
And lay your hands again upon my sword.
Never to speak of this that you have heard,
Swear by my sword. GHOST (under the stage) Swear.
