JULIET I’ll gladly learn. DUKE Love you the man that wronged you? Yes, as I love the woman that wronged him. So then it seems your most offenceful act
Was mutually committed? Then was your sin of heavier kind than his. I do confess it and repent it, father. ’Tis meet so, daughter. But lest you do repent

Which sorrow is always toward ourselves, not heaven,
Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,
But as we stand in fear—
