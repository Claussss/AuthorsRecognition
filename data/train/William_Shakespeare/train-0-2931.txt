ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS I answer you? What should I answer you? The money that you owe me for the chain. ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS I owe you none till I receive the chain. You know I gave it you half an hour since. ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS You gave me none. You wrong me much to say so. You wrong me more, sir, in denying it.
Consider how it stands upon my credit.
