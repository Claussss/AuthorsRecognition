Enter abovethe Ghost of the Duke of Buckingham GHOST OF BUCKINGHAM (to Richard) The first was I that helped thee to the crown;
The last was I that felt thy tyranny.
O in the battle think on Buckingham,
And die in terror of thy guiltiness!
Dream on, dream on, of bloody deeds and death;
Fainting, despair; despairing, yield thy breath.
(To Richmond) I died for hope ere I could lend thee aid.
But cheer thy heart, and be thou not dismayed.
God and good angels fight on Richmondâ€™s side,
And Richard falls in height of all his pride. Exit
