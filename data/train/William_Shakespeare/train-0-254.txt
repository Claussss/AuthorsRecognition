Please you, I’ll write your ladyship another. And when it’s writ, for my sake read it over,
And if it please you, so. If not, why, so. If it please me, madam? What then? Why, if it please you, take it for your labour.
And so good morrow, servant. SPEED (aside) O jest unseen, inscrutable, invisible
As a nose on a man’s face or a weathercock on a
steeple.
My master sues to her, and she hath taught her suitor,
He being her pupil, to become her tutor.
O excellent device! Was there ever heard a better?—
That my master, being scribe, to himself should write
the letter.
