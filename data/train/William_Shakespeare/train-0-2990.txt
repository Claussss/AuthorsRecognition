Be quiet and depart. Thou shalt not have him. Exit into the priory LUCIANA (to Adriana) Complain unto the Duke of this indignity. Come, go, I will fall prostrate at his feet,
And never rise until my tears and prayers
Have won his grace to come in person hither
And take perforce my husband from the Abbess.
