But, Warwick, thou and Oxford, with five thousand
men,
Shall cross the seas and bid false Edward battle;
And, as occasion serves, this noble Queen
And Prince shall follow with a fresh supply.
Yet, ere thou go, but answer me one doubt:
What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty? This shall assure my constant loyalty :
That if our Queen and this young Prince agree,
Iâ€™ll join mine eldest daughter and my joy
To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands.
