PRINCE EDWARD God keep me from false friends; but they were none. Enter Lord Mayor  RICHARD GLOUCESTER My lord, the Mayor of London comes to greet you. MAYOR (kneeling to Prince Edward) God bless your grace with health and happy days. PRINCE EDWARD I thank you, good my lord, and thank you all.â€”

Would long ere this have met us on the way.
Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he hastes not
To tell us whether they will come or no.
