With marriage wherefore was he mocked,
To be exiled, and thrown
From Leonati seat and cast
From her his dearest one,
Sweet Innogen? Why did you suffer Giacomo,
Slight thing of Italy,
To taint his nobler heart and brain
With needless jealousy,
And to become the geck and scorn
O’th’ other’s villainy? SECOND BROTHER
