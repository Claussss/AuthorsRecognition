Ah, Warwick, Warwick—wert thou as we are,
We might recover all our loss again.
The Queen from France hath brought a puissant
power.
Even now we heard the news. Ah, couldst thou fly! Why, then I would not fly. Ah, Montague,
If thou be there, sweet brother, take my hand,
And with thy lips keep in my soul a while.
Thou lov’st me not—for, brother, if thou didst,
Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood
That glues my lips and will not let me speak.
Come quickly, Montague, or I am dead.
