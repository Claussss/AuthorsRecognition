Knocks at my heart, and whispers in mine ear
That if I love thee, I thy death should fear; â€˜And, more than so, presenteth to mine eye
The picture of an angry chafing boar,
Under whose sharp fangs on his back doth lie
An image like thyself, all stained with gore, Whose blood upon the fresh flowers being shed
Doth make them droop with grief, and hang the
head.
