Too modest are you, More cruel to your good report than grateful
To us that give you truly. By your patience,
If ‘gainst yourself you be incensed we’ll put you,
Like one that means his proper harm, in manacles,
Then reason safely with you. Therefore be it known,
As to us, to all the world, that Caius Martius
Wears this war’s garland, in token of the which
My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,
With all his trim belonging; and from this time,
For what he did before Corioles, call him,
With all th’applause and clamour of the host,
Martius Caius Coriolanus. Bear th’addition
Nobly ever!
