FURTHER READING A SELECT GLOSSARY INDEX OF FIRST LINES OF SONNETS Martin Droeshoutâ€™s engraving of Shakespeare, first published on the title-page of the First Folio (1623) 
To the Reader This figure that thou here seest put,
 It was for gentle Shakespeare cut,
 Wherein the graver had a strife
 With nature to outdo the life.
 O, could he but have drawn his wit
 As well in brass as he hath hit
 His face, the print would then surpass
 All that was ever writ in brass!
 But since he cannot, reader, look
 Not on his picture, but his book.
