And she goes down at twelve. I take’t ’tis later, sir. BANQUO (giving Fleance his sword)
Hold, take my sword. There’s husbandry in heaven,
Their candles are all out. Take thee that, too.
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,
And yet I would not sleep. Merciful powers,
Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature
Gives way to in repose.
Enter Macbeth, and a servant with a torch
Give me my sword. Who’s there?
