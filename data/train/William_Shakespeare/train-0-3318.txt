The trumpets sound. Enter Bolingbroke Duke of Hereford, appellant, in armour, and a Herald KING RICHARD Marshal, ask yonder knight in arms
Both who he is and why he cometh hither
Thus plated in habiliments of war;
And formally, according to our law,
Depose him in the justice of his cause. LORD MARSHAL (to Bolingbroke)
