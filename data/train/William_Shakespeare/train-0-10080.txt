Lysimachus) This is the man that can in aught resolve you. LYSIMACHUS (to Helicanus) Hail, reverend sir; the gods preserve you! And you, sir, to outlive the age I am,
And die as I would do. LYSIMACHUS You wish me well. I am the governor of Mytilene;
Being on shore, honouring of Neptuneâ€™s triumphs,
Seeing this goodly vessel ride before us,
I made to it to know of whence you are.
