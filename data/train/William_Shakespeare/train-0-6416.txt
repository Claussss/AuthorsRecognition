Ay, madam, it is common. QUEEN GERTRUDE Why seems it so particular with thee? Seems, madam? Nay, it is. I know not ‘seems’.
‘Tis not alone my inky cloak, good-mother,
Nor customary suits of solemn black,
Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
Nor the dejected haviour of the visage,
Together with all forms, moods, shows of grief
That can denote me truly. These indeed ‘seem’,
For they are actions that a man might play;
But I have that within which passeth show—
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
