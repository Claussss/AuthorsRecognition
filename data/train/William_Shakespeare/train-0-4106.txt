LOUIS THE DAUPHIN She is sad and passionate at your highness’ tent. 545 KING PHILIP And by my faith this league that we have made
Will give her sadness very little cure.—
Brother of England, how may we content
This widow lady? In her right we came,
Which we, God knows, have turned another way 550
To our own vantage.
