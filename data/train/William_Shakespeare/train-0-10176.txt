Alarum. The Romans are beat back and exeuntto their trenches, the Volsces following 
1.5
Enter Roman Soldiers, in retreat, followed byMartius, cursing All the contagion of the south light on you,
You shames of Rome! You herd of—boils and plagues
Plaster you o’er, that you may be abhorred
Farther than seen, and one infect another
Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese
That bear the shapes of men, how have you run
From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell:
All hurt behind! Backs red, and faces pale
With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,
Or by the fires of heaven I’ll leave the foe
And make my wars on you. Look to’t. Come on.
If you’ll stand fast, we’ll beat them to their wives,
As they us to our trenches. Follow.
