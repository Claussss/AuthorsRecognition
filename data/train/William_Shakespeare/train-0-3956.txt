He lies down  Come, thou gentle day;
For if but once thou show me thy grey light,
I’ll find Demetrius, and revenge this spite. He sleeps Enter Robin Goodfellow and Demetrius ROBIN shifting place Ho, ho, ho, coward, why com’st thou not? Abide me if thou dar‘st, for well I wot
Thou runn’st before me, shifting every place,
And dar’st not stand nor look me in the face.
Where art thou now?
