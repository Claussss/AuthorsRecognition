Give me a living reason she’s disloyal. IAGO I do not like the office, But sith I am entered in this cause so far,
Pricked to’t by foolish honesty and love,
I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately,
And being troubled with a raging tooth,
I could not sleep. There are a kind of men
So loose of soul that in their sleeps
Will mutter their affairs. One of this kind is Cassio.
In sleep I heard him say ‘Sweet Desdemona,
Let us be wary, let us hide our loves’,
And then, sir, would he grip and wring my hand,
Cry ‘O, sweet creature!’, then kiss me hard,
As if he plucked up kisses by the roots,
That grew upon my lips, lay his leg o‘er my thigh,
And sigh, and kiss, and then cry 
That gave thee to the Moor!’
