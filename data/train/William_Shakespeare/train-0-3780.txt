Alack the day, she’s dead, she’s dead, she’s dead! Ha, let me see her! Out, alas, she’s cold.
Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff.
Life and these lips have long been separated.
Death lies on her like an untimely frost
Upon the sweetest flower of all the field. O lamentable day! CAPULET’S WIFE O woeful time!
