Go, bind his man, for he is frantic too. They bind Dromio What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer?
Hast thou delight to see a wretched man
Do outrage and displeasure to himself? He is my prisoner. If I let him go,
The debt he owes will be required of me. I will discharge thee ere I go from thee.
Bear me forthwith unto his creditor,
And, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.â€”
Good Master Doctor, see him safe conveyed
Home to my house. O most unhappy day!
