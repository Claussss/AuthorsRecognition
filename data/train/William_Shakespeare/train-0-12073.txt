O heaven,
 What more than man is this! I have sworn. We seek not
 Thy breath of mercy, Theseus. ‘Tis to me
A thing as soon to die as thee to say it,
And no more moved. Where this man calls me traitor
Let me say thus much—if in love be treason,
In service of so excellent a beauty,
As I love most, and in that faith will perish,
As I have brought my life here to confirm it,
As I have served her truest, worthiest,
As I dare kill this cousin that denies it,
So let me be most traitor and ye please me.
For scorning thy edict, Duke, ask that lady
Why she is fair, and why her eyes command me
Stay here to love her, and if she say, ‘Traitor’,
I am a villain fit to lie unburied.
