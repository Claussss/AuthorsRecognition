DROMIO OF EPHESUS No, none by me. ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE (to
Adriana) This purse of ducats I received from you,
And Dromio my man did bring them me.
I see we still did meet each other’s man,
And I was ta’en for him, and he for me,
And thereupon these errors are arose. ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS These ducats pawn I for my father here.
