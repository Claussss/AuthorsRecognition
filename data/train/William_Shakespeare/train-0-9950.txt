KING SIMONIDES He’s but a country gentleman.
He’s done no more than other knights have done.
He’s broke a staff or so, so let it pass. THAISA aside To me he seems like diamond to glass. PERICLES aside Yon king’s to me like to my father’s picture,
Which tells me in what glory once he was—
Had princes sit like stars about his throne,
And he the sun for them to reverence.
None that beheld him but like lesser lights
Did vail their crowns to his supremacy;
Where now his son’s a glow-worm in the night,
The which hath fire in darkness, none in light;
Whereby I see that time’s the king of men;
He’s both their parent and he is their grave,
And gives them what he will, not what they crave.
