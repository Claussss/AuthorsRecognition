ISABELLA Alas, alas! CLAUDIO Sweet sister, let me live. What sin you do to save a brother’s life,
Nature dispenses with the deed so far
That it becomes a virtue. O, you beast! O faithless coward, O dishonest wretch,
Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?
Is’t not a kind of incest to take life
From thine own sister’s shame? What should I think?
Heaven shield my mother played my father fair,
For such a warped slip of wilderness
Ne’er issued from his blood. Take my defiance,
Die, perish! Might but my bending down
Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed.
I’ll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,
No word to save thee.
