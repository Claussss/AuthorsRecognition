ALL (flinging up caps) God save the King! God save the King,
My good Lord Chancellor and the Earl of Surreyl And Doll desires it from her very heart
More’s name may live for this right noble part;
And whensoe’er we talk of Ill May Day
Praise More, whose honest words our falls did stay. In hope his highness’ clemency and mercy,
Which in the arms of mild and meek compassion
Would rather clip you, as the loving nurse
Oft doth the wayward infant, than to leave you
To the sharp rod of justice; so to draw you
To shun such lewd assemblies as beget
Unlawful riots and such traitorous acts
That, striking with the hand of private hate,
Maim your dear country with a public wound.
O God, that mercy, whose majestic brow
Should be unwrinkled, and that awe-full justice,
Which looketh through a veil of sufferance
Upon the frailty of the multitude,
Should with the clamours of outrageous wrongs
Be stirred and wakened thus to punishment!
But your deserved death he doth forgive.
Who gives you life, pray all he long may live.
