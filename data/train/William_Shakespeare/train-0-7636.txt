I was the foremost man in this rebellion,
And I the foremost that must die for it. Bravely, John Lincoln, let thy death express
That, as thou lived‘st a man, thou died’st no less. Doll Williamson, thine eyes shall witness it.
Then to all you that come to view mine end
I must confess I had no ill intent
But against such as wronged us overmuch.
And now I can perceive it was not fit
That private men should carve out their redress
Which way they list. No, learn it now by me:
Obedience is the best in each degree.
And, asking mercy meekly of my king,
I patiently submit me to the law.
But God forgive them that were cause of it;
And, as a Christian, truly from my heart,
I likewise crave they would forgive me too,
