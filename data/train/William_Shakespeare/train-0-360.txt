I grant, sweet love, that I did love a lady,
But she is dead. JULIA (aside) â€˜Twere false if I should speak it, For I am sure she is not buried. Say that she be, yet Valentine, thy friend,
Survives, to whom, thyself art witness,
I am betrothed. And art thou not ashamed
To wrong him with thy importunacy?
