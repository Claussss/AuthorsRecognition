ALCIBIADES Call’st thou that harm? Men daily find it. Get thee away,
And take thy beagles with thee. ALCIBIADES We but offend him. Strike! Exeunt to drum and fifeall but Timon That nature, being sick of man’s unkindness,
Should yet be hungry! He digs the earth Common mother—thou Whose womb unmeasurable and infinite breast
Teems and feeds all, whose selfsame mettle
Whereof thy proud child, arrogant man, is puffed
Engenders the black toad and adder blue,
The gilded newt and eyeless venomed worm,
With all th
Whereon Hyperion’s quick’ning fire doth shine—
Yield him who all thy human sons do hate
From forth thy plenteous bosom, one poor root.

Go great with tigers, dragons, wolves, and bears;
Teem with new monsters whom thy upward face
Hath to the marbled mansion all above
Never presented.
