Lo, thus by day my limbs, by night my mind, For thee, and for myself, no quiet find.
28 How can I then return in happy plight,
That am debarred the benefit of rest,
When day’s oppression is not eased by night,
But day by night and night by day oppressed,
And each, though enemies to either’s reign,
Do in consent shake hands to torture me,
The one by toil, the other to complain
How far I toil, still farther off from thee?
I tell the day to please him thou art bright,
And do‘st him grace when clouds do blot the heaven;
So flatter I the swart-complexioned night
When sparkling stars twire not thou gild’st the even.
