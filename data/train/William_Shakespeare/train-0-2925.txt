DROMIO OF EPHESUS I buy a thousand pound a year, I buy a rope. Exit ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS (to Angelo) A man is well holp up that trusts to you!
I promised your presence and the chain,
But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me.
Belike you thought our love would last too long
If it were chained together, and therefore came not.
