What plume of feathers is he that indited this letter?
What vane? What weathercock? Did you ever hear
better? I am much deceived but I remember the style. Else your memory is bad, going oâ€™er it erewhile. This Armado is a Spaniard that keeps here in court,
A phantasim, a Monarcho, and one that makes sport
To the Prince and his bookmates.
