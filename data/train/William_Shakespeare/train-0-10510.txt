Good my lord, be cured Of this diseased opinion, and betimes,
For ’tis most dangerous. Say it be, ’tis true. No, no, my lord. LEONTES It is. You lie, you lie. I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,
Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,
Or else a hovering temporizer, that
Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,
Inclining to them both. Were my wife’s liver
Infected as her life, she would not live
The running of one glass.
