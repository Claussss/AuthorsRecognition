KING CHARLES We have consented to all terms of reason. KING HARRY Is’t so, my lords of England? The King hath granted every article:
His daughter first, and so in sequel all,
According to their firm proposed natures. Only he hath not yet subscribed this:
where your majesty demands that the King of France,
having any occasion to write for matter of grant, shall
name your highness in this form and with this addition:
Notre tr
cher fils Henri, Roi
d’Angleterre, Heritier de France, and thus in Latin,
Praeclarissimus filius noster Henricus, Rex Angliae et
Haeres Franciae.
