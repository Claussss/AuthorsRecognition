Thou dost snore distinctly; There’s meaning in thy snores. I am more serious than my custom. You
Must be so too if heed me, which to do
Trebles thee o’er. Well, I am standing water. I’ll teach you how to flow. Do so; to ebb Hereditary sloth instructs me. If you but knew how you the purpose cherish
Whiles thus you mock it; how in stripping it
You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,
Most often do so near the bottom run
By their own fear or sloth.
