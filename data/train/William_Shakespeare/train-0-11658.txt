CARDINAL WOLSEY (to a secretary) A word with you. Let there be letters writ to every shire
Of the Kingâ€™s grace and pardon.
(Aside to the secretary) The grieved commons Hardly conceive of me. Let it be noised
That through our intercession this revokement
And pardon comes. I shall anon advise you
Further in the proceeding.
