GEORGE OF CLARENCE It shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed. My lord of Somerset, what youth is that
Of whom you seem to have so tender care? My liege, it is young Henry, Earl of Richmond. Come hither, England’s hope. King Henry lays his hand on Richmond’s head If secret powers Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts,
This pretty lad will prove our country’s bliss.
His looks are full of peaceful majesty,
His head by nature framed to wear a crown,
His hand to wield a sceptre, and himself
Likely in time to bless a regal throne.
Make much of him, my lords, for this is he
Must help you more than you are hurt by me.
