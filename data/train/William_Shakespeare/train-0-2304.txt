‘For where love reigns, disturbing jealousy
Doth call himself affection’s sentinel,
Gives false alarms, suggesteth mutiny,
And in a peaceful hour doth cry, “Kill, kill”, Distemp’ring gentle love in his desire,
As air and water do abate the fire. ‘This sour informer, this bate-breeding spy,
This canker that eats up love’s tender spring,
This carry-tale, dissentious jealousy,
That sometime true news, sometime false doth bring,
