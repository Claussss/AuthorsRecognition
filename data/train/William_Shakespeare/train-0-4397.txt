My lord and lady, it is now our time
That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper
To cry ’Good joy, good joy, my lord and ladyl’ My lord Bassanio, and my gentle lady,
I wish you all the joy that you can wish,
For I am sure you can wish none from me.
And when your honours mean to solemnize
The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you
Even at that time I may be married too.
