PRINCE OF WALES Back with the beast unto the beast that sent him!
Tell him I cannot sit a coward’s horse.
Bid him today bestride the jade himself,
For I will stain my horse quite o‘er with blood
And double-gild my spurs, but I will catch him.
So tell the cap’ring boy, and get thee gone. SECOND HERALD I go.
