Nay, stand thou back! I will not budge a foot.
This be Damascus, be thou cursed Cain,
To slay thy brother Abel, if thou wilt. I will not slay thee, but I’ll drive thee back.
Thy purple robes, as a child’s bearing-cloth,
I’ll use to carry thee out of this place. Do what thou dar’st, I beard thee to thy face.
