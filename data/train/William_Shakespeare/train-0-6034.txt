Read the will. We’ll hear it, Antony.
You shall read us the will, Caesar’s will. Will you be patient? Will you stay a while?
I have o’ershot myself to tell you of it.
I fear I wrong the honourable men
Whose daggers have stabbed Caesar; I do fear it. ALL THE PLEBEIANS The will, the testament! You will compel me then to read the will?
Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,
And let me show you him that made the will.
Shall I descend? And will you give me leave?
