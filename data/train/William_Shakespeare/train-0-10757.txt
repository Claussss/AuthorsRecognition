O, she’s warm! If this be magic, let it be an art
Lawful as eating. POLIXENES She embraces him. CAMILLO She hangs about his neck. If she pertain to life, let her speak too. Ay, and make it manifest where she has lived,
Or how stol’n from the dead. PAULINA That she is living, Were it but told you, should be hooted at
Like an old tale. But it appears she lives,
Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.
(To Perdita) Please you to interpose, fair madam.
Kneel,
And pray your mother’s blessing.—Turn, good lady,
Our Perdita is found.
