Had you such leisure in the time of death,
To gaze upon these secrets of the deep? Methought I had, and often did I strive
To yield the ghost, but still the envious flood
Stopped-in my soul and would not let it forth
To find the empty, vast, and wandâ€™ring air,
But smothered it within my panting bulk,
Who almost burst to belch it in the sea.
