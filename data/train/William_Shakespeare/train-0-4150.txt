KING PHILIP O fair affliction, peace I No, no, I will not, having breath to cry.
O, that my tongue were in the thunder’s mouth!
Then with a passion would I shake the world,
And rouse from sleep that fell anatomy,
Which cannot hear a lady’s feeble voice,
Which scorns a modern invocation. Lady, you utter madness, and not sorrow.
