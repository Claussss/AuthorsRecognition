They come now. Set thy countenance, act thy part
With a firm boldness, and thou winnest my heart. Music. Enter Surrey, Erasmus, and attendants Now, great Erasmus, you approach the presence
Of a most learned worthy gentleman.
This little isle holds not a truer friend
Unto the arts; nor doth his greatness add
A feigned flourish to his worthy merit.
He’s great in study: that’s the statist’s grace
That gains more reverence than the outward place.
