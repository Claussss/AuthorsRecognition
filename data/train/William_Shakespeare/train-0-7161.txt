TROILUS (to Cressida) You know now your hostages: your uncle’s word and my firm faith. PANDARUS Nay, I’ll give my word for her too. Our kindred, though they be long ere they are wooed, they are constant being won. They are burrs, I can tell you: they’ll stick where they are thrown. Boldness comes to me now, and brings me heart.
Prince Troilus, I have loved you night and day
For many weary months.
