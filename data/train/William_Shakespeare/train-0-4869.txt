Enter Sir John Falstaff and Pistol 
SIR JOHN I will not lend thee a penny. I will retort the sum in equipage. SIR JOHN Not a penny. PISTOL drawing his sword SIR JOHN Not a penny. I have been content, sir, you should lay my countenance to pawn. I have grated upon my good friends for three reprieves for you and your coach-fellow Nim, or else you had looked through the grate like a gemini of baboons. I am damned in hell for swearing to gentlemen my friends you were good soldiers and tall fellows. And when Mistress Bridget lost the handle of her fan, I tookâ€™t upon mine honour thou hadst it not.
