OTHELLO Dost thou hear, Iago? I will be found most cunning in my patience,
But—dost thou hear?—most bloody. IAGO That’s not amiss, But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw? Othello
stands apart Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,
A hussy that by selling her desires
Buys herself bread and cloth. It is a creature
That dotes on Cassio—as ’tis the strumpet’s plague
To beguile many and be beguiled by one.
He, when he hears of her, cannot restrain
From the excess of laughter.
