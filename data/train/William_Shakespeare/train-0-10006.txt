SECOND GENTLEMAN Most likely, sir. CERIMON Nay, certainly tonight, For look how fresh she looks. They were too rash
That threw her in the sea. Make a fire within.
Fetch hither all my boxes in my closet. Exit Philemon
Death may usurp on nature many hours,
And yet the fire of life kindle again
The oâ€™erpressed spirits. I have heard
Of an Egyptian nine hours dead
Who was by good appliances recovered.
