ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Ay, to a niggardly host and more sparing guest.
But though my cates be mean, take them in good part.
Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.
But soft, my door is locked. (To Dromio) Go bid them let us in. DROMIO OF EPHESUS (calling) Maud, Bridget, Marian, Cicely, Gillian, Ginn!
