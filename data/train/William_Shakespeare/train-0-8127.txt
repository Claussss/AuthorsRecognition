BRABANZIO What, have you lost your wits? Most reverend signor, do you know my voice? BRABANZIO Not I. What are you? RODERIGO My name is Roderigo. BRABANZIO The worser welcome. I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors.
In honest plainness thou hast heard me say
My daughter is not for thee, and now in madness,
Being full of supper and distempering draughts,
Upon malicious bravery dost thou come
To start my quiet.
