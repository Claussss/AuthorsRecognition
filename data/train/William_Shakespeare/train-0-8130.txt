BRABANZIO (calling) Strike on the tinder, ho! Give me a taper, call up all my people.
This accident is not unlike my dream;
Belief of it oppresses me already.
Light, I say, light! IAGO Farewell, for I must leave you. It seems not meet nor wholesome to my place
To be producted—as, if I stay, I shall—
Against the Moor, for I do know the state,
However this may gall him with some check,
Cannot with safety cast him, for he’s embarked
With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,
Which even now stands in act, that, for their souls,
Another of his fathom they have none
To lead their business, in which regard—
Though I do hate him as I do hell pains—
Yet for necessity of present life
I must show out a flag and sign of love,
Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find
him,
Lead to the Sagittary the raised search,
And there will I be with him. So farewell. Exit
Enter below Brabanzio in his nightgown, and
servants with torches
