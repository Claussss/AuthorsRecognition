CLAUDIO But is there any? ISABELLA Yes, brother, you may live. There is a devilish mercy in the judge,
If you’ll implore it, that will free your life,
But fetter you till death. Perpetual durance? Ay, just, perpetual durance; a restraint,
Though all the world’s vastidity you had,
To a determined scope.
