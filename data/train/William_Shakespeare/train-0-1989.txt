SECOND CITIZEN In him there is a hope of government,
Which in his nonage council under him,
And in his full and ripened years himself,
No doubt shall then, and till then, govern well. FIRST CITIZEN So stood the state when Henry the Sixth
Was crowned in Paris but at nine months old. THIRD CITIZEN Stood the state so? No, no, good friends, God wot.
For then this land was famously enriched
With politic, grave counsel; then the King
Had virtuous uncles to protect his grace.
