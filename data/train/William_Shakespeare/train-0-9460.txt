What mean you, sir, To give them this discomfort? Look, they weep,
And I, an ass, am onion-eyed. For shame,
Transform us not to women. Ho, ho, ho, Now the witch take me if I meant it thus!
Grace grow where those drops fall. My hearty friends,
You take me in too dolorous a sense;
For I spake to you for your comfort, did desire you
To burn this night with torches. Know, my hearts,
I hope well of tomorrow, and will lead you
Where rather I’ll expect victorious life
Than death and honour. Let’s to supper, come,
And drown consideration.
