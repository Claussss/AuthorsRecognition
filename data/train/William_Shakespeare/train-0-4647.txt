Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat. Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head
Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye
And sandy-bottomed Severn have I sent him
Bootless home, and weather-beaten back. Home without boots, and in foul weather too!
How scapes he agues, in the devilâ€™s name?
