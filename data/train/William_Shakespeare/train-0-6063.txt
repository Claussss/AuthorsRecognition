CASSIUS Is it come to this? You say you are a better soldier.
Let it appear so, make your vaunting true,
And it shall please me well. For mine own part,
I shall be glad to learn of noble men. You wrong me every way, you wrong me, Brutus.
I said an elder soldier, not a better.
Did I say better? BRUTUS If you did, I care not.
