Aemilius, do this message honourably,
And if he stand on hostage for his safety,
Bid him demand what pledge will please him best. Your bidding shall I do effectually. Exit Now will I to that old Andronicus,
And temper him with all the art I have
To pluck proud Lucius from the warlike Goths.
And now, sweet Emperor, be blithe again,
And bury all thy fear in my devices.
