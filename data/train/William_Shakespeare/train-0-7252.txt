Sir, I foretold you then what would ensue.
My prophecy is but half his journey yet;
For yonder walls that pertly front your town,
Yon towers whose wanton tops do buss the clouds,
Must kiss their own feet. HECTOR I must not believe you. There they stand yet, and modestly I think
The fall of every Phrygian stone will cost
A drop of Grecian blood. The end crowns all,
And that old common arbitrator Time
Will one day end it.
