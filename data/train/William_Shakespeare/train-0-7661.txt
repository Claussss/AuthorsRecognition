I doubt him not To be as near the life of excellence
As you proclaim him, when his meanest servants
Are of some weight. You saw, my lord, his porter
Give entertainment to us at the gate
In Latin good phrase. Whatâ€™s the master, then,
When such good parts shine in his meanest men? His lordship hath some weighty business,
For, see, as yet he takes no notice of us.
