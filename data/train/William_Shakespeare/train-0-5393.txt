BENEDICK I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and so good a continuer. But keep your way, o’ God’s name. I have done. BEATRICE You always end with a jade’s trick. I know you of old. DON PEDRO That is the sum of all, Leonato. Signor Claudio and Signor Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at the least a month, and he heartily prays some occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no hypocrite, but prays from his heart.
