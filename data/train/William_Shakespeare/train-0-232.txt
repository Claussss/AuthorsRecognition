JULIA Come, come, will’t please you go? 
1.3
Enter Antonio and Panthino Tell me, Panthino, what sad talk was that
Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister? ‘Twas of his nephew Proteus, your son. Why, what of him? PANTHINO He wondered that your lordship Would suffer him to spend his youth at home
While other men, of slender reputation,
Put forth their sons to seek preferment out—
Some to the wars, to try their fortune there,
Some to discover islands far away,
Some to the studious universities.
For any or for all these exercises
He said that Proteus your son was meet,
And did request me to importune you
To let him spend his time no more at home,
Which would be great impeachment to his age
In having known no travel in his youth.
