Pray you lead on. At every house I’ll call;
I may command at most. (Calling) Get weapons, ho,
And raise some special officers of night.
On, good Roderigo. I will deserve your pains. Exeunt 1.2
Enter Othello, Iago, and attendants with torches Though in the trade of war I have slain men,
Yet do I hold it very stuff o’th’ conscience
To do no contrived murder. I lack iniquity,
Sometime, to do me service. Nine or ten times
I had thought to’ve yerked him here, under the ribs.
