Nay, stay, Sir John, a while, and we’ll debate
By what safe means the crown may be recovered. What talk you of debating? In few words,
If you’ll not here proclaim yourself our king
I’ll leave you to your fortune and be gone
To keep them back that come to succour you.
Why shall we fight, if you pretend no title?
