THE play described in the 1623 Folio as The First Part of Henry the Fourth had been entered on the Stationersâ€™ Register on 25 February 1598 as The History of Henry the Fourth, and that is the title of the first surviving edition, of the same year. An earlier edition, doubtless also printed in 1598, is known only from a single, eight-page fragment. Five more editions appeared before the Folio.
