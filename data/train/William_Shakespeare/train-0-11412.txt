Be collected. No more amazement. Tell your piteous heart
Thereâ€™s no harm done. O woe the day! I have done nothing but in care of thee,
Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who
Art ignorant of what thou art, naught knowing
Of whence I am, nor that I am more better
Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell
And thy no greater father.
