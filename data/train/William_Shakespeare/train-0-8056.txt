I came to her from Claudio, and desired her
To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo
For her poor brother’s pardon. That’s he indeed. DUKE (to Lucio) You were not bid to speak. No, my good lord, Nor wished to hold my peace. I wish you now, then. Pray you take note of it;
And when you have a business for yourself,
Pray heaven you then be perfect.
