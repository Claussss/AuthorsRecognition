Know you not How your state stands i’th’ world, with the whole
world?
Your enemies are many, and not small; their practices
Must bear the same proportion, and not ever
The justice and the truth o’th’ question carries
The dew o’th’ verdict with it. At what ease
Might corrupt minds procure knaves as corrupt
To swear against you? Such things have been
done.
You are potently opposed, and with a malice
Of as great size. Ween you of better luck,
I mean in perjured witness, than your master,
Whose minister you are, whiles here he lived
Upon this naughty earth? Go to, go to.
You take a precipice for no leap of danger,
And woo your own destruction.
