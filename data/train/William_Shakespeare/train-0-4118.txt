Hail, you anointed deputies of God.—
To thee, King John, my holy errand is.
I Pandolf, of fair Milan Cardinal,
And from Pope Innocent the legate here, 65
Do in his name religiously demand
Why thou against the Church, our Holy Mother,
So wilfully dost spurn, and force perforce
Keep Stephen Langton, chosen Archbishop
Of Canterbury, from that holy see. 70
This, in our foresaid Holy Father’s name,
Pope Innocent, I do demand of thee.
