Enchanted Tarquin answers with surmise
In silent wonder of still-gazing eyes. This earthly saint adored by this devil
Little suspecteth the false worshipper,
For unstained thoughts do seldom dream on evil.
Birds never limed no secret bushes fear,
So guiltless she securely gives good cheer And reverent welcome to her princely guest,
Whose inward ill no outward harm expressed,
