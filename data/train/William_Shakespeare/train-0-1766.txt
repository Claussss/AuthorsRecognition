Wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus? My mistress is my mistress, this myself,
The figure and the picture of my youth.
This before all the world do I prefer;
This maugre all the world will I keep safe,
Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome. no By this our mother is for ever shamed. Rome will despise her for this foul escape.
