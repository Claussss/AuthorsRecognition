ALL THE GHOSTS Thanks, Jupiter. The marble pavement closes, he is entered
His radiant roof. Away, and, to be blest,
Let us with care perform his great behest. The ghosts vanish Posthumus awakes Sleep, thou hast been a grandsire, and begot
A father to me; and thou hast created
A mother and two brothers. But, O scorn,
Gone! They went hence so soon as they were born,
And so I am awake. Poor wretches that depend
On greatnessâ€™ favour dream as I have done,
Wake and find nothing. But, alas, I swerve.
Many dream not to find, neither deserve,
And yet are steeped in favours; so am I,
That have this golden chance and know not why.
What fairies haunt this ground? A book? O rare one,
Be not, as is our fangled world, a garment
Nobler than that it covers. Let thy effects
So follow to be most unlike our courtiers,
As good as promise.
