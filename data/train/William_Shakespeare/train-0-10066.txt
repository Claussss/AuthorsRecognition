Let not authority, which teaches you
To govern others, be the means to make you
Misgovern much yourself.
If you were born to honour, show it now;
If put upon you, make the judgement good
That thought you worthy of it. What reason’s in
Your justice, who hath power over all,
To undo any? If you take from me
Mine honour, you’re like him that makes a gap
Into forbidden ground, whom after
Too many enter, and of all their evils
Yourself are guilty. My life is yet unspotted;
My chastity unstained ev’n in thought.
Then if your violence deface this building,
The workmanship of heav‘n, you do kill your honour,
Abuse your justice, and impoverish me.
My yet good lord, if there be fire before me,
Must I straight fly and burn myself? Suppose this
house—
Which too too many feel such houses are—
Should be the doctor’s patrimony, and
The surgeon’s feeding; follows it, that I
Must needs infect myself to give them maint’nance?
