And now this lustful lord leapt from his bed,
Throwing his mantle rudely o‘er his arm,
Is madly tossed between desire and dread.
Th’one sweetly flatters, th’other feareth harm,
But honest fear, bewitched with lust’s foul charm, Doth too-too oft betake him to retire,
Beaten away by brainsick rude desire.
