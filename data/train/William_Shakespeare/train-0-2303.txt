When thou didst name the boar, not to dissemble,
I feared thy fortune, and my joints did tremble. â€˜Didst thou not mark my face? Was it not white?
Sawest thou not signs of fear lurk in mine eye?
Grew I not faint, and fell I not downright?
Within my bosom, whereon thou dost lie, My boding heart pants, beats, and takes no rest,
But like an earthquake shakes thee on my breast.
