I have, my lord, and their intent is this:
They humbly sue unto your excellence
To have a godly peace concluded of
Between the realms of England and of France. How doth your grace affect their motion? Well, my good lord, and as the only means
To stop effusion of our Christian blood
And â€™stablish quietness on every side.
