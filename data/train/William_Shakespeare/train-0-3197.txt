But what, but what—come they to visit us? They do, they do, and are apparelled thus Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.
Their purpose is to parley, to court and dance,
And every one his love-suit will advance
Unto his several mistress, which they’ll know
By favours several which they did bestow.
