All murders past do stand excused in this,
And this, so sole and so unmatchable,
Shall give a holiness, a purity,
To the yet-unbegotten sin of times,
And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest, 55
Exampled by this heinous spectacle. It is a damned and a bloody work,
The graceless action of a heavy handâ€”
If that it be the work of any hand.
