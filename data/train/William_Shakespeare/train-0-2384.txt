Far from the purpose of his coming thither
He makes excuses for his being there.
No cloudy show of stormy blust’ring weather
Doth yet in his fair welkin once appear
Till sable night, mother of dread and fear, Upon the world dim darkness doth display
And in her vaulty prison stows the day. For then is Tarquin brought unto his bed,
Intending weariness with heavy sprite;
For after supper long he questioned
With modest Lucrece, and wore out the night.
Now leaden slumber with life’s strength doth fight,
