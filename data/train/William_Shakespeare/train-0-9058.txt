2.2
Enter Lady Macbeth 
LADY MACBETH That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold.
What hath quenched them hath given me fire. Hark,
peace!—
It was the owl that shrieked, the fatal bellman
Which gives the stern’st good-night. He is about it.
The doors are open, and the surfeited grooms
Do mock their charge with snores. I have drugged
their possets
That death and nature do contend about them
Whether they live or die.
Enter Macbeth [above]
