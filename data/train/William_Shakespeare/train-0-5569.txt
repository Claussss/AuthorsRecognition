Signor Leonato, let the Friar advise you.
And though you know my inwardness and love
Is very much unto the Prince and Claudio,
Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in this
As secretly and justly as your soul
Should with your body. LEONATO Being that I flow in grief, The smallest twine may lead me. â€™Tis well consented. Presently away,
For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure.
(To Hero) Come, lady, die to live. This wedding day
Perhaps is but prolonged. Have patience, and endure.
