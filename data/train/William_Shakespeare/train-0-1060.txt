Enter Queen Margaret and Prince Edward Here comes the Queen, whose looks bewray her anger. I’ll steal away. KING HENRY Exeter, so will I. QUEEN MARGARET Nay, go not from me—I will follow thee. Be patient, gentle Queen, and I will stay. QUEEN MARGARET Who can be patient in such extremes?
Ah, wretched man, would I had died a maid
And never seen thee, never borne thee son,
Seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father.
Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?
Hadst thou but loved him half so well as I,
Or felt that pain which I did for him once,
Or nourished him as I did with my blood,
Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there
Rather than have made that savage Duke thine heir
And disinherited thine only son.
