THESEUS So it is. 5.6
Enter, guarded, Palamon and his three Knights pinioned; enter with them the Jailer and an executioner with block and axe There’s many a man alive that hath outlived
The love o’th’ people; yea, i’th’ selfsame state
Stands many a father with his child: some comfort
We have by so considering. We expire,
And not without men’s pity; to live still,
Have their good wishes. We prevent
The loathsome misery of age, beguile
The gout and rheum that in lag hours attend
For grey approachers; we come towards the gods
Young and unwappered, not halting under crimes
Many and state—that sure shall please the gods
Sooner than such, to give us nectar with ’em,
For we are more clear spirits. My dear kinsmen,
Whose lives for this poor comfort are laid down,
You have sold ’em too too cheap.
