Suppose the singing birds musicians,
The grass whereon thou tread’st the presence strewed,
The flowers fair ladies, and thy steps no more
Than a delightful measure or a dance;
For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite
The man that mocks at it and sets it light. d. AFTER 3.2.28 The means that heavens yield must be embraced
And not neglected; else heaven would,
And we will not: heaven’s offer we refuse,
The proffered means of succour and redress.
