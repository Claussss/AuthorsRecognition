Little again? Nothing but ‘low’ and ‘little’?—
Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?
Let me come to her. LYSANDER Get you gone, you dwarf, You minimus of hind’ring knot-grass made,
You bead, you acorn. DEMETRIUS You are too officious In her behalf that scorns your services.
Let her alone. Speak not of Helena.
Take not her part. For if thou dost intend
Never so little show of love to her,
Thou shalt aby it.
