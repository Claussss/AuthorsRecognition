TIMON You gods reward them! Prithee, man, look cheerly. These old fellows
Have their ingratitude in them hereditary.
Their blood is caked, ‘tis cold, it seldom flows.
’Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind;
And nature as it grows again toward earth
Is fashioned for the journey dull and heavy.
Go to Ventidius. Prithee, be not sad.
Thou art true and honest—ingenuously I speak—
No blame belongs to thee. Ventidius lately
Buried his father, by whose death he’s stepped
Into a great estate. When he was poor,
Imprisoned, and in scarcity of friends,
I cleared him with five talents. Greet him from me.
Bid him suppose some good necessity
Touches his friend, which craves to be remembered
With those five talents. That had, give’t these fellows
To whom ‘tis instant due. Ne’er speak or think
That Timon’s fortunes ’mong his friends can sink.
