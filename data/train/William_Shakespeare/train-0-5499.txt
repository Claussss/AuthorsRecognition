He is the only man of Italy,
Always excepted my dear Claudio. I pray you be not angry with me, madam,
Speaking my fancy. Signor Benedick,
For shape, for bearing, argument, and valour
Goes foremost in report through Italy. Indeed, he hath an excellent good name. His excellence did earn it ere he had it.
When are you married, madam?
