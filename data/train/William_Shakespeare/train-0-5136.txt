MISTRESS QUICKLY O my most worshipful lord, anâ€™t please your grace, I am a poor widow of Eastcheap, and he is arrested at my suit. LORD CHIEF JUSTICE For what sum? MISTRESS QUICKLY It is more than for some, my lord, it is for all, all I have. He hath eaten me out of house and home. He hath put all my substance into that fat belly of his; (to Sir John) but I will have some of it out again, or I will ride thee a-nights like the mare.
