Who wanteth food and will not say he wants it,
Or can conceal his hunger till he famish?
Our tongues our sorrows dictate to sound deep
Our woes into the air, our eyes to weep
Till lungs fetch breath that may proclaim them louder,
That, if heav’n slumber while their creatures want,
They may awake their helps to comfort them.
I’ll then discourse our woes, felt sev’ral years,
And, wanting breath to speak, help me with tears.
