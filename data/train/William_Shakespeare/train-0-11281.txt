No single soul Can we set eye on, but in all safe reason
He must have some attendants. Though his humour
Was nothing but mutation, ay, and that
From one bad thing to worse, not frenzy,
Not absolute madness, could so far have raved
To bring him here alone. Although perhaps
It may be heard at court that such as we
Cave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in time
May make some stronger head, the which he
hearing—
As it is like him—might break out, and swear
He’d fetch us in, yet is’t not probable
To come alone, either he so undertaking,
Or they so suffering. Then on good ground we fear
If we do fear this body hath a tail
More perilous than the head.
