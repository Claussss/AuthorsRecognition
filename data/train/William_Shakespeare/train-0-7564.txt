ALL JUSTICES We like it well, my lord; we’ll follow ye. Exeunt Lord Mayor and Justices Nay, plaintiff, go you too. Exit Smart
And officers,
Stand you aside, and leave the prisoner
To me a while. Exeunt all but More and Lifter Lifter, come hither. LIFTER What is your worship’s pleasure? Sirrah, you know that you are known to me,
And I have often saved ye from this place
Since first I came in office. Thou seest beside
That Justice Suresby is thy heavy friend,
For all the blame that he pretends to Smart
For tempting thee with such a sum of money.
I tell thee what: devise me but a means
To pick or cut his purse, and on my credit,
And as I am a Christian and a man,
I will procure thy pardon for that jest.
