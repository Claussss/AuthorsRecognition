Why, fare thee well, King; since thus thou wilt
appear,
Friendship lives hence, and banishment is here.
(To Cordelia) The gods to their protection take thee,
maid,
That rightly thinks, and hast most justly said. (To Gonoril and Regan) And your large speeches may your deeds approve,
That good effects may spring from words of love.
Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;
Heâ€™ll shape his old course in a country new.
