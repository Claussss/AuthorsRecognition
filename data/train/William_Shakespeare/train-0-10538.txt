I dare my life lay down, and will do‘t, sir,
Please you t’accept it, that the Queen is spotless
I’th’ eyes of heaven and to you—I mean
In this which you accuse her. ANTIGONUS (to Leontes) If it prove She’s otherwise, I’ll keep my stables where
I lodge my wife, I’ll go in couples with her;
Than when I feel and see her, no farther trust her.
For every inch of woman in the world,
Ay, every dram of woman’s flesh is false
If she be.
