3.2
Enter Baptista, Gremio, Tranio as Lucentio, Katherine, Bianca, and others, attendants 
BAPTISTA (to Tranio) Signor Lucentio, this is the â€˜pointed day
That Katherine and Petruccio should be married,
And yet we hear not of our son-in-law.
What will be said, what mockery will it be,
To want the bridegroom when the priest attends
To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage?
What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?
