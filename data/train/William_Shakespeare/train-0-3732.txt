Art thou gone so, love, lord, my husband, friend?
I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
For in a minute there are many days.
O, by this count I shall be much in years
Ere I again behold my Romeo. ROMEO Farewell. I will omit no opportunity
That may convey my greetings, love, to thee. O, thinkâ€™st thou we shall ever meet again?
