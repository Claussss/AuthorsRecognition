Flourish. Trumpets sound, and drums ALL Martius Caius Coriolanus! CORIOLANUS (to Cominius) I will go wash, And when my face is fair you shall perceive
Whether I blush or no. Howbeit, I thank you.
I mean to stride your steed, and at all times
To undercrest your good addition
To thâ€™ fairness of my power.
