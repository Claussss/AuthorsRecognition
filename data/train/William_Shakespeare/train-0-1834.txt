Lucius, Marcus, and the others come down Lucius, all hail, Rome’s gracious governor! Thanks, gentle Romans. May I govern so
To heal Rome’s harms and wipe away her woe.
But, gentle people, give me aim awhile,
For nature puts me to a heavy task.
Stand all aloof, but, uncle, draw you near
To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk.
(Kissing Titus) O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold
lips,
These sorrowful drops upon thy bloodstained face,
The last true duties of thy noble son.
