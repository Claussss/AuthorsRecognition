MARCELLUS Is it not like the King? HORATIO As thou art to thyself. Such was the very armour he had on
When he th‘ambitious Norway combated.
So frowned he once when in an angry parley
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
’Tis strange. Thus twice before, and just at this dead hour,
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
