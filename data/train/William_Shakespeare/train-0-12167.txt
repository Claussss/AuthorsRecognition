Is this winning?
 O all you heavenly powers, where is your mercy?
But that your wills have said it must be so,
And charge me live to comfort this unfriended,
This miserable prince, that cuts away
A life more worthy from him than all women,
I should and would die too. Infinite pity
 That four such eyes should be so fixed on one
That two must needs be blind forâ€™t.
