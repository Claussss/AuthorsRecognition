Enter Iden with Cadeâ€™s head If one so rude and of so mean condition
May pass into the presence of a king,
Kneeling
The head of Cade, whom I in combat slew. The head of Cade? Great God, how just art thou!
O let me view his visage, being dead,
That living wrought me such exceeding trouble.
Tell me, my friend, art thou the man that slew him?
