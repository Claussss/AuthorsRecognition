Enter Philemonwith napkins and fire Well said, well said, the fire and cloths.
The still and woeful music that we have,
Cause it to sound, beseech you. The vial once more. How thou stirr‘st, thou block! The music there!
I pray you give her air. Gentlemen,
This queen will live. Nature awakes, a warmth
Breathes out of her. She hath not been entranced
Above five hours. See how she ’gins to blow
Into life’s flow’r again.
