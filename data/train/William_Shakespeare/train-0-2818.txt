QUEEN PHILIPPA Ah, me! Is this my welcome into France?
Is this the comfort that I looked to have
When I should meet with my beloved son?
Sweet Ned, I would thy mother, in the sea,
Had been prevented of this mortal grief. KING EDWARD Content thee, Philip. ’Tis not tears will serve
To call him back if he be taken hence.
Comfort thyself as I do, gentle Queen,
With hope of sharp, unheard-of, dire revenge!
He bids me to provide his funeral!
And so I will, but all the peers in France
Shall mourners be, and weep out bloody tears
Until their empty veins be dry and sere.
The pillars of his hearse shall be their bones;
The mould that covers him, their city ashes;
His knell, the groaning cries of dying men;
And, in the stead of tapers on his tomb,
An hundred-fifty towers shall burning blaze
While we bewail our valiant son’s decease!
