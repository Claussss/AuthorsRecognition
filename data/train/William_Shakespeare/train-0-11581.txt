STEFANO Put off that gown, Trinculo. By this hand, I’ll have that gown. TRINCULO Thy grace shall have it. The dropsy drown this fool! What do you mean
To dote thus on such luggage? Let’t alone,
And do the murder first. If he awake,
From toe to crown he’ll fill our skins with pinches,
Make us strange stuff.
