The best and wholesom’st spirits of the night
Envelop you, good Provost! Who called here of late? PROVOST None since the curfew rung. DUKE Not Isabel? PROVOST No. DUKE They will then, ere’t be long. PROVOST What comfort is for Claudio? DUKE There’s some in hope. PROVOST It is a bitter deputy. Not so, not so; his life is paralleled
Even with the stroke and line of his great justice.
He doth with holy abstinence subdue
That in himself which he spurs on his power
To qualify in others. Were he mealed with that
Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous;
But this being so, he’s just.
