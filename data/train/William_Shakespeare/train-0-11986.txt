By heaven, she is a goddess! Do reverence. She is a goddess, Arcite. EMILIA (to her Woman) Of all flowers Methinks a rose is best. WOMAN Why, gentle madam? It is the very emblem of a maidâ€”
For when the west wind courts her gently,
How modestly she blows, and paints the sun
With her chaste blushes! When the north comes near
her,
Rude and impatient, then, like chastity,
She locks her beauties in her bud again,
And leaves him to base briers.
