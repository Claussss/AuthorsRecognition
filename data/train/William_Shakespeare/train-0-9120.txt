LADY MACBETH (aloud) My worthy lord, Your noble friends do lack you. I do forget. Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends.
I have a strange infirmity which is nothing
To those that know me. Come, love and health to all,
Then Iâ€™ll sit down.
(To an attendant) Give me some wine. Fill full.
Enter Ghost
