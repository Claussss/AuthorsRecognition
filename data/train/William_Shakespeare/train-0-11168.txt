Senseless? Not so. Enter a Messenger MESSENGER (to Cymbeline) So like you, sir, ambassadors from Rome;
The one is Caius Lucius. A worthy fellow, Albeit he comes on angry purpose now:
But that’s no fault of his. We must receive him
According to the honour of his sender,
And towards himself, his goodness forespent on us,
We must extend our notice. Our dear son,
When you have given good morning to your mistress,
Attend the Queen and us. We shall have need
T’employ you towards this Roman. Come, our queen.
