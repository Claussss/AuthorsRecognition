Exit Helicanus  Shall we refresh us, sir, upon your shore,
And give you gold for such provision
As our intents will need? With all my heart, sir, And when you come ashore I have a suit. You shall prevail, were it to woo my daughter,
For it seems you have been noble towards her. Sir, lend me your arm.
