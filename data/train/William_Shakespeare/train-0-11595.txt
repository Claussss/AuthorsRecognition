PROSPERO (to Gonzalo) First, noble friend, Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot
Be measured or confined. He embraces Gonzalo Whether this be Or be not, I’ll not swear. You do yet taste Some subtleties o’th’ isle that will not let you
Believe things certain.—Welcome, my friends all.
(Aside to Sebastian and Antonio)
But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded,
I here could pluck his highness’ frown upon you
And justify you traitors. At this time
I will tell no tales.
