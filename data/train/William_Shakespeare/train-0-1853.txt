BRACKENBURY I beseech your graces both to pardon me.
His majesty hath straitly given in charge
That no man shall have private conference,
Of what degree soever, with your brother. RICHARD GLOUCESTER Even so. An’t please your worship, Brackenbury,
You may partake of anything we say.
We speak no treason, man. We say the King
Is wise and virtuous, and his noble Queen
Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous.
We say that Shore’s wife hath a pretty foot,
A cherry lip,
A bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue,
And that the Queen’s kin are made gentlefolks.
How say you, sir? Can you deny all this?
