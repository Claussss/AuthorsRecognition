I am amazed, and know not what to say. Exit Oberon and Robin come forward This is thy negligence. Still thou mistak‘st,
Or else commit’st thy knaveries wilfully. Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook.
Did not you tell me I should know the man
By the Athenian garments he had on?—
And so far blameless proves my enterprise
That I have ’nointed an Athenian’s eyes;
And so far am I glad it so did sort
As this their jangling I esteem a sport.
