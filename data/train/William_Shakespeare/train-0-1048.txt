MONTAGUE (to York) Good brother, as thou lov‘st and honour’st arms,
Let’s fight it out and not stand cavilling thus. Sound drums and trumpets, and the King will fly. YORK Sons, peace! Peace, thou—and give King Henry leave to speak. Ah, York, why seekest thou to depose me?
Are we not both Plantagenets by birth,
And from two brothers lineally descent?
Suppose by right and equity thou be king—
Think’st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,
Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?
No—first shall war unpeople this my realm;
Ay, and their colours, often borne in France,
And now in England to our heart’s great sorrow,
Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?
My title’s good, and better far than his.
