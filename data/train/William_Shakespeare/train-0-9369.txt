Ha, my brave Emperor, Shall we dance now the Egyptian bacchanals,
And celebrate our drink? POMPEY Let’s ha’t, good soldier. ANTONY Come, let’s all take hands Till that the conquering wine hath steeped our sense
In soft and delicate Lethe. All take hands. Make battery to our ears with the loud music.
The while I’ll place you, then the boy shall sing.
The holding every man shall beat as loud
As his strong sides can volley.
