KING HENRY (reads) ‘What shall betide the Duke of Somerset?
Let him shun castles. Safer shall he be
Upon the sandy plains than where castles mounted
stand.’ CARDINAL BEAUFORT (to Gloucester) And so, my Lord Protector, by this means
Your lady is forthcoming yet at London.
(Aside to Gloucester)
This news, I think, hath turned your weapon’s edge.
