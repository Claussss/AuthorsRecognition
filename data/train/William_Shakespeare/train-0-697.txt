QUEEN MARGARET Th’excess of love I bear unto your grace
Forbids me to be lavish of my tongue
Lest I should speak more than beseems a woman.
Let this suffice: my bliss is in your liking,
And naught can make poor Margaret miserable
Unless the frown of mighty England’s King. Her sight did ravish, but her grace in speech,
Her words yclad with wisdom’s majesty,
Makes me from wond’ring fall to weeping joys,
Such is the fullness of my heart’s content.
Lords, with one cheerful voice, welcome my love.
