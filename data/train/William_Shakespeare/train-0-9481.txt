Enter Cleopatra
(To Scarus) Give me thy hand. To this great fairy I’ll commend thy acts,
Make her thanks bless thee.
(To Cleopatra, embracing her) O’thou day o’th’ world,
Chain mine armed neck; leap thou, attire and all,
Through proof of harness to my heart, and there
Ride on the pants triumphing. Lord of lords!
