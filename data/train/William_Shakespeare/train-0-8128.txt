RODERIGO Sir, sir, sir. BRABANZIO But thou must needs be sure My spirits and my place have in their power
To make this bitter to thee. Patience, good sir. What tell’st thou me of robbing? This is Venice.
My house is not a grange. RODERIGO Most grave Brabanzio, In simple and pure soul I come to you. IAGO (to Brabanzio) ’Swounds, sir, you are one of those that will not serve God if the devil bid you. Because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians, you’ll have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse, you’ll have your nephews neigh to you, you’ll have coursers for cousins and jennets for germans.
