DONALBAIN What is amiss? MACBETH You are, and do not know’t. The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood
Is stopped, the very source of it is stopped. Your royal father’s murdered. O, by whom? Those of his chamber, as it seemed, had done’t.
Their hands and faces were all badged with blood,
So were their daggers, which, unwiped, we found
Upon their pillows. They stared and were distracted.
No man’s life was to be trusted with them.
