Here come and sit where never serpent hisses;
And, being sat, I’ll smother thee with kisses, ‘And yet not cloy thy lips with loathed satiety,
But rather famish them amid their plenty,
Making them red, and pale, with fresh variety;
Ten kisses short as one, one long as twenty. A summer’s day will seem an hour but short,
Being wasted in such time-beguiling sport.’
