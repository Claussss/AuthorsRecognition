NORTHUMBERLAND No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay. Northumberland, I hold thee reverently.
Break off the parley, for scarce I can refrain
The execution of my big-swoll’n heart
Upon that Clifford, that cruel child-killer. I slew thy father—call’st thou him a child? Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,
As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland.
But ere sun set I’ll make thee curse the deed.
