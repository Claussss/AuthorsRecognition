The people fear me, for they do observe
Unfathered heirs and loathly births of nature.
The seasons change their manners, as the year
Had found some months asleep and leaped them over. The river hath thrice flowed, no ebb between, 125
And the old folk, timeâ€™s doting chronicles,
Say it did so a little time before
That our great grandsire Edward sicked and died.
