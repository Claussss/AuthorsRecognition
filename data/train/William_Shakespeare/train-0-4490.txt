BASSANIO (aside) Why, I were best to cut my left hand off
And swear I lost the ring defending it. GRAZIANO to Portia My lord Bassanio gave his ring away
Unto the judge that begged it, and indeed
Deserved it, too, and then the boy his clerk,
That took some pains in writing, he begged mine,
And neither man nor master would take aught
But the two rings.
