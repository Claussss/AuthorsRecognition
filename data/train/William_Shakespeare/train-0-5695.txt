No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best. I doubt not that, since we are well persuaded
We carry not a heart with us from hence
That grows not in a fair consent with ours,
Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish
Success and conquest to attend on us. Never was monarch better feared and loved
Than is your majesty. Thereâ€™s not, I think, a subject
That sits in heart-grief and uneasiness
Under the sweet shade of your government.
