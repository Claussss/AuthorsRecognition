Thou shalt be waking while I shed thy blood,
If from this presence thou dar’st go with me. Away, even now, or I will drag thee hence.
Unworthy though thou art, I’ll cope with thee,
And do some service to Duke Humphrey’s ghost. Exeunt Suffolk and Warwick What stronger breastplate than a heart untainted?
Thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just;
And he but naked, though locked up in steel,
Whose conscience with injustice is corrupted.
