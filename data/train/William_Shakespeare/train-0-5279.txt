ARCHBISHOP OF YORK Believe me, I am passing light in spirit. 311 So much the worse, if your own rule be true. Shout within PRINCE JOHN The word of peace is rendered. Hark how they shout. This had been cheerful after victory. ARCHBISHOP OF YORK A peace is of the nature of a conquest,
For then both parties nobly are subdued,
And neither party loser.
