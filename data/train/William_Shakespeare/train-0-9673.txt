PAROLES My lord, you give me most egregious indignity. LAFEU Ay, with all my heart, and thou art worthy of it. PAROLES I have not, my lord, deserved it. LAFEU Yes, good faith, every dram of it, and I will not bate thee a scruple. PAROLES Well, I shall be wiser. LAFEU E‘en as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at a smack o’th’ contrary. If ever thou beest bound in thy scarf and beaten thou shall find what it is to be proud of thy bondage. I have a desire to hold my acquaintance with thee, or rather my knowledge, that I may say in the default, ‘He is a man I know’.
