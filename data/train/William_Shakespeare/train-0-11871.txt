God and your majesty Protect mine innocence, or I fall into
The trap is laid for me. Be of good cheer. They shall no more prevail than we give way to.
Keep comfort to you, and this morning see
You do appear before them. If they shall chance,
In charging you with matters, to commit you,
The best persuasions to the contrary
Fail not to use, and with what vehemency
Thâ€™occasion shall instruct you. If entreaties
Will render you no remedy, giving his ring
Deliver them, and your appeal to us
There make before them.
