THAISA (to Pericles) For every drop of blood he sheds of yours
He’ll draw another from his only child. KING SIMONIDES I’ll tame you, yea, I’ll bring you in subjection.
Will you not having my consent
Bestow your love and your affections
Upon a stranger?—(aside) who for aught I know
May be, nor can I think the contrary,
As great in blood as I myself.
