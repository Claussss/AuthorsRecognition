He takes up andreads aloud the riddle
I am no viper, yet I feed
 On mother’s flesh which did me breed.
 I sought a husband, in which labour
 I found that kindness in a father.
 He’s father, son, and husband mild;
 I mother, wife, and yet his child.
 How this may be and yet in two,
 As you will live resolve it you.
