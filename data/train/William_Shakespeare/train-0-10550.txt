Tell her, Emilia, I’ll use that tongue I have. If wit flow from’t
As boldness from my bosom, let’t not be doubted
I shall do good. Now be you blest for it! I’ll to the Queen. Please you come something nearer. Madam, if’t please the Queen to send the babe
I know not what I shall incur to pass it,
Having no warrant.
