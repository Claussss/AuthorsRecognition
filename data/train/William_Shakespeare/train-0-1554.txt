EXETER (aside) What, is my lord of Winchester installed
And called unto a cardinal’s degree?
Then I perceive that will be verified
Henry the Fifth did sometime prophesy:
‘If once he come to be a cardinal,
He’ll make his cap co-equal with the crown.’ My lords ambassadors, your several suits
Have been considered and debated on.
Your purpose is both good and reasonable,
And therefore are we certainly resolved
To draw conditions of a friendly peace,
Which by my lord of Winchester we mean
Shall be transported presently to France.
