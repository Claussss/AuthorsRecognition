Thank the heavens, lord, thou art of sweet composure.
Praise him that got thee, she that gave thee suck.
Famed be thy tutor, and thy parts of nature
Thrice famed beyond, beyond all erudition.
But he that disciplined thine arms to fight—
Let Mars divide eternity in twain,
And give him half. And for thy vigour,
Bull-bearing Milo his addition yield
To sinewy Ajax. I will not praise thy wisdom,
Which like a bourn, a pale, a shore confines
Thy spacious and dilated parts. Here’s Nestor,
Instructed by the antiquary times:
He must, he is, he cannot but be, wise.
But pardon, father Nestor: were your days
As green as Ajax’, and your brain so tempered,
You should not have the eminence of him,
But be as Ajax.
