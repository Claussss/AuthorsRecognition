LEAR (to Kent) What’s he that hath so much thy place mistook
To set thee here? KENT It is both he and she: Your son and daughter. LEAR No, I say. LEAR No, no, they would not. KENT Yes, they have. By Jupiter, I swear no. They durst not do‘t,
They would not, could not do’t. ’Tis worse than murder,
To do upon respect such violent outrage.
Resolve me with all modest haste which way
Thou mayst deserve or they propose this usage,
Coming from us.
