KING PHILIP Brother of England, you blaspheme in this. Though you and all the kings of Christendom
Are led so grossly by this meddling priest,
Dreading the curse that money may buy out, 90
And by the merit of vile gold, dross, dust,
Purchase corrupted pardon of a man,
Who in that sale sells pardon from himself;
Though you and all the rest so grossly led
This juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish; 95
Yet I alone, alone do me oppose
Against the Pope, and count his friends my foes.
