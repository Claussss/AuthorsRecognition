And my poor fool is hanged. No, no, no life?
Why should a dog, a horse, a rat have life,
And thou no breath at all? Thouâ€™lt come no more.
Never, never, never, never, never.
To Kent
Do you see this? Look on her. Look, her lips.
Look there, look there. He dies He faints. (To Lear) My lord, my lord! KENT to Lear
