But mine I am sure thou art, whoeâ€™er thou be,
And thus I win thee. They fight. The King being in danger, enter Prince Harry PRINCE HARRY Hold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art like
Never to hold it up again. The spirits
Of valiant Shirley, Stafford, Blunt, are in my arms.
It is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee,
Who never promiseth but he means to pay.
