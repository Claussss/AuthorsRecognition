RICHARD GLOUCESTER No doubt, no doubt. O, ‘tis a parlous boy,
Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable.
He is all the mother’s, from the top to toe. Well, let them rest.—Come hither, Catesby. Thou art
sworn
As deeply to effect what we intend
As closely to conceal what we impart.
Thou know‘st our reasons, urged upon the way.
What think’st thou? Is it not an easy matter
To make Lord William Hastings of our mind,
For the instalment of this noble duke
In the seat royal of this famous isle?
