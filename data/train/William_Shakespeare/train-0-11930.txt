Pray stand up: Your grief is written in your cheek. THIRD QUEEN You cannot read it there; there, through my tears,
Like wrinkled pebbles in a glassy stream,
You may behold ’em. The
Third Queen
rises Lady, lady, alack—
He that will all the treasure know o’th’ earth
Must know the centre too; he that will fish
For my least minnow, let him lead his line
To catch one at my heart. O, pardon me:
Extremity, that sharpens sundry wits,
Makes me a fool.
