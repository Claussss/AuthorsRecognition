Goths gag Aaron.
 Enter Aemilius My lord, there is a messenger from Rome
Desires to be admitted to your presence. LUCIUS Let him come near. Welcome, Aemilius. What’s the news from Rome? Lord Lucius, and you princes of the Goths,
The Roman Emperor greets you all by me,
And for he understands you are in arms,
He craves a parley at your father’s house,
Willing you to demand your hostages,
And they shall be immediately delivered.
