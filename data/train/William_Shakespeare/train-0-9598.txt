SECOND LORD DUMAINE They that least lend it you shall lack you first. I fill a place, I know’t.—How long is’t, Count,
Since the physician at your father’s died?
He was much famed. Some six months since, my lord. If he were living I would try him yet.—
Lend me an arm.—The rest have worn me out
With several applications. Nature and sickness
Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, Count.
My son’s no dearer.
