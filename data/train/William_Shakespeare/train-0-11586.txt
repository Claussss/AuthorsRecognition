5.1
Enter Prospero, in his magic robes, and Ariel Now does my project gather to a head.
My charms crack not, my spirits obey, and time
Goes upright with his carriage. How’s the day? On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord,
You said our work should cease. I did say so When first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit,
How fares the King and’s followers?
