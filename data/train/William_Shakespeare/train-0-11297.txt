Nothing ill come near thee. GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS Quiet consummation have,
And renowned be thy grave.
Enter Belarius with the body of Cloten in Posthumus’ suit We have done our obsequies. Come, lay him down. Here’s a few flowers, but ‘bout midnight more;
The herbs that have on them cold dew o’th’ night
Are strewings fitt‘st for graves upon th’earth’s face.
You were as flowers, now withered; even so
These herblets shall, which we upon you strow.
Come on, away; apart upon our knees
