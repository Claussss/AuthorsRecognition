HELEN All’s well that ends well yet, Though time seem so adverse, and means unfit.—
I do beseech you, whither is he gone? Marry, as I take it, to Roussillon,
Whither I am going. HELEN I do beseech you, sir, Since you are like to see the King before me,
Commend the paper to his gracious hand,
Which I presume shall render you no blame,
But rather make you thank your pains for it.
I will come after you with what good speed
Our means will make us means.
