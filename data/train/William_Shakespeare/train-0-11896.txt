The greatest monarch now alive may glory
In such an honour; how may I deserve it,
That am a poor and humble subject to you? KING HENRY Come, come, my lord—you’d spare your spoons. You shall have two noble partners with you—the old Duchess of Norfolk and Lady Marquis Dorset. Will these please you? (To Gardiner) Once more, my lord of Winchester, I
charge you
Embrace and love this man.
