KING EDWARD Then thus our steeled battles shall be ranged.
(To the Prince of Wales) The leading of the vanguard, Ned, is thine,
 To dignify whose lusty spirit the more
We temper it with Audley’s gravity,
That courage and experience, joined in one,
Your man
(To all) For the main battles I will guide myself,
And Derby in the rearward march behind,
That orderly disposed and set in ’ray
Let us to horse, and God grant us the day!
