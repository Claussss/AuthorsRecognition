ALL OF TARSUS fallingon their knees and weeping The gods of Greece protect you, and we’ll pray for you! PERICLES Arise, I pray you, rise. We do not look for reverence but for love,
And harbourage for me, my ships and men. The which when any shall not gratify,
Or pay you with unthankfulness in thought,
Be it our wives, our children, or ourselves,
The curse of heav’n and men succeed their evils!
Till when—the which I hope shall ne’er be seen—
Your grace is welcome to our town and us.
