For wise men are grown foppish, And know not how their wits to wear, Their manners are so apish. LEAR When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah? FOOL I have used it, nuncle, eSings And I for sorrow sung, That such a king should play bo-peep And go the fools among. Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to lie. I would fain learn to lie.
