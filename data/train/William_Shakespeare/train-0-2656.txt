KING EDWARD A kind and voluntary gift thou proffer’st
That I was forward to have begged of thee.
But, O, thou world, great nurse of flattery,
Why dost thou tip men’s tongues with golden words,
And peise their deeds with weight of heavy lead
That fair performance cannot follow promise?
O, that a man might hold the heart’s close book
And choke the lavish tongue when it doth utter
The breath of falsehood not charactered there!
