Thou speakest wonders. She shall be, to the happiness of England,
An aged princess. Many days shall see her,
And yet no day without a deed to crown it.
Would I had known no more. But she must die—
She must, the saints must have her—yet a virgin,
A most unspotted lily shall she pass
To th’ ground, and all the world shall mourn her.
