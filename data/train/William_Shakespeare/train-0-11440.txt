I thank thee, master. If thou more murmur’st, I will rend an oak,
And peg thee in his knotty entrails till
Thou hast howled away twelve winters. Pardon, master. I will be correspondent to command,
And do my spriting gently. PROSPERO Do so, and after two days I will discharge thee. That’s my noble master!
