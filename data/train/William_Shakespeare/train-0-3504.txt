Exeunt severally 5.3
Enter Bolingbroke, crowned King Henry, with Harry Percy, and other nobles 
KING HENRY Can no man tell of my unthrifty son?
‘Tis full three months since I did see him last.
If any plague hang over us, ’tis he.
I would to God, my lords, he might be found.
Enquire at London ’mongst the taverns there,
For there, they say, he daily doth frequent
With unrestrained loose companions—
Even such, they say, as stand in narrow lanes
And beat our watch and rob our passengers—
Which he, young wanton and effeminate boy,
Takes on the point of honour to support
So dissolute a crew.
