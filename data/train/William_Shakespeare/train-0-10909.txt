GONERIL (to Gloucester) My lord, entreat him by no means to stay. Alack, the night comes on, and the high winds
Do sorely ruffle. For many miles about
Thereâ€™s scarce a bush. O sir, to wilful men The injuries that they themselves procure
Must be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors.
He is attended with a desperate train,
And what they may incense him to, being apt
To have his ear abused, wisdom bids fear.
