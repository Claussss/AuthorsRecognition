LORD HASTINGS The tender love I bear your grace, my lord,
Makes me most forward in this princely presence
To doom th’offenders, whatsoe’er they be.
I say, my lord, they have deserved death. RICHARD GLOUCESTER Then be your eyes the witness of their evil:
See how I am bewitched. Behold, mine arm
Is like a blasted sapling withered up.
And this is Edward’s wife, that monstrous witch,
Consorted with that harlot, strumpet Shore,
That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.
