Give me the letter. I will look on it. He takes the letter  Where is the County’s page that raised the watch?
Sirrah, what made your master in this place? He came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave,
And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb,
And by and by my master drew on him,
And then I ran away to call the watch.
