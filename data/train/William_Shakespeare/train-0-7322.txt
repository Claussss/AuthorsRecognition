A retreat is sounded Hark, a retire upon our Grecian part. Another retreat is sounded The Trojan trumpets sound the like, my lord. The dragon wing of night oâ€™erspreads the earth
And, stickler-like, the armies separates.
My half-supped sword, that frankly would have fed,
Pleased with this dainty bait, thus goes to bed.
