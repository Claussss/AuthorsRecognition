When possibly I can I will return. If you turn not, you will return the sooner. She gives him a ring Keep this remembrance for thy Julia’s sake. Why then, we’ll make exchange. Here, take you this. He gives her a ring And seal the bargain with a holy kiss. Here is my hand for my true constancy.
And when that hour o’erslips me in the day
Wherein I sigh not, Julia, for thy sake,
The next ensuing hour some foul mischance
Torment me for my love’s forgetfulness.
My father stays my coming. Answer not.
The tide is now. (Julia weeps) Nay, not thy tide of tears,
That tide will stay me longer than I should.
Julia, farewell.
