How now, what do you here alone? Do not you chide. I have a thing for you. You have a thing for me? It is a common thing. IAGO To have a foolish wife. O, is that all? What will you give me now
For that same handkerchief? IAGO What handkerchief? EMILIA What handkerchief? Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona,
That which so often you did bid me steal.
