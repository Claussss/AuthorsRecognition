Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord. KING RICHARD O villains, vipers damned without redemption!
Dogs easily won to fawn on any man I
Snakes in my heart-blood warmed, that sting my heart!
Three Judases, each one thrice-worse than Judas
Would they make peace? Terrible hell make war
Upon their spotted souls for this offence!
