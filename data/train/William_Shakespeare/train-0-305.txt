What would your grace have me to do in this? There is a lady of Verona here
Whom I affect, but she is nice, and coy,
And naught esteems my aged eloquence.
Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor—
For long agone I have forgot to court,
Besides, the fashion of the time is changed—
How and which way I may bestow myself
To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.
