BOULT But can you teach all this you speak of? Prove that I cannot, take me home again
And prostitute me to the basest groom
That doth frequent your house. BOULT Well, I will see what I can do for thee. If I can place thee, I will. MARINA But amongst honest women. BOULT Faith, my acquaintance lies little amongst them; but since my master and mistress hath bought you, there’s no going but by their consent. Therefore I will make them acquainted with your purpose, and I doubt not but I shall find them tractable enough. Come, I’ll do for thee what I can. Come your ways.
