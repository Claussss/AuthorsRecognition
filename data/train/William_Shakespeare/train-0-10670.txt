Now, good Camillo, I am so fraught with curious business that
I leave out ceremony. Sir, I think You have heard of my poor services i’th’ love
That I have borne your father? Have you deserved. It is my father’s music
To speak your deeds, not little of his care
To have them recompensed as thought on.
