Warwick comes forward to the King Doth any name particular belong
Unto the lodging where I first did swoon? ’Tis called Jerusalem, my noble lord. Laud be to God! Even there my life must end.
It hath been prophesied to me many years
I should not die but in Jerusalem,
Which vainly I supposed the Holy Land;
But bear me to that chamber; there I’ll lie;
In that Jerusalem shall Harry die.
