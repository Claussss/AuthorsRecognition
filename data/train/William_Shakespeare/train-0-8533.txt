EDGAR I am sure onâ€™t, not a word. I hear my father coming. Pardon me.
In cunning I must draw my sword upon you.
Seem to defend yourself. Now, quit you well.
(Calling) Yield, come before my father. Light here,
here!
(To Edgar) Fly, brother, fly! (Calling) Torches, torches!
(To Edgar) So, farewell. Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion
Of my more fierce endeavour.
