That in the captain’s but a choleric word,
Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy. LUCIO (aside to Isabella) Art advised o’ that? More on’t. Why do you put these sayings upon me? Because authority, though it err like others,
Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself
That skins the vice o’th’ top. Go to your bosom;
Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know
That’s like my brother’s fault. If it confess
A natural guiltiness, such as is his,
Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
Against my brother’s life.
