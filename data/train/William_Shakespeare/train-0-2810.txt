KING EDWARD Although experience teach us this is true—
That peaceful quietness brings most delight
When most of all abuses are controlled—
Yet, insomuch it shall be known that we
As well can master our affections
As conquer other by the dint of sword,
Philip, prevail: we yield to thy request—
These men shall live to boast of clemency,
And, tyranny, strike terror to thyself.
