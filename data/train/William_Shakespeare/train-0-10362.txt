ADRIAN It is so, sir. Truly, I have forgot you. NICANOR I am a Roman, and my services are, as you are, against ’em. Know you me yet? ADRIAN Nicanor, no? NICANOR The same, sir. ADRIAN You had more beard when I last saw you, but your favour is well approved by your tongue. What’s the news in Rome? I have a note from the Volscian state to find you out there. You have well saved me a day’s journey.
