HORTENSIO (aside) I see she’s like to have nor cap nor gown. You bid me make it orderly and well,
According to the fashion and the time. Marry, and did, but if you be remembered
I did not bid you mar it to the time.
Go hop me over every kennel home,
For you shall hop without my custom, sir.
I’ll none of it. Hence, make your best of it.
