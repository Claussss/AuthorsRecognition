If, Duke of Burgundy, you would the peace
Whose want gives growth to thâ€™imperfections
Which you have cited, you must buy that peace
With full accord to all our just demands,
Whose tenors and particular effects
You have enscheduled briefly in your hands. The King hath heard them, to the which as yet
There is no answer made.
