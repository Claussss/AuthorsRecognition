A noise within within) Down with the tawny coats! What tumult’s this? WARWICK An uproar, I dare warrant, Begun through malice of the Bishop’s men. A noise again within) Stones, stones! Enter the Mayor of London O my good lords, and virtuous Henry,
Pity the city of London, pity us! so
The Bishop and the Duke of Gloucester’s men,
Forbidden late to carry any weapon,
Have filled their pockets full of pebble stones
And, banding themselves in contrary parts,
Do pelt so fast at one another’s pate
That many have their giddy brains knocked out.
Our windows are broke down in every street,
And we for fear compelled to shut our shops.
