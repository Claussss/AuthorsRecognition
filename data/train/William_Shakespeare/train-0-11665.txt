I told my lord the Duke, by th’ devil’s illusions
The monk might be deceived, and that ‘twas
dangerous
To ruminate on this so far until
It forged him some design which, being believed,
It was much like to do. He answered, ’Tush,
It can do me no damage’, adding further
That had the King in his last sickness failed,
The Cardinal’s and Sir Thomas Lovell’s heads
Should have gone off.
