SIMPCOX No indeed, master. GLOUCESTER What’s thine own name? Simon Simpcox, an it please you, master. Then, Simon, sit thou there the lying’st knave
In Christendom. If thou hadst been born blind
Thou mightst as well have known our names as thus
To name the several colours we do wear.
Sight may distinguish colours, but suddenly
To nominate them all—it is impossible.
Saint Alban here hath done a miracle.
Would you not think his cunning to be great
That could restore this cripple to his legs again?
