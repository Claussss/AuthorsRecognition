KING SIMONIDES What, are you merry, knights?  Who can be other in this royal presence? KING SIMONIDES Here with a cup that’s stored unto the brim,
As you do love, full to your mistress’ lips,
We drink this health to you. KING SIMONIDES Yet pause a while. Yon knight doth sit too
melancholy,
As if the entertainment in our court
Had not a show might countervail his worth.
Note it not you, Thaisa?
