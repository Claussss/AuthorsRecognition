CARDINAL WOLSEY (to the Queen) He tells you rightly. QUEEN KATHERINE Ye tell me what ye wish for both—my ruin.
Is this your Christian counsel? Out upon ye!
Heaven is above all yet—there sits a judge
That no king can corrupt. CARDINAL CAMPEIUS Your rage mistakes us. QUEEN KATHERINE The more shame for ye! Holy men I thought ye,
Upon my soul, two reverend cardinal virtues—
But cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear ye.
Mend ’em, for shame, my lords! Is this your comfort?
The cordial that ye bring a wretched lady,
A woman lost among ye, laughed at, scorned?
I will not wish ye half my miseries—
I have more charity. But say I warned ye.
Take heed, for, heaven’s sake take heed, lest at once
The burden of my sorrows fall upon ye.
