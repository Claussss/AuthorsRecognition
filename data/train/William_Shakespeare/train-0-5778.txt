Enter Sir Thomas Erpingham  Good morrow, old Sir Thomas Erpingham.
A good soft pillow for that good white head
Were better than a churlish turf of France. Not so, my liege. This lodging likes me better,
Since I may say, ‘Now lie I like a king.’ ’Tis good for men to love their present pains
Upon example. So the spirit is eased,
And when the mind is quickened, out of doubt
The organs, though defunct and dead before,
Break up their drowsy grave and newly move
With casted slough and fresh legerity.
Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas.
