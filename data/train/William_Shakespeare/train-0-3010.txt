ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS I never saw my father in my life. But seven years since, in Syracusa bay,
Thou know‘st we parted. But perhaps, my son,
Thou sham’st to acknowledge me in misery. ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS The Duke, and all that know me in the city,
Can witness with me that it is not so.
I ne’er saw Syracusa in my life.
