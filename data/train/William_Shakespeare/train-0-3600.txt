Music plays, and the masquers, guests, and gentlewomen dance. Romeo stands apart  A hall, a hall! Give room, and foot it, girls.
(To Servingmen) More light, you knaves, and turn the
tables up,
And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
(To his Cousin) Ah sirrah, this unlooked-for sport comes
well.
Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet,
For you and I are past our dancing days.
