O lady, lady, shame would have it hid! Was he not companion with the riotous knights
That tend upon my father? I know not, madam. ’Tis too bad, too bad. Yes, madam, he was of that consort. No marvel, then, though he were ill affected.
‘Tis they have put him on the old man’s death,
To have th’expense and spoil of his revenues.
I have this present evening from my sister
Been well informed of them, and with such cautions
That if they come to sojourn at my house
I’ll not be there.
