GEORGE BETTS Let some of us enter the strangers’ houses,
And, if we find them there, then bring them forth. Exeunt some, and Sherwin DOLL If ye bring them forth before ye find them, I’ll never allow of that. Now, lads, how shall we labour in our safety?
I hear the Mayor hath gathered men in arms,
And that Sheriff More an hour ago received
Some of the Privy Council in at Ludgate.
Force now must make our peace, or else we fall.
’will soon be known we are the principal.
