Here is her father’s house. I’ll call aloud. Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell
As when, by night and negligence, the fire
Is spied in populous cities. RODERIGO (calling) What ho, Brabanzio, Signor Brabanzio, ho! IAGO (calling) Awake, what ho, Brabanzio, thieves, thieves, thieves!
Look to your house, your daughter, and your bags.
Thieves, thieves!
