Enter the Lords [of Shrewsbury and Surrey], with Sir Thomas More, and attendants; and enter Lieutenant and Gentleman Porter SECOND WARDER Woman, stand back. You must avoid this place.
The lords must pass this way into the Tower. I thank your lordships for your pains thus far
To my strong-house. Now good Sir Thomas More, for Christâ€™s dear sake
Deliver me my writings back again
That do concern my title.
