IAGO O treacherous villains! (To Lodovico and Graziano)
What are you there? Come in and give some help. RODERIGO O, help me there! CASSIO That’s one of ’em. IAGO (stabbing Roderigo) O murderous slave! O villain! O damned Iago! O inhuman dog! Kill men i’th’ dark? Where be these bloody thieves?
How silent is this town! Ho, murder, murder!
(To Lodovico and Graziano)
What may you be? Are you of good or evil?
