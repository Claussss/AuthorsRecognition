FIRST LORD DUMAINE (to Bertram) If your lordship find him not a hilding, hold me no more in your respect. SECOND LORD DUMAINE (to Bertram) On my life, my lord, a bubble. BERTRAM Do you think I am so far deceived in him? SECOND LORD DUMAINE Believe it, my lord. In mine own direct knowledge—without any malice, but to speak of him as my kinsman—he’s a most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the owner of no one good quality worthy your lordship’s entertainment. 13
