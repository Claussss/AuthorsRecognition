JULIA Here comes the Duke. Enter the Duke How now, Sir Proteus. How now, Thurio.
Which of you saw Eglamour of late? PROTEUS Nor I. DUKE Saw you my daughter? PROTEUS Neither. Why then, she’s fled unto that peasant Valentine,
And Eglamour is in her company.
’Tis true, for Friar Laurence met them both
As he in penance wandered through the forest.
Him he knew well, and guessed that it was she,
But being masked, he was not sure of it.
Besides, she did intend confession
At Patrick’s cell this even, and there she was not.
These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence;
Therefore I pray you stand not to discourse,
But mount you presently, and meet with me
Upon the rising of the mountain foot
That leads toward Mantua, whither they are fled.
Dispatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me.
