Your unfortunate son, This is not well, rash and unbridled boy,
To fly the favours of so good a King,
To pluck his indignation on thy head
By the misprizing of a maid too virtuous
For the contempt of empire. Enter Lavatch LAVATCH O madam, yonder is heavy news within, between two soldiers and my young lady.
