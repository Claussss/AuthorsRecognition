Exit Tamora Tell us, old man, how shall we be employed? Tut, I have work enough for you to do.
Publius, come hither; Caius and Valentine. Enter Publius, Caius, and Valentine What is your will? Know you these two? The Empress’ sons I take them—Chiron, Demetrius. Fie, Publius, fie! Thou art too much deceived.
The one is Murder, and Rape is the other’s name.
And therefore bind them, gentle Publius;
Caius and Valentine, lay hands on them.
Oft have you heard me wish for such an hour,
And now I find it. Therefore bind them sure,
And stop their mouths if they begin to cry. Exit
