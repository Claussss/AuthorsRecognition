BENEDICK By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me. BEATRICE Do not swear and eat it. BENEDICK I will swear by it that you love me, and I will make him eat it that says I love not you. BEATRICE Will you not eat your word? BENEDICK With no sauce that can be devised to it. I protest I love thee. BEATRICE Why then, God forgive me.
