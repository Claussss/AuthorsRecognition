CAPULETâ€™S WIFE Ay, sir, but she will none, she gives you thanks.
I would the fool were married to her grave. Soft, take me with you, take me with you, wife.
How, will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?
Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,
Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
So worthy a gentleman to be her bride?
