A cell most meet for such a votary. FALKNER Well, sir, and I may perhaps be bailed ere’t be long, and yet wear my hair. They lead him out And Master Sheriff of London,
Here in his highness’ name we give you charge
Continual watch be kept throughout the city
For the suppressing of these mutinies.
And if hereafter any that belong
Either to my lord of Winchester or Ely
Do come into your city with a weapon,
Or above two of either faction
Shall be seen walking in the streets together,
Or meet in tavern or in ordinary,
They be committed presently to prison.
