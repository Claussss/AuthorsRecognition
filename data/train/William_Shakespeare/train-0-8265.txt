OTHELLO By heaven, I’ll know thy thoughts. You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;
Nor shall not whilst ’tis in my custody. IAGO O, beware, my lord, of jealousy. It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock
The meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss
Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger.
But O, what damned minutes tells he o’er
Who dotes yet doubts, suspects yet fondly loves!
