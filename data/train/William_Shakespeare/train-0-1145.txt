If friend or foe, let him be gently used. Revoke that doom of mercy, for ‘tis Clifford;
Who not contented that he lopped the branch
In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth,
But set his murd’ring knife unto the root
From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring—
I mean our princely father, Duke of York.
