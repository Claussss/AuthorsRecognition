For Antony, I have no ears to his request. The Queen
Of audience nor desire shall fail, so she
From Egypt drive her all-disgrac
Or take his life there. This if she perform
She shall not sue unheard. So to them both. Fortune pursue thee! Bring him through the bands. Exit Ambassador, attended (To Thidias) To try thy eloquence now ‘tis time.
Dispatch.
From Antony win Cleopatra. Promise,
And in our name, what she requires. Add more
As thine invention offers. Women are not
In their best fortunes strong, but want will perjure
The ne’er-touched vestal. Try thy cunning, Thidias.
Make thine own edict for thy pains, which we
Will answer as a law.
