DROMIO OF SYRACUSE (to Antipholus) I am transformed, master, am not I? ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE I think thou art in mind, and so am I. DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape. ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Thou hast thine own form. DROMIO OF SYRACUSE No, I am an ape. If thou art changed to aught, â€™tis to an ass.
