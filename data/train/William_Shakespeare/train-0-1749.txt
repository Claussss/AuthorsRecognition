O, why should nature build so foul a den,
Unless the gods delight in tragedies? Give signs, sweet girl, for here are none but friends,
What Roman lord it was durst do the deed.
Or slunk not Saturnine, as Tarquin erst,
That left the camp to sin in Lucreceâ€™ bed? Sit down, sweet niece. Brother, sit down by me.
