EDMUND This speech of yours hath moved me, And shall perchance do good. But speak you on—
You look as you had something more to say. If there be more, more woeful, hold it in,
For I am almost ready to dissolve,
Hearing of this. EDGAR This would have seemed a period To such as love not sorrow; but another
To amplify, too much would make much more,
And top extremity.
Whilst I was big in clamour came there in a man
Who, having seen me in my worst estate,
Shunned my abhorred society; but then, finding
Who ’twas that so endured, with his strong arms
He fastened on my neck and bellowed out
As he’d burst heaven; threw him on my father,
Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him
That ever ear received, which in recounting
His grief grew puissant and the strings of life
Began to crack. Twice then the trumpets sounded,
And there I left him tranced.
