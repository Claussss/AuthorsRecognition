QUEEN MARGARET This cheers my heart, to see your forwardness. Here pitch our battle—hence we will not budge. Flourish and march. Enter King Edward, Richard Duke of Gloucester, and George Duke of Clarence, with soldiers KING EDWARD (to his followers) Brave followers, yonder stands the thorny wood
Which, by the heavens’ assistance and your strength,
Must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night.
I need not add more fuel to your fire,
For well I wot ye blaze to burn them out.
Give signal to the fight, and to it, lords.
