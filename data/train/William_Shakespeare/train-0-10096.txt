PERICLES At sea? What mother? My mother was the daughter of a king,
Who died when I was born, as my good nurse
Lychorida hath oft recounted weeping. O, stop there a little! Aside
That e’er dulled sleep did mock sad fools withal.
This cannot be my daughter, buried. Well.
(To Marina) Where were you bred? I’ll hear you more
to th’ bottom
Of your story, and never interrupt you.
