I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirred you; but
I could afflict you farther. Do, Paulina, For this affliction has a taste as sweet
As any cordial comfort. Still methinks
There is an air comes from her. What fine chisel
Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,
For I will kiss her. Good my lord, forbear.
