He would not seem to know me. MENENIUS (to the tribunes) Do you hear? Yet one time he did call me by my name.
I urged our old acquaintance and the drops
That we have bled together. ‘Coriolanus’
He would not answer to, forbade all names.
He was a kind of nothing, titleless,
Till he had forged himself a name o’th’ fire
Of burning Rome.
