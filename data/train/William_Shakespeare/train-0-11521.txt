O most dear mistress, The sun will set before I shall discharge
What I must strive to do. If you’ll sit down I’ll bear your logs the while. Pray give me that;
I’ll carry it to the pile. No, precious creature. I had rather crack my sinews, break my back,
Than you should such dishonour undergo
While I sit lazy by.
