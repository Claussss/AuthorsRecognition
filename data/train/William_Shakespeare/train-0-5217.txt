Enter the Earls of Warwick and Surrey Many good morrows to your majesty! Is it good morrow, lords? WARWICK ’Tis one o’clock, and past. Why then, good morrow to you all, my lords.
Have you read o’er the letter that I sent you? WARWICK We have, my liege. Then you perceive the body of our kingdom,
How foul it is, what rank diseases grow,
And with what danger near the heart of it.
