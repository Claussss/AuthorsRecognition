PRINCE HENRY Even so must I run on, and even so stop.
What surety of the world, what hope, what stay,
When this was now a king and now is clay? BASTARD (to King John) Art thou gone so? I do but stay behind
To do the office for thee of revenge,
And then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven,
As it on earth hath been thy servant still.
(To the lords) Now, now, you stars that move in your
right spheres,
Where be your powers? Show now your mended
faiths,
And instantly return with me again,
To push destruction and perpetual shame
Out of the weak door of our fainting land.
Straight let us seek, or straight we shall be sought.
The Dauphin rages at our very heels.
