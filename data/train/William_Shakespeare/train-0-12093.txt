FIRST FRIEND These are strange questions. I do not think she was very well: for now
You make me mind her, but this very day
I asked her questions and she answered me
So far from what she was, so childishly,
So sillily, as if she were a fool,
An innocent—and I was very angry.
But what of her, sir? Nothing, but my pity
 But you must know it, and as good by me
As by another that less loves her—
