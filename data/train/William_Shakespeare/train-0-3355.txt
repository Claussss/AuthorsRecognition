KING RICHARD Can sick men play so nicely with their names? JOHN OF GAUNT No, misery makes sport to mock itself.
Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me,
I mock my name, great King, to flatter thee. KING RICHARD Should dying men flatter with those that live? JOHN OF GAUNT No, no, men living flatter those that die.
