Doubtless There is a best, and reason has no manners
To say it is not you. I was acquainted
Once with a time when I enjoyed a playfellow;
You were at wars when she the grave enriched,
Who made too proud the bed; took leave o’th’
moon—
Which then looked pale at parting—when our count
Was each eleven.
