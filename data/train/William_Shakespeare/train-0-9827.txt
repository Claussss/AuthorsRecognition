‘Tis past, my liege, And I beseech your majesty to make it
Natural rebellion done i’th’ blade of youth,
When oil and fire, too strong for reason’s force,
O’erbears it and burns on. My honoured lady, I have forgiven and forgotten all,
Though my revenges were high bent upon him 10
And watched the time to shoot.
