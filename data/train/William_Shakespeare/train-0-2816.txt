KING EDWARD We thank thee for thy service, valiant Earl.
Challenge our favour, for we owe it thee. EARL OF SALISBURY But now, my lord, as this is joyful news,
So must my voice be tragical again,
And I must sing of doleful accidents. KING EDWARD What, have our men the overthrow at Poitiers,
Or is our son beset with too much odds?
