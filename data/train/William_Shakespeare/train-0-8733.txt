Exeunt all but Edmund and the Captain EDMUND Come hither, captain. Hark. Take thou this note. Go follow them to prison.
One step I have advanced thee; if thou dost
As this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way
To noble fortunes. Know thou this: that men
Are as the time is. To be tender-minded
Does not become a sword. Thy great employment
Will not bear question. Either say thou’lt do’t,
Or thrive by other means.
