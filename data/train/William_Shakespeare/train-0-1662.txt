Marcus, for thy sake and thy brother’s here,
And at my lovely Tamora’s entreats,
I do remit these young men’s heinous faults.
Stand up! Marcus, Bassianus, Lavinia, and Titus’ sons stand Lavinia, though you left me like a churl,
I found a friend, and sure as death I swore
I would not part a bachelor from the priest.
Come, if the Emperor’s court can feast two brides
You are my guest, Lavinia, and your friends.
This day shall be a love-day, Tamora.
