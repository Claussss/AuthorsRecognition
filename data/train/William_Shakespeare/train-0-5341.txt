SILENCE (sings) Be merry, be merry, my wife has all,
For women are shrews, both short and tall,
â€™Tis merry in hall when beards wags all,
And welcome merry shrovetide. Be merry, be merry. JOHN I did not think Master Silence had been a man of this mettle. SILENCE Who, I? I have been merry twice and once ere now.
