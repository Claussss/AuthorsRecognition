The fingers of the powers above do tune
The harmony of this peace. The vision,
Which I made known to Lucius ere the stroke
Of this yet scarce-cold battle, at this instant
Is full accomplished. For the Roman eagle,
From south to west on wing soaring aloft,
Lessened herself, and in the beams o‘th’ sun
So vanished; which foreshowed our princely eagle
Th’imperial Caesar should again unite
His favour with the radiant Cymbeline,
Which shines here in the west.
