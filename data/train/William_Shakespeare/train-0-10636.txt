OLD SHEPHERD They call him Doricles, and boasts himself
To have a worthy feeding; but I have it
Upon his own report, and I believe it.
He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter.
I think so, too, for never gazed the moon
Upon the water as he’ll stand and read,
As ’twere, my daughter’s eyes; and to be plain,
I think there is not half a kiss to choose
Who loves another best.
