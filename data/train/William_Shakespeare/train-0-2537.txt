There pleading might you see grave Nestor stand,
As â€™twere encouraging the Greeks to fight,
Making such sober action with his hand
That it beguiled attention, charmed the sight.
In speech it seemed his beard all silver-white Wagged up and down, and from his lips did fly
Thin winding breath which purled up to the sky.
