MISTRESS PAGE Come, come, come! Enter John and Robert, with a buck-basket MISTRESS FORD Here, set it down. MISTRESS PAGE Give your men the charge. We must be brief. MISTRESS FORD Marry, as I told you before, John and Robert, be ready here hard by in the brew-house; and when I suddenly call you, come forth, and without any pause or staggering take this basket on your shoulders. That done, trudge with it in all haste, and carry it among the whitsters in Datchet Mead, and there empty it in the muddy ditch close by the Thamesâ€™ side.
