What makes your admiration? It cannot be i‘th’ eye—for apes and monkeys,
’Twixt two such shes, would chatter this way and
Contemn with mows the other; nor i‘th’ judgement,
For idiots in this case of favour would
Be wisely definite; nor i’th’ appetite—
Sluttery, to such neat excellence opposed,
Should make desire vomit emptiness,
Not so allured to feed.
