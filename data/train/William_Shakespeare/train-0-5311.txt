Where is the crown? Who took it from my pillow? When we withdrew, my liege, we left it here. The Prince hath taâ€™en it hence. Go seek him out.
Is he so hasty that he doth suppose
My sleep my death?
Find him, my lord of Warwick; chide him hither. Exit Warwick This part of his conjoins with my disease,
And helps to end me. See, sons, what things you are,
How quickly nature falls into revolt
When gold becomes her object!
For this the foolish over-careful fathers
Have broke their sleep with thoughts, their brains with
care,
Their bones with industry; for this they have
Engrossed and piled up the cankered heaps
Of strange-achieved gold; for this they have
Been thoughtful to invest their sons with arts
And martial exercises; when, like the bee
Culling from every flower the virtuous sweets,
Our thighs packed with wax, our mouths with honey,
We bring it to the hive; and, like the bees, 206
Are murdered for our pains. This bitter taste
Yields his engrossments to the ending father.
