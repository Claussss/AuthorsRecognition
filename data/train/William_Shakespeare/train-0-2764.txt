But will your highness fight today? KING OF FRANCE What else, my son? He’s scarce eight thousand strong,
And we are threescore thousand at the least. I have a prophecy, my gracious lord,
Wherein is written what success is like
To happen us in this outrageous war.
It was delivered me at Cr
By one that is an aged hermit there:
‘When feathered fowl shall make thine army tremble,
And flintstones rise and break the battle ’ray,
Then think on him that doth not now dissemble,
For that shall be the hapless dreadful day,
Yet in the end thy foot thou shalt advance
As far in England as thy foe in France.’
