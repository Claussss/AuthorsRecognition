QUEEN ELIZABETH Poor heart, adieu. I pity thy complaining. No more than with my soul I mourn for yours. Farewell, thou woeful welcomer of glory. Adieu, poor soul, that takâ€™st thy leave of it. DUCHESS OF YORK Go thou to Richmond, and good fortune guide thee. Exit Dorset Go thou to Richard, and good angels tend thee.
