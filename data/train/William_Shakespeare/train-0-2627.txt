KING EDWARD Lady, stand up. I come to bring thee peace,
However thereby I have purchased war. COUNTESS OF SALISBURY (rising) No war to you, my liege. The Scots are gone
And gallop home toward Scotland with their hate. KING EDWARD (aside) Lest yielding here I pine in shameful love—
(Aloud) Come, we’ll pursue the Scots. Artois, away!
