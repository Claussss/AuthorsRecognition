KING EDWARD Audley, content. I will not have a man,
On pain of death, sent forth to succour him.
This is the day ordained by destiny
To season his green courage with those grievous
thoughts
That, if he breaketh out, Nestorâ€™s years on earth
Will make him savour still of this exploit. EARL OF DERBY Ah, but he shall not live to see those days!
