A goodly day not to keep house with such
Whose roof’s as low as ours. Stoop, boys; this gate
Instructs you how t‘adore the heavens, and bows you
To a morning’s holy office. The gates of monarchs
Are arched so high that giants may jet through
And keep their impious turbans on without
Good morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven!
We house i’th’ rock, yet use thee not so hardly
As prouder livers do.
