What hast thou done? I am perfect what: cut off one Cloten’s head,
Son to the Queen after his own report,
Who called me traitor, mountaineer, and swore
With his own single hand he’d take us in,
Displace our heads where—thanks, ye gods—they
grow,
And set them on Lud’s town. We are all undone. Why, worthy father, what have we to lose
But that he swore to take, our lives? The law
Protects not us: then why should we be tender
To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us,
Play judge and executioner all himself,
For we do fear the law? What company
Discover you abroad?
