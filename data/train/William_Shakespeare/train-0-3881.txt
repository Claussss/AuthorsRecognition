Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,
You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius,
Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex. 240
We cannot fight for love as men may do;
We should be wooed, and were not made to woo.
Iâ€™ll follow thee, and make a heaven of hell,
To die upon the hand I love so well. Exit Demetrius, Helena following him
