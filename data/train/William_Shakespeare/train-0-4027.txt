PHILOSTRATE A play there is, my lord, some ten words long,
Which is as ‘brief as I have known a play;
But by ten words, my lord, it is too long,
Which makes it ’tedious’; for in all the play
There is not one word apt, one player fitted. 45 THESEUS What are they that do play it? PHILOSTRATE Hard-handed men that work in Athens here,
Which never laboured in their minds till now,
And now have toiled their unbreathed memories
With this same play against your nuptial. 50
