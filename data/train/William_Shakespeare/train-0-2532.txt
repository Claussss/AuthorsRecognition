That she her plaints a little while doth stay,
Pausing for means to mourn some newer way. At last she calls to mind where hangs a piece
Of skilful painting made for Priam’s Troy,
Before the which is drawn the power of Greece,
For Helen’s rape the city to destroy,
Threat’ning cloud-kissing Ilion with annoy;
