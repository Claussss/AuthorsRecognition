A little knock, my lord. There was even now
A sort of prentices playing at cudgels.
I did command them to their mastersâ€™ houses,
But one of them, backed by the other crew,
Wounded me in the forehead with his cudgel;
And now, I fear me, they are gone to join
With Lincoln, Sherwin, and their dangerous train.
