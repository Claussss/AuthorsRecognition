Capulet and his Cousin sit  How long is’t now since last yourself and I
Were in a masque? CAPULET’S COUSIN By’r Lady, thirty years. What, man, ’tis not so much, ’tis not so much.
’Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,
Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,
Some five-and-twenty years; and then we masqued.
