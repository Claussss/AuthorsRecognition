I heard nothing. O, ’twas a din to fright a monster’s ear,
To make an earthquake! Sure it was the roar
Of a whole herd of lions. Heard you this, Gonzalo? Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming,
And that a strange one too, which did awake me.
I shaked you, sir, and cried. As mine eyes opened
I saw their weapons drawn. There was a noise,
That’s verily. ’Tis best we stand upon our guard,
Or that we quit this place. Let’s draw our weapons.
