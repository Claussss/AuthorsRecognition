Music plays. Enobarbus places them hand in hand Come, thou monarch of the vine,
Plumpy Bacchus, with pink eyne!
In thy vats our cares be drowned,
With thy grapes our hairs be crowned!
Cup us till the world go round,
Cup us till the world go round! What would you more? Pompey, good night.
(To Antony)
