What country bred you? Thisâ€”but far off, prince. Are you a gentleman? My father said so, And to those gentle uses gave me life. Are you his heir? His youngest, sir. Your father Sure is a happy sire, then. What proves you? A little of all noble qualities.
I could have kept a hawk and well have hollered
To a deep cry of dogs; I dare not praise
My feat in horsemanship, yet they that knew me
Would say it was my best piece; last and greatest,
I would be thought a soldier.
