Itâ€™s an honourable kind of thievery. VALENTINE Peace, villain. SECOND OUTLAW Tell us this: have you anything to take to? VALENTINE Nothing but my fortune. THIRD OUTLAW Know, then, that some of us are gentlemen
Such as the fury of ungoverned youth
Thrust from the company of aweful men.
Myself was from Verona banished
For practising to steal away a lady,
An heir, and near allied unto the Duke.
