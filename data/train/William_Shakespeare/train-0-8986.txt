FLAVIUS (to Senators) Stay not; allâ€™s in vain. Why, I was writing of my epitaph.
It will be seen tomorrow. My long sickness
Of health and living now begins to mend,
And nothing brings me all things. Go; live still.
Be Alcibiades your plague, you his,
And last so long enough. FIRST SENATOR We speak in vain.
