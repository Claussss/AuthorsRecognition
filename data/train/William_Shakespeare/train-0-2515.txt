Poor Lucrece’ cheeks unto her maid seem so
As winter meads when sun doth melt their snow. Her mistress she doth give demure good-morrow
With soft slow tongue, true mark of modesty,
And sorts a sad look to her lady’s sorrow,
For why her face wore sorrow’s livery;
But durst not ask of her audaciously Why her two suns were cloud-eclips
Nor why her fair cheeks over-washed with woe.
