KING SIMONIDES Equals to equals, good to good is joined.
This not being so, the bavin of your mind
In rashness kindled must again be quenched,
Or purchase our displeasure.—And for you, sir,
First learn to know I banish you my court,
And yet I scorn our rage should stoop so low.
For your ambition, sir, I’ll have your life.
