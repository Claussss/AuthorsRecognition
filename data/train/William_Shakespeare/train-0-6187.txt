So was I when your highness took his dukedom;
So was I when your highness banished him.
Treason is not inherited, my lord,
Or if we did derive it from our friends,
Whatâ€™s that to me? My father was no traitor.
Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much
To think my poverty is treacherous. CELIA Dear sovereign, hear me speak.
