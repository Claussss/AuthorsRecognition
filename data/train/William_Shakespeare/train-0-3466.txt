I will be his conduct. BOLINGBROKE Lords, you that here are under our arrest,
Procure your sureties for your days of answer.
Little are we beholden to your love,
And little looked for at your helping hands. Enter Richard and the Duke of York, with attendants bearing the crown and sceptre Alack, why am I sent for to a king
Before I have shook off the regal thoughts
Wherewith I reigned? I hardly yet have learned
To insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend my knee.
Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me
To this submission. Yet I well remember
The favours of these men. Were they not mine?
Did they not sometime cry ‘All haill’ to me?
So Judas did to Christ. But He in twelve
Found truth in all but one; I, in twelve thousand, none.
God save the King ! Will no man say ‘Amen’ ?
Am I both priest and clerk? Well then, Amen.
God save the King, although I be not he.
And yet Amen, if heaven do think him me.
To do what service am I sent for hither?
