DAVY I beseech you, sir, to countenance William Visor of Wo’ncot against Clement Perks o’th’ Hill. SHALLOW There is many complaints, Davy, against that Visor. That Visor is an arrant knave, on my knowledge. DAVY I grant your worship that he is a knave, sir; but yet God forbid, sir, but a knave should have some countenance at his friend’s request. An honest man, sir, is able to speak for himself, when a knave is not. I have served your worship truly, sir, this eight years. An I cannot once or twice in a quarter bear out a knave against an honest man, I have little credit with your worship. The knave is mine honest friend, sir; therefore I beseech you let him be countenanced.
