Bring down the devil, for he must not die
So sweet a death as hanging presently. Goths bring Aaron down the ladder If there be devils, would I were a devil,
To live and burn in everlasting fire,
So I might have your company in hell
But to torment you with my bitter tongue. Sirs, stop his mouth, and let him speak no more.
