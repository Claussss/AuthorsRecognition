Assist me then, sweet Warwick, and I will,
For hither we have broken in by force. We’ll all assist you—he that flies shall die. Thanks, gentle Norfolk. Stay by me, my lords
And soidiers—stay, and lodge by me this night.
They go up upon the state And when the King comes, offer him no violence
Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.
