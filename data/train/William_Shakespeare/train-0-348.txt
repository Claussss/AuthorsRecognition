SECOND OUTLAW Indeed because you are a banished man,
Therefore above the rest we parley to you.
Are you content to be our general,
To make a virtue of necessity
And live as we do in this wilderness? THIRD OUTLAW What sayst thou? Wilt thou be of our consort?
Say ‘Ay’, and be the captain of us all.
We’ll do thee homage, and be ruled by thee,
Love thee as our commander and our king.
