QUEEN MARGARET (to Suffolkâ€™s head) Ah, barbarous villains! Hath this lovely face
Ruled like a wandering planet over me,
And could it not enforce them to relent,
That were unworthy to behold the same? Lord Saye, Jack Cade hath sworn to have thy head. Ay, but I hope your highness shall have his. KING HENRY (to Queen Margaret)
