Enter Cominius COMINIUS O, you have made good work! MENENIUS What news? What news? You have holp to ravish your own daughters and
To melt the city leads upon your pates,
To see your wives dishonoured to your noses. MENENIUS What’s the news? What’s the news? Your temples burned in their cement, and
Your franchises, whereon you stood, confined
Into an auger’s bore.
