For marks descried in men’s nativity
Are nature’s faults, not their own infamy.’ Here with a cockatrice’ dead-killing eye
He rouseth up himself, and makes a pause,
While she, the picture of pure piety,
Like a white hind under the gripe’s sharp claws,
Pleads in a wilderness where are no laws To the rough beast that knows no gentle right,
Nor aught obeys but his foul appetite.
