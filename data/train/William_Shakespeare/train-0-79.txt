(I Henry IV, 2.5.467) 
MARINA
 My name, sir, is Marina. (Pericles, 21.131) 
SHYLOCK [of a jewel] ... I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor. (Merchant of Venice, 3.1.113) If we refer to the context in which these lines occur, we find that they are, in turn, a jocular insult, a moment of revelation, and a nostalgic reflection; but we do not need to look up editorial notes to decide whether to laugh, cry, or sympathize as we take in what is said.
