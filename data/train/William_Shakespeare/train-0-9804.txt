DIANA Let death and honesty Go with your impositions, I am yours,
Upon your will to suffer. HELEN Yet, I pray you.— But with that word the time will bring on summer,
When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns
And be as sweet as sharp. We must away,
Our wagon is prepared, and time revives us.
All’s well that ends well; still the fine’s the crown.
Whate’er the course, the end is the renown.
