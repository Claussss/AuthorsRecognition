Let all the rest give place: Exeunt Curio and others Once more, Cesario,  Get thee to yon same sovereign cruelty.
Tell her my love, more noble than the world,
Prizes not quantity of dirty lands.
The parts that fortune hath bestowed upon her
Tell her I hold as giddily as fortune;
But â€™tis that miracle and queen of gems
That nature pranks her in attracts my soul.
