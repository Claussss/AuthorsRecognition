Enter Lord Hastings In happy time here comes the sweating lord. PRINCE EDWARD (to Hastings) Welcome, my lord. What, will our mother come? LORD HASTINGS On what occasion God he knows, not I,
The Queen your mother, and your brother York,
Have taken sanctuary. The tender Prince
Would fain have come with me to meet your grace,
But by his mother was perforce withheld.
