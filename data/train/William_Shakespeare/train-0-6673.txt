LAERTES What ceremony else? Her obsequies have been as far enlarged
As we have warrantise. Her death was doubtful,
And but that great command oâ€™ersways the order
She should in ground unsanctified have lodged
Till the last trumpet. For charitable prayers,
Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her,
Yet here she is allowed her virgin rites,
Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
Of bell and burial.
