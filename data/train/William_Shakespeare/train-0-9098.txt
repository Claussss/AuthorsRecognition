SECOND MURDERER We shall, my lord, Perform what you command us. FIRST MURDERER Though our lives— Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most
I will advise you where to plant yourselves,
Acquaint you with the perfect spy o‘th’ time,
The moment on’t; for’t must be done tonight,
And something from the palace; always thought
That I require a clearness; and with him,
To leave no rubs nor botches in the work,
Fleance, his son, that keeps him company—
Whose absence is no less material to me
Than is his father’s—must embrace the fate
Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart.
I’ll come to you anon.
