I humbly thank your highness. I do not bid thee beg my life, good lad,
And yet I know thou wilt. No, no. Alack, Thereâ€™s other work in hand. I see a thing
Bitter to me as death. Your life, good master,
Must shuffle for itself. The boy disdains me. He leaves me, scorns me. Briefly die their joys
That place them on the truth of girls and boys.
Why stands he so perplexed?
