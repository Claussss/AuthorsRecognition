Here, go—the desk, the purse! Sweet now, make haste! How? Hast thou lost thy breath? DROMIO or SYRACUSE By running fast. Where is thy master, Dromio? Is he well? DROMIO OF SYRACUSE No, he’s in Tartar limbo, worse than hell.
A devil in an everlasting garment hath him,
One whose hard heart is buttoned up with steel;
A fiend, a fairy, pitiless and rough;
A wolf, nay worse, a fellow all in buff;
A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that countermands
The passages of alleys, creeks, and narrow launds;
A hound that runs counter, and yet draws dryfoot well;
One that before the Judgement carries poor souls to hell.
