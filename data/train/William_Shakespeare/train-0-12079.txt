Next hear my prayers— Last let me entreat, sir— HIPPOLYTA Mercy. Mercy on these princes. Ye make my faith reel. Say I felt
Compassion to ’em both, how would you place it? Upon their lives—but with their banishments. You are a right woman, sister: you have pity,
But want the understanding where to use it.
If you desire their lives, invent a way
Safer than banishment. Can these two live,
And have the agony of love about ‘em,
And not kill one another? Every day
They’d fight about you, hourly bring your honour
In public question with their swords. Be wise, then,
And here forget ’em. It concerns your credit
And my oath equally. I have said—they die.
Better they fall by th’ law than one another.
Bow not my honour.
