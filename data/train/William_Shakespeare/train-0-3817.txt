Exeunt some Watchmen  Pitiful sight! Here lies the County slain,
And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
Who here hath lain this two days buried.
Go tell the Prince. Run to the Capulets,
Raise up the Montagues. Some others search. Exeunt other Watchmen severally  We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,
But the true ground of all these piteous woes
We cannot without circumstance descry.
