LUCIUS’ SERVANT So much? PHILOTUS’ SERVANT Is not my lord seen yet? LUCIUS’ SERVANT Not yet. PHILOTUS’ SERVANT I wonder on’t; he was wont to shine at seven. LUCIUS’ SERVANT Ay, but the days are waxed shorter with him.
You must consider that a prodigal course
Is like the sun‘s,
But not, like his, recoverable. I fear
’Tis deepest winter in Lord Timon’s purse; that is,
One may reach deep enough, and yet find little.
