Sweethearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,
If fairings come thus plentifully in.
A lady walled about with diamonds—
Look you what I have from the loving King. Madam, came nothing else along with that? Nothing but this?—yes, as much love in rhyme
As would be crammed up in a sheet of paper
Writ o’ both sides the leaf, margin and all,
That he was fain to seal on Cupid’s name.
