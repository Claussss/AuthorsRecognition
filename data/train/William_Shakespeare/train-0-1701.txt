Here, Tamora, though gripped with killing grief. Where is thy brother Bassianus? Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound.
Poor Bassianus here lies murdered. Then all too late I bring this fatal writ,
The complot of this timeless tragedy,
And wonder greatly that manâ€™s face can fold
In pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny.
