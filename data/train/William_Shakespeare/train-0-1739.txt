What dost thou strike at, Marcus, with thy knife? At that that I have killed, my lord—a fly. Out on thee, murderer! Thou kill’st my heart.
Mine eyes are cloyed with view of tyranny.
A deed of death done on the innocent
Becomes not Titus’ brother. Get thee gone.
I see thou art not for my company. Alas, my lord, I have but killed a fly.
