This was well done, my bird. Thy shape invisible retain thou still.
The trumpery in my house, go bring it hither
For stale to catch these thieves. I go, I go. A devil, a born devil, on whose nature
Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains,
Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost,
And, as with age his body uglier grows,
So his mind cankers. I will plague them all,
Even to roaring.
