LORD BARDOLPH Noble Earl, I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury. NORTHUMBERLAND Good, an God will. LORD BARDOLPH As good as heart can wish. The King is almost wounded to the death;
And, in the fortune of my lord your son,
Prince Harry slain outright; and both the Blunts
Killed by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John
And Westmorland and Stafford fled the field;
And Harry Monmouth’s brawn, the hulk Sir John,
Is prisoner to your son. O, such a day,
So fought, so followed, and so fairly won,
Came not till now to dignify the times
Since Caesar’s fortunes!
