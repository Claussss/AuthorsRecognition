Cease, no more! You smell this business with a sense as cold
As is a dead man’s nose. But I do see’t and feel’t
As you feel doing thus; and see withal
The instruments that feel. If it be so, We need no grave to bury honesty;
There’s not a grain of it the face to sweeten
Of the whole dungy earth. What? Lack I credit?
