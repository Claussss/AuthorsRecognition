KING EDWARD Why, then, thou shalt not have thy husband’s lands. Why, then, mine honesty shall be my dower;
For by that loss I will not purchase them. KING EDWARD Therein thou wrong’st thy children mightily. Herein your highness wrongs both them and me.
But, mighty lord, this merry inclination
Accords not with the sadness of my suit.
Please you dismiss me either with ay or no.
