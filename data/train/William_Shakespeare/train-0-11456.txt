MIRANDA (aside) Why speaks my father so ungently? This
Is the third man that e’er I saw, the first
That e’er I sighed for. Pity move my father
To be inclined my way. O, if a virgin, And your affection not gone forth, I’ll make you
The Queen of Naples. Soft, sir! One word more. (Aside) They are both in either’s powers. But this swift
business
I must uneasy make, lest too light winning
Make the prize light. (To Ferdinand) One word more. I
charge thee
That thou attend me. Thou dost here usurp
The name thou ow’st not; and hast put thyself
Upon this island as a spy, to win it
From me the lord on’t.
