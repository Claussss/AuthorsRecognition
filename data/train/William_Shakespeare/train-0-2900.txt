DROMIO OF EPHESUS Here’s too much ‘Out upon thee!’ I pray thee, let me in. DROMIO or SYRACUSE (within the Phoenix) Ay, when fowls have no feathers, and fish have no fin. ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Well, I’ll break in.—Go borrow me a crow. DROMIO OF EPHESUS A crow without feather? Master, mean you so?
For a fish without a fin, there’s a fowl without a feather.
(To Dromio of Syracuse)
If a crow help us in, sirrah, we’ll pluck a crow together.
