EDGAR Shall I hear from you anon? EDMOND I do serve you in this business. A credulous father, and a brother noble,
Whose nature is so far from doing harms
That he suspects none; on whose foolish honesty
My practices ride easy. I see the business.
Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit.
All with meâ€™s meet that I can fashion fit.
