He knows the game; how true he keeps the wind! RICHARD OF GLOUCESTER (aside to George) Silence. KING EDWARD (to Lady Gray) Widow, we will consider of your suit;
And come some other time to know our mind. Right gracious lord, I cannot brook delay.
May it please your highness to resolve me now,
And what your pleasure is shall satisfy me.
