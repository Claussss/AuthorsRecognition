KING HENRY (to Gloucester) Uncle, what shall we say to this in law? This doom, my lord, if I may judge by case:
Let Somerset be regent o’er the French,
Because in York this breeds suspicion.
(Indicating Horner and Peter)
And let these have a day appointed them
For single combat in convenient place,
For he (indicating Horner) hath witness of his servant’s
malice.
This is the law, and this Duke Humphrey’s doom.
