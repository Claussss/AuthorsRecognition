Enter Benvolio O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio is dead!
That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
Which too untimely here did scorn the earth. This day’s black fate on more days doth depend.
This but begins the woe others must end. Enter Tybalt Here comes the furious Tybalt back again. He gad in triumph, and Mercutio slain ?
Away to heaven, respective lenity,
And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now.
Now, Tybalt, take the ‘villain’ back again
That late thou gav’st me, for Mercutio’s soul
Is but a little way above our heads,
Staying for thine to keep him company.
Either thou, or I, or both must go with him.
