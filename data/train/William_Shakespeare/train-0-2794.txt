PRINCE PHILIPPE Pluck out your eyes and see not this dayâ€™s shame!
An arm hath beat an army. One poor David
Hath, with a stone, foiled twenty stout Goliaths.
Some twenty naked starvelings with small flints
Hath driven back a puissant host of men
Arrayed and fenced in all accomplements. KING OF FRANCE
