Enter Lord Stanley Earl of Derby Let me but meet you ladies one hour hence,
And I’ll salute your grace of York as mother
And reverend looker-on of two fair queens.
(To Anne) Come, madam, you must straight to
Westminster,
There to be crowned Richard’s royal queen. QUEEN ELIZABETH Ah, cut my lace asunder, that my pent heart
May have some scope to beat, or else I swoon
With this dead-killing news.
