OLD ATHENIAN Most noble lord, Pawn me to this your honour, she is his. My hand to thee; mine honour on my promise. Humbly I thank your lordship. Never may
That state or fortune fall into my keeping
Which is not owed to you. Exeunt Lucilius and Old Athenian POET (presenting a poem to Timon) Vouchsafe my labour, and long live your lordship!
