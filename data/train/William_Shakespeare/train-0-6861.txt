But who?
Lips do not move,
No man must know.’ ‘No man must know.’ What follows? The numbers altered. ‘No man must know.’ If this should be thee, Malvolio? SIR TOBY Marry, hang thee, brock. ‘I may command where I adore,
But silence like a Lucrece knife
With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore.
M.O.A.I. doth sway my life.’
