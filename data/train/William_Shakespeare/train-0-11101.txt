Thou shouldst have made him As little as a crow, or less, ere left
To after-eye him. Madam, so I did. I would have broke mine eye-strings, cracked them,
but
To look upon him till the diminution
Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle;
Nay, followed him till he had melted from
The smallness of a gnat to air, and then
Have turned mine eye and wept. But, good Pisanio,
When shall we hear from him?
