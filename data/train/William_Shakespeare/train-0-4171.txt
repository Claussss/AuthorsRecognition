Is there no remedy? HUBERT None but to lose your eyes. 90 O God, that there were but a mote in yours,
A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,
Any annoyance in that precious sense,
Then, feeling what small things are boisterous there,
Your vile intent must needs seem horrible. 95 Is this your promise? Go to, hold your tongue!
