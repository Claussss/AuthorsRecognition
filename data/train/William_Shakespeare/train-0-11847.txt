I am most joyful, madam, such good dreams
Possess your fancy. Bid the music leave. They are harsh and heavy to me. Music ceases PATIENCE (to Griffith) Do you note How much her grace is altered on the sudden?
How long her face is drawn? How pale she looks,
And of an earthy colour? Mark her eyes? She is going, wench. Pray, pray.
