BASTARD (aside) Drawn in the flattering table of her eye, 505
Hanged in the frowning wrinkle of her brow,
And quartered in her heart: he doth espy
Himself loveâ€™s traitor. This is pity now,
That hanged and drawn and quartered there should be
In such a love so vile a lout as he. 510 BLANCHE (to Louis the Dauphin)
