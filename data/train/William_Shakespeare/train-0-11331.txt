FIRST JAILER You shall not now be stol’n. You have locks upon you,
So graze as you find pasture. SECOND JAILER Ay, or a stomach. Exeunt Jailers Most welcome, bondage, for thou art a way,
I think, to liberty. Yet am I better
Than one that’s sick o‘th’ gout, since he had rather
Groan so in perpetuity than be cured
By th’ sure physician, death, who is the key
T’unbar these locks. My conscience, thou art fettered
More than my shanks and wrists. You good gods give
me
The penitent instrument to pick that bolt,
Then free for ever. Is’t enough I am sorry?
So children temporal fathers do appease;
Gods are more full of mercy. Must I repent,
I cannot do it better than in gyves
Desired more than constrained. To satisfy,
If of my freedom ‘tis the main part, take no
No stricter render of me than my all.
I know you are more clement than vile men
Who of their broken debtors take a third,
A sixth, a tenth, letting them thrive again
On their abatement. That’s not my desire.
For Innogen’s dear life take mine, and though
’Tis not so dear, yet ‘tis a life; you coined it.
’Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp;
Though light, take pieces for the figure’s sake;
You rather mine, being yours. And so, great powers,
If you will make this audit, take this life,
And cancel these cold bonds. O Innogen,
I’ll speak to thee in silence!
