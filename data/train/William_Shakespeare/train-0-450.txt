GREMIO Why will you mew her up, Signor Baptista, for this fiend of hell,
And make her bear the penance of her tongue? Gentlemen, content ye. I am resolved.
Go in, Bianca. Exit Bianca And for I know she taketh most delight
In music, instruments, and poetry,
Schoolmasters will I keep within my house
Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,
Or, Signor Gremio, you know any such,
Prefer them hither; for to cunning men
I will be very kind, and liberal
To mine own children in good bringing up.
And so farewell. Katherina, you may stay,
For I have more to commune with Bianca.
