You’re out of breath, And this high-speeded pace is but to say
That you shall never, like the maid Flavina,
Love any that’s called man. EMILIA I am sure I shall not. Now alack, weak sister, I must no more believe thee in this point—
Though in’t I know thou dost believe thyself—
Than I will trust a sickly appetite
That loathes even as it longs. But sure, my sister,
If I were ripe for your persuasion, you
Have said enough to shake me from the arm
Of the all-noble Theseus, for whose fortunes
I will now in and kneel, with great assurance
That we more than his Pirithous possess
The high throne in his heart.
