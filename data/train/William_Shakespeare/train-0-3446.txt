GARDENER Hold thy peace. He that hath suffered this disordered spring
Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf.
The weeds which his broad spreading leaves did
shelter,
That seemed in eating him to hold him up,
Are plucked up, root and all, by Bolingbrokeâ€”
I mean the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green.
