SEBASTIAN Why, how now, Stefano? STEFANO O, touch me not! I am not Stefano, but a cramp. PROSPERO You’d be king o’the isle, sirrah? STEFANO I should have been a sore one, then. ALONSO (pointing to Caliban) This is a strange thing as e’er I looked on. He is as disproportioned in his manners
As in his shape. (To Caliban) Go, sirrah, to my cell.
Take with you your companions. As you look
To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.
