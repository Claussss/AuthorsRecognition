Enter Lartius, with his power, from the pursuit LARTIUS O general, Here is the steed, we the caparison.
Hadst thou beheld— Pray now, no more. My mother, Who has a charter to extol her blood,
When she does praise me grieves me. I have done
As you have done, that’s what I can; induced
As you have been, that’s for my country.
He that has but effected his good will
Hath overta’en mine act.
