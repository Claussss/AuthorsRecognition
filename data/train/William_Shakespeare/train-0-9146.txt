Thunder. Third Apparition: a child crowned, with a
tree in his hand What is this That rises like the issue of a king,
And wears upon his baby-brow the round
And top of sovereignty? ALL THE WITCHES Listen, but speak not toâ€™t. THIRD APPARITION Be lion-mettled, proud, and take no care
Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are.
Macbeth shall never vanquished be until
Great Birnam Wood to high Dunsinane Hill
Shall come against him.
