SHALLOW What trade art thou, Feeble? FEEBLE A woman’s tailor, sir. SHALLOW Shall I prick him, sir? SIR JOHN You may, but if he had been a man’s tailor, he’d ha’ pricked you. (To Feeble) Wilt thou make as many holes in an enemy’s battle as thou hast done in a woman’s petticoat? FEEBLE I will do my good will, sir; you can have no more.
