There’s something in’t More than my father’s skill, which was the great’st
Of his profession, that his good receipt
Shall for my legacy be sanctified
By th’ luckiest stars in heaven, and would your
honour
But give me leave to try success, I’d venture
The well-lost life of mine on his grace’s cure
By such a day, an hour.
