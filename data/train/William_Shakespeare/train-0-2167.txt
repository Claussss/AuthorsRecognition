Ratcliffe, reward him for the blow I gave him.—
Hath any well-advis
Reward to him that brings the traitor in? THIRD MESSENGER Such proclamation hath been made, my lord. Enter another Messenger FOURTH MESSENGER Sir Thomas Lovell and Lord Marquis Dorset—
‘Tis said, my liege—in Yorkshire are in arms.
But this good comfort bring I to your highness:
The Breton navy is dispersed by tempest.
Richmond in Dorsetshire sent out a boat
Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks
If they were his assistants, yea or no?
Who answered him they came from Buckingham
Upon his party. He, mistrusting them,
Hoist sail and made his course again for Bretagne.
