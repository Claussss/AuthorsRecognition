Is this the Lord Talbot, uncle Gloucester,
That hath so long been resident in France? Yes, if it please your majesty, my liege. KING HENRY (to Talbot) Welcome, brave captain and victorious lord.
When I was young—as yet I am not old—
I do remember how my father said
A stouter champion never handled sword.
Long since we were resolv
Your faithful service and your toil in war,
Yet never have you tasted our reward,
Or been reguerdoned with so much as thanks,
Because till now we never saw your face.
Therefore stand up,
