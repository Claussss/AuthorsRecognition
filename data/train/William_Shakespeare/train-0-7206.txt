PANDARUS Here? What should he do here? Come, he is here, my lord. Do not deny him.
It doth import him much to speak with me. PANDARUS Is he here, say you? It’s more than I know, I’ll be sworn. For my own part, I came in late. What should he do here? Whoa! Nay, then. Come, come, you’ll do him wrong
Ere you are ware. You’ll be so true to him
To be false to him. Do not you know of him,
But yet go fetch him hither. Go. Exit Pandarus
