KING HARRY Know’st thou Gower? FLUELLEN He is my dear friend, an’t please you. KING HARRY Pray thee, go seek him and bring him to my tent. 165 FLUELLEN I will fetch him. Exit My lord of Warwick and my brother Gloucester,
Follow Fluellen closely at the heels.
The glove which I have given him for a favour
May haply purchase him a box o’th’ ear.
It is the soldier’s. I by bargain should
Wear it myself. Follow, good cousin Warwick.
If that the soldier strike him, as I judge
By his blunt bearing he will keep his word,
Some sudden mischief may arise of it,
For I do know Fluellen valiant
And touched with choler, hot as gunpowder,
And quickly will return an injury.
Follow, and see there be no harm between them.
Go you with me, uncle of Exeter.
