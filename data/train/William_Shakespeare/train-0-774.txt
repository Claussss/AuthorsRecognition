QUEEN MARGARET (to Simpcox) Tell me, good fellow, cam’st thou here by chance,
Or of devotion to this holy shrine? God knows, of pure devotion, being called
A hundred times and oftener, in my sleep,
By good Saint Alban, who said, ‘Simon, come;
Come offer at my shrine and I will help thee.’ SIMPCOX’S WIFE
