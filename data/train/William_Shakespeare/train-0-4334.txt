Signor Bassanio. BASSANIO Graziano. I have a suit to you. BASSANIO You have obtained it. You must not deny me. I must go with you to Belmont. Why then, you must. But hear thee, Graziano,
Thou art too wild, too rude and bold of voice-
Parts that become thee happily enough,
And in such eyes as ours appear not faults;
But where thou art not known, why, there they show
Something too liberal. Pray thee, take pain
To allay with some cold drops of modesty
Thy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behaviour
I be misconstered in the place I go to, 180
And lose my hopes.
