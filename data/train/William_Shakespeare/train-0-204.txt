So by your circumstance you call me fool. So by your circumstance I fear you’ll prove. ‘Tis love you cavil at. I am not love. Love is your master, for he masters you,
And he that is so yoked by a fool
Methinks should not be chronicled for wise. Yet writers say ‘As in the sweetest bud
The eating canker dwells, so doting love
Inhabits in the finest wits of all.’
