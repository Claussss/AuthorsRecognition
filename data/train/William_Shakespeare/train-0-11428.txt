Heavens thank you for’t. And now I pray you, sir—
For still ’tis beating in my mind—your reason
For raising this sea-storm. Know thus far forth. By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,
Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies
Brought to this shore; and by my prescience
I find my zenith doth depend upon
A most auspicious star, whose influence
If now I court not, but omit, my fortunes
Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions.
Thou art inclined to sleep; ’tis a good dullness,
And give it way. I know thou canst not choose.
