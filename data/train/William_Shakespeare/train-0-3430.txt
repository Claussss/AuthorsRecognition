See, see, King Richard doth himself appear,
As doth the blushing discontented sun
From out the fiery portal of the east
When he perceives the envious clouds are bent
To dim his glory and to stain the track
Of his bright passage to the occident. Yet looks he like a king. Behold, his eye,
As bright as is the eagleâ€™s, lightens forth
Controlling majesty. Alack, alack for woe
That any harm should stain so fair a show!
