Were our tears wanting to this funeral,
These tidings would call forth her flowing tides. Me they concern; Regent I am of France.
Give me my steeled coat. Iâ€™ll fight for France.
Away with these disgraceful wailing robes! He removes his mourning robe Wounds will I lend the French, instead of eyes,
To weep their intermissive miseries.
