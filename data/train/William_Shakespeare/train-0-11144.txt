My lord, I fear, Has forgot Britain. And himself. Not I Inclined to this intelligence pronounce
The beggary of his change, but ’tis your graces
That from my mutest conscience to my tongue
Charms this report out. Let me hear no more. O dearest soul, your cause doth strike my heart
With pity that doth make me sick. A lady
So fair, and fastened to an empery
Would make the great’st king double, to be partnered
With tomboys hired with that self exhibition
Which your own coffers yield; with diseased ventures
That play with all infirmities for gold
Which rottenness can lend to nature; such boiled stuff
As well might poison poison! Be revenged,
Or she that bore you was no queen, and you
Recoil from your great stock.
