TITUS’ SERVANT (to Flavius) Do you hear, sir? VARRO’S SECOND SERVANT (to Flavius) By your leave, sir. FLAVIUS What do ye ask of me, my friend? TITUS’ SERVANT We wait for certain money here, sir. FLAVIUS Ay, If money were as certain as your waiting,
‘Twere sure enough.
Why then preferred you not your sums and bills
When your false masters ate of my lord’s meat?
Then they could smile and fawn upon his debts,
And take down th’int’est into their glutt’nous maws.
You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up.
Let me pass quietly.
Believe’, my lord and I have made an end.
I have no more to reckon, he to spend.
