Sir, most heedfully. Being once perfected how to grant suits,
How to deny them, who t‘advance and who
To trash for over-topping, new created
The creatures that were mine, I say—or changed ’em
Or else new formed ’em; having both the key
Of officer and office, set all hearts i’th’ state
To what tune pleased his ear, that now he was
The ivy which had hid my princely trunk
And sucked my verdure out on’t. Thou attend’st not!
