HOST Tell him, Cavaliero Justice, tell him, bully rook. SHALLOW Sir, there is a fray to be fought between Sir Hugh, the Welsh priest, and Caius, the French doctor. FORD Good mine Host o’th’ Garter, a word with you. HOST What sayst thou, my bully rook? They talk apart SHALLOW (to Page) Will you go with us to behold it? My merry Host hath had the measuring of their weapons, and, I think, hath appointed them contrary places. For, believe me, I hear the parson is no jester. Hark, I will tell you what our sport shall be.
