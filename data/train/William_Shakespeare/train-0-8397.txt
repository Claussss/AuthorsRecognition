Exit Emilia (Aside) This is the night
That either makes me or fordoes me quite. Exeunt 5.2
Enter Othello with a light. He draws back a curtain, revealingDesdemona asleep in her bed It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul.
Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars.
It is the cause. Yet I’ll not shed her blood,
Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,
And smooth as monumental alabaster.
Yet she must die, else she’ll betray more men.
Put out the light, and then put out the light.
If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,
I can again thy former light restore
Should I repent me; but once put out thy light,
Thou cunning‘st pattern of excelling nature,
I know not where is that Promethean heat
That can thy light relume. When I have plucked thy
rose
I cannot give it vital growth again.
It needs must wither. I’ll smell thee on the tree.
