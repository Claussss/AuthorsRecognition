SERVANT I will, my lord. Enter Calpurnia What mean you, Caesar? Think you to walk forth?
You shall not stir out of your house today. Caesar shall forth. The things that threatened me
Neâ€™er looked but on my back; when they shall see
The face of Caesar, they are vanished. Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies,
Yet now they fright me. There is one within,
Besides the things that we have heard and seen,
Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.
A lioness hath whelp
And graves have yawned and yielded up their dead.
Fierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds,
In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,
Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol.
The noise of battle hurtled in the air.
Horses do neigh, and dying men did groan,
And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.
O Caesar, these things are beyond all use,
And I do fear them.
