Belike you slew great number of his people. Th’offence is not of such a bloody nature,
Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel
Might well have given us bloody argument.
It might have since been answered in repaying
What we took from them, which for traffic’s sake
Most of our city did. Only myself stood out,
For which if I be latched in this place
I shall pay dear.
