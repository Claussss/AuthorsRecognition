Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour
Of many worthy fellows that were out,
Which was to my belief witnessed the rather
For that I saw the tyrantâ€™s power afoot.
Now is the time of help. (To Malcolm) Your eye in
Scotland Would create soldiers, make our women fight
To doff their dire distresses.
