If he did see his face, why then, I know
He thought to kiss him, and hath killed him so. “Tis true, ’tis true; thus was Adonis slain;
He ran upon the boar with his sharp spear,
Who did not whet his teeth at him again,
But by a kiss thought to persuade him there, And, nuzzling in his flank, the loving swine
Sheathed unaware the tusk in his soft groin.
