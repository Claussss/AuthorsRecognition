He is not emulous, as Achilles is. Know the whole world he is as valiant— AJAX A whoreson dog, that shall palter thus with us—would he were a Trojan! What a vice were it in Ajax now— If he were proud— DIOMEDES Or covetous of praise— Ay, or surly borne— DIOMEDES Or strange, or self-affected. ULYSSES (to Ajax)
