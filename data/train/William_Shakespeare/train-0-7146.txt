For O love’s bow
Shoots buck and doe.
The shaft confounds
Not that it wounds, But tickles still the sore.
These lovers cry ‘O! O!’, they die.
Yet that which seems the wound to kill
Doth turn ‘O! O!’ to ‘ha ha he!’
So dying love lives still.
‘O! O!’ a while, but ‘ha ha ha!’
‘O! O!’ groans out for ‘ha ha ha!’—
