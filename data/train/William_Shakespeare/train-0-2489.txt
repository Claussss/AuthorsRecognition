‘The crow may bathe his coal-black wings in mire
And unperceived fly with the filth away,
But if the like the snow-white swan desire,
The stain upon his silver down will stay.
Poor grooms are sightless night, kings glorious day. Gnats are unnoted wheresoe’er they fly,
But eagles gazed upon with every eye.
