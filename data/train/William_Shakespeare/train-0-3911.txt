TITANIA (awaking) What angel wakes me from my flow’ry bed? BOTTOM (sings) The finch, the sparrow, and the lark,
The plainsong cuckoo grey,
Whose note full many a man doth mark,
And dares not answer ‘Nay’— for indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish a bird?
Who would give a bird the lie, though he cry ’Cuckoo’
never so?
