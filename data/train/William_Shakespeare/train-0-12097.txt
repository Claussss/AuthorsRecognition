SECOND FRIEND Alas, what pity it is! I made in to her: She saw me and straight sought the flood—I saved
her,
And set her safe to land, when presently
She slipped away and to the city made,
With such a cry and swiftness that, believe me,
She left me far behind her. Three or four
I saw from far off cross her—one of ’em
I knew to be your brother, where she stayed
And fell, scarce to be got away. I left them with her,
