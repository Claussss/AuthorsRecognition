If so you’ll not o’errule me to a peace. KING CLAUDIUS To thine own peace. If he be now returned,
As checking at his voyage, and that he means
No more to undertake it, I will work him
To an exploit, now ripe in my device,
Under the which he shall not choose but fall;
And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe;
But even his mother shall uncharge the practice
And call it accident. Some two months since
Here was a gentleman of Normandy.
I’ve seen myself, and served against, the French,
And they can well on horseback; but this gallant
Had witchcraft in’t. He grew into his seat,
And to such wondrous doing brought his horse
As had he been incorpsed and demi-natured
With the brave beast. So far he passed my thought
That I in forgery of shapes and tricks
Come short of what he did.
