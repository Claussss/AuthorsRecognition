When, silly groom, God wot, it was defect
Of spirit, life, and bold audacity.
Such harmless creatures have a true respect
To talk in deeds, while others saucily
Promise more speed, but do it leisurely. Even so this pattern of the worn-out age
Pawned honest looks, but laid no words to gage. His kindled duty kindled her mistrust,
That two red fires in both their faces blazed.
She thought he blushed as knowing Tarquinâ€™s lust,
And blushing with him, wistly on him gazed.
Her earnest eye did make him more amazed.
