It was two ere I left him, and now the clock strikes one. The hours come back! That did I never hear. DROMIO OF SYRACUSE O yes, if any hour meet a sergeant, a turns back for very fear. As if time were in debt. How fondly dost thou reason! DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Time is a very bankrupt, and owes more than he’s worth to season.
Nay, he’s a thief too. Have you not heard men say
That time comes stealing on by night and day?
If a be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way,
Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day?
