Cheerly, bold man. Thy soul is all too proud
To yield her city for one little breach. Should be divorced from her earthly spouse
By the soft temper of a Frenchman’s sword.
Lo, to repair thy life I give to thee
Three thousand marks a year in English land. I take thy gift to pay the debts I owe.
These two poor squires redeemed me from the French
With lusty and dear hazard of their lives.
What thou hast given me, I give to them,
And as thou lov’st me, Prince, lay thy consent
To this bequeath in my last testament.
