Sound a sennet The King is coming. Enter one bearing a coronet, then King Lear, then the Dukes of Albany and Cornwall; next Gonoril, Regan, Cordelia, with followers Attend my lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester. GLOUCESTER I shall, my liege. Meantime we will express our darker purposes.
The map there. Know we have divided
In three our kingdom, and ’tis our first intent
To shake all cares and business off our state,
Confirming them on younger years.
The two great princes, France and Burgundy—
Great rivals in our youngest daughter’s love—
Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,
And here are to be answered. Tell me, my daughters,
Which of you shall we say doth love us most,
That we our largest bounty may extend
Where merit doth most challenge it?
Gonoril, our eldest born, speak first.
