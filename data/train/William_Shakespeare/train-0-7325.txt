Exeunt marching 5.11
Enter Aeneas, Paris, Antenor, and Deiphobus Stand, ho! Yet are we masters of the field.
Never go home; here starve we out the night. Enter Troilus Hector is slain. ALL THE OTHERS Hector? The gods forbid. He’s dead, and at the murderer’s horse’s tail
In beastly sort dragged through the shameful field.
Frown on, you heavens; effect your rage with speed;
Sit, gods, upon your thrones, and smite at Troy.
I say, at once: let your brief plagues be mercy,
And linger not our sure destructions on.
