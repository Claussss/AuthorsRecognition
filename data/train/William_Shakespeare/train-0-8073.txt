And punish them even to your height of pleasure.—
Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman
Compact with her that’s gone, think‘st thou thy oaths,
Though they would swear down each particular saint,
Were testimonies against his worth and credit
That’s sealed in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,
Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains
To find out this abuse, whence ’tis derived.
There is another friar that set them on.
Let him be sent for.
