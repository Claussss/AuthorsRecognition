Masquers, guests, gentlewomen, followers of the Montague and Capulet factions 
 The Most Excellent and Lamentable Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet 
Prologue Enter Chorus Two households, both alike in dignity
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life,
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
Doth with their death bury their parents’ strife.
The fearful passage of their death-marked love
And the continuance of their parents’ rage—
Which but their children’s end, naught could remove—
Is now the two-hours’ traffic of our stage;
The which if you with patient ears attend,
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
