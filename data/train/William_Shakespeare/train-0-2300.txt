‘Thou hadst been gone,’ quoth she, ‘sweet boy, ere
this,
But that thou told’st me thou wouldst hunt the boar.
O, be advised; thou know’st not what it is
With javelin’s point a churlish swine to gore, Whose tushes, never sheathed, he whetteth still,
Like to a mortal butcher, bent to kill. ‘On his bow-back he hath a battle set
Of bristly pikes that ever threat his foes.
His eyes like glow-worms shine; when he doth fret
His snout digs sepulchres where’er he goes.
