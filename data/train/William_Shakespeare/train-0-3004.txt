ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS I never came within these abbey walls,
Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me.
I never saw the chain, so help me heaven,
And this is false you burden me withal. Why, what an intricate impeach is this!
I think you all have drunk of Circeâ€™s cup.
If here you housed him, here he would have been.
If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly.
(To Adriana) You say he dined at home, the goldsmith here
Denies that saying. (To Dromio) Sirrah, what say you?
