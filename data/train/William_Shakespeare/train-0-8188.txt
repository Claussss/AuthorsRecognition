DESDEMONA Alas, she has no speech! IAGO In faith, too much. I find it still when I ha’ leave to sleep.
Marry, before your ladyship, I grant,
She puts her tongue a little in her heart,
And chides with thinking. You ha’ little cause to say so. Come on, come on. You are pictures out of door,
Bells in your parlours; wildcats in your kitchens,
Saints in your injuries; devils being offended,
Players in your housewifery, and hussies in your beds.
