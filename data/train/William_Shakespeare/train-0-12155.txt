PIRITHOUS (to Theseus) Sir, my good lord,
 Your sister will no further. O she must.
 She shall see deeds of honour in their kind,
Which sometime show well pencilled. Nature now
Shall make and act the story, the belief
Both sealed with eye and ear. (To Emilia) You must be
present—
You are the victor’s meed, the price and garland
To crown the question’s title.
