NORTHUMBERLAND (to Worcester) Brother, the King hath made your nephew mad. Who struck this heat up after I was gone? He will forsooth have all my prisoners;
And when I urged the ransom once again
Of my wifeâ€™s brother, then his cheek looked pale,
And on my face he turned an eye of death,
Trembling even at the name of Mortimer.
