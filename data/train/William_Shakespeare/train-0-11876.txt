Sure you know me? Yes, my lord, But yet I cannot help you. Enter
Doctor Butts, passing over the
stage Your grace must wait till you be called for. BUTTS (aside) This is a piece of malice. I am glad
I came this way so happily. The King
Shall understand it presently. CRANMER (aside) ‘Tis Butts, The King’s physician. As he passed along
How earnestly he cast his eyes upon me!
Pray heaven he found not my disgrace. For certain

To quench mine honour. They would shame to make me
Wait else at door, a fellow Councillor,
’Mong boys, grooms, and lackeys. But their pleasures
Must be fulfilled, and I attend with patience.
