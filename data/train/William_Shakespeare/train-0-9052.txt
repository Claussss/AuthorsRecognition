Bring forth men-children only, For thy undaunted mettle should compose
Nothing but males. Will it not be received,
When we have marked with blood those sleepy two
Of his own chamber and used their very daggers,
That they have doneâ€™t? LADY MACBETH Who dares receive it other, As we shall make our griefs and clamour roar
Upon his death?
