Sweet Oxford, and my loving Montague,
And all at once, once more a happy farewell. Farewell, sweet lords—let’s meet at Coventry. Exeunt severally! 4.10 Erenter King Henry and the Duke of Exeter Here at the palace will I rest a while.
Cousin of Exeter, what thinks your lordship?
Methinks the power that Edward hath in field
Should not be able to encounter mine.
