They are, my liege, but with a cheerful cry
Hot hounds and hardy chase them at the heels. Enter the Countess of Salisbury below KING EDWARD This is the Countess, Warwick, is it not? EARL OF WARWICK Even she, my liege, whose beauty tyrants’ fear—
As a May blossom with pernicious winds—
Hath sullied, withered, overcast and done.
