You drew your sword upon me without cause,
But I bespake you fair, and hurt you not. Enter Sir Toby and Feste, the clown SIR ANDREW If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt you have hurt me. I think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb. Here comes Sir Toby, halting. You shall hear more; but if he had not been in drink he would have tickled you othergates than he did.
