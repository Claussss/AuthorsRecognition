So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,
Ere I will yield my virgin patent up
Unto his lordship whose unwish
My soul consents not to give sovereignty. Take time to pause, and by the next new moon—
The sealing day betwixt my love and me
For everlasting bond of fetlowship—
Upon that day either prepare to die
For disobedience to your father’s will,
Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would,
Or on Diana’s altar to protest
For aye austerity and single life.
