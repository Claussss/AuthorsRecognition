THESEUS Thou hast well described him. Yet a great deal short,
 Methinks, of him that’s first with Palamon. Pray speak him, friend. I guess he is a prince too,
 And, if it may be, greater—for his show
Has all the ornament of honour in’t.
He’s somewhat bigger than the knight he spoke of,
But of a face far sweeter. His complexion
Is as a ripe grape, ruddy. He has felt,
Without doubt, what he fights for, and so apter
To make this cause his own. In’s face appears
All the fair hopes of what he undertakes,
And when he’s angry, then a settled valour,
Not tainted with extremes, runs through his body
And guides his arm to brave things. Fear he cannot—
He shows no such soft temper. His head’s yellow,
Hard-haired and curled, thick twined: like ivy tods,
Not to undo with thunder. In his face
The livery of the warlike maid appears,
Pure red and white—for yet no beard has blessed
him—
And in his rolling eyes sits victory,
As if she ever meant to court his valour.
His nose stands high, a character of honour;
His red lips, after fights, are fit for ladies.
