Seignieur, no. TALBOT Seignieur, hang! Base muleteers of France, Like peasant footboys do they keep the walls And dare not take up arms like gentlemen. Away, captains, letâ€™s get us from the walls,
For Talbot means no goodness by his looks.
Goodbye, my lord. We came but to tell you
That we are here. Exeunt French from the walls
