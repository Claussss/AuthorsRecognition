BUCKINGHAM (to King Henry) Heâ€™ll wrest the sense, and hold us here all day.
Lord Cardinal, he is your prisoner. CARDINAL BEAUFORT (to some of his attendants) Sirs, take away the Duke and guard him sure. Ah, thus King Henry throws away his crutch
Before his legs be firm to bear his body.
Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side,
And wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first.
Ah, that my fear were false; ah, that it were!
For, good King Henry, thy decay I fear.
