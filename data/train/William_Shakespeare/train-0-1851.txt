RICHARD GLOUCESTER Why, this it is when men are ruled by women.
‘Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower;
My Lady Gray, his wife—Clarence, ’tis she
That tempts him to this harsh extremity.
Was it not she, and that good man of worship
Anthony Woodeville her brother there,
That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,
From whence this present day he is delivered?
We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.
