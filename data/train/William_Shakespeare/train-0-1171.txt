LADY GRAY (to King Edward) Why stops my lord? Shall I not hear my task? KING EDWARD An easy task—’tis but to love a king. That’s soon performed, because I am a subject. KING EDWARD Why, then, thy husband’s lands I freely give thee. 55 LADY GRAY (curtsies) I take my leave, with many thousand thanks. RICHARD OF GLOUCESTER (to George)
