HAMLET Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after. Exit running, pursued by the others 4.3
Enter King Claudius 
KING CLAUDIUS I have sent to seek him, and to find the body.
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
Yet must not we put the strong law on him.
He’s loved of the distracted multitude,
Who like not in their judgement but their eyes,
And where ‘tis so, th’offender’s scourge is weighed,
But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
This sudden sending him away must seem
Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown
By desperate appliance are relieved,
Or not at all.
