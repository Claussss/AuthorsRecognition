5.1
Enter Leontes, Cleomenes, Dion, and Paulina 
CLEOMENES (to Leontes) Sir, you have done enough, and have performed
A saint-like sorrow. No fault could you make
Which you have not redeemed, indeed, paid down
More penitence than done trespass. At the last
Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil.
With them, forgive yourself.
