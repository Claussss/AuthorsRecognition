But cloudy Lucrece shames herself to see,
And therefore still in night would cloistered be. Revealing day through every cranny spies,
And seems to point her out where she sits weeping;
To whom she sobbing speaks, ‘O eye of eyes,
Why pry’st thou through my window? Leave thy
peeping,
Mock with thy tickling beams eyes that are sleeping,
