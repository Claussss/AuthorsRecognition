A better head her glorious body fits
Than his that shakes for age and feebleness.
What should I don this robe and trouble you?—
Be chosen with proclamations today,
Tomorrow yield up rule, resign my life,
And set abroad new business for you all.
Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,
And led my country’s strength successfully,
And buried one-and-twenty valiant sons
Knighted in field, slain manfully in arms
In right and service of their noble country.
