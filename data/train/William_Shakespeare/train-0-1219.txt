GEORGE OF CLARENCE Or else you would not have bestowed the heir
Of the Lord Bonville on your new wifeâ€™s son,
And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere. KING EDWARD Alas, poor Clarence, is it for a wife
That thou art malcontent? I will provide thee. GEORGE OF CLARENCE In choosing for yourself you showed your judgement,
Which being shallow, you shall give me leave
To play the broker in mine own behalf,
And to that end I shortly mind to leave you.
