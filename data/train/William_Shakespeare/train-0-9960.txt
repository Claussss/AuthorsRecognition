PERICLES I am at your grace’s pleasure. KING SIMONIDES Princes, it is too late to talk of love,
And that’s the mark I know you level at.
Therefore each one betake him to his rest;
Tomorrow all for speeding do their best. Exeunt severally 
Sc. 8
Enter Helicanus and Aeschines No, Aeschines, know this of me:
Antiochus from incest lived not free,
For which the most high gods, not minding longer
To hold the vengeance that they had in store
Due to this heinous capital offence,
Even in the height and pride of all his glory,
When he was seated in a chariot
Of an inestimable value, and
His daughter with him, both apparelled all in jewels,
A fire from heaven came and shrivelled up
Their bodies e’en to loathing, for they so stunk
That all those eyes adored them ere their fall
Scorn now their hands should give them burial.
