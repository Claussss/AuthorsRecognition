More kneels Rise up Sir Thomas More. He knights More MORE rising I thank his highness for thus honouring me. This is but first taste of his princely favour,
For it hath pleased his high majesty,
Noting your wisdom and deserving merit,
To put this staff of honour in your hand,
For he hath chose you of his Privy Council.
