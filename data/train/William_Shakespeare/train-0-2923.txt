Even just the sum that I do owe to you
Is growing to me by Antipholus,
And in the instant that I met with you
He had of me a chain. At five o’clock
I shall receive the money for the same.
Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house,
I will discharge my bond, and thank you too. Enter Antipholus of Ephesus and Dromio of Ephesus from the Courtesan’s house (the Porcupine)
