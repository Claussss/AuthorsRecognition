KING EDWARD You cavil, widow-I did mean my queen. ’Twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father. KING EDWARD No more than when my daughters call thee mother.
Thou art a widow and thou hast some children;
And, by God’s mother, I, being but a bachelor,
Have other some. Why, ’tis a happy thing
To be the father unto many sons.
Answer no more, for thou shalt be my queen.
