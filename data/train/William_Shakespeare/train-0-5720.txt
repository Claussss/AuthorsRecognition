KING CHARLES For us, we will consider of this further.
Tomorrow shall you bear our full intent
Back to our brother England. DAUPHIN For the Dauphin, I stand here for him. What to him from England? Scorn and defiance, slight regard, contempt;
And anything that may not misbecome
The mighty sender, doth he prize you at.
Thus says my king: an if your father’s highness
Do not, in grant of all demands at large,
Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty,
He’ll call you to so hot an answer for it
That caves and womby vaultages of France
Shall chide your trespass and return your mock
In second accent of his ordinance.
