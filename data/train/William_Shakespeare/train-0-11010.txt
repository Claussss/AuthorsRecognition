EDGAR ’Chill pick your teeth, sir. Come, no matter vor your foins. Edgar knocks him down Slave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take my purse.
If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body,
And give the letters which thou find’st about me
To Edmond, Earl of Gloucester. Seek him out
Upon the English party. O untimely death! Death!
