OLD ATHENIAN One only daughter have I, no kin else
On whom I may confer what I have got.
The maid is fair, o’th’ youngest for a bride,
And I have bred her at my dearest cost
In qualities of the best. This man of thine
Attempts her love. I prithee, noble lord,
Join with me to forbid him her resort.
Myself have spoke in vain.
