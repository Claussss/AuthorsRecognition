Like an unpractised swimmer plunging still,
With too much labour drowns for want of skill. So she, deep drenched in a sea of care,
Holds disputation with each thing she views,
And to herself all sorrow doth compare;
No object but her passionâ€™s strength renews,
And as one shifts, another straight ensues.
