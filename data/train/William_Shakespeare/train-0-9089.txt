MACBETH Ride you this afternoon? BANQUO Ay, my good lord. We should have else desired your good advice,
Which still hath been both grave and prosperous,
In this day’s council; but we’ll talk tomorrow.
Is’t far you ride? As far, my lord, as will fill up the time
’Twixt this and supper. Go not my horse the better,
I must become a borrower of the night
For a dark hour or twain.
