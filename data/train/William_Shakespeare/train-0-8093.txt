O my dear lord, I crave no other, nor no better man. Never crave him; we are definitive. Gentle my liege— You do but lose your labour.— Away with him to death. (To Lucio) Now, sir, to you. MARIANA (kneeling) O my good lord!—Sweet Isabel, take my part;
Lend me your knees, and all my life to come
I’ll lend you all my life to do you service.
