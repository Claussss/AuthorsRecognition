Look thou be true. Do not give dalliance
Too much the rein. The strongest oaths are straw
To th’ fire i’th’ blood. Be more abstemious,
Or else, good night your vow. I warrant you, sir, The white cold virgin snow upon my heart
Abates the ardour of my liver. Now come, my Ariel! Bring a corollary
Rather than want a spirit. Appear, and pertly.
