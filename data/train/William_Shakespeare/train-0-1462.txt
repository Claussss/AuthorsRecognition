countrymen, This token serveth for a flag of truce
Betwixt ourselves and all our followers.
So help me God, as I dissemble not. So help me God (aside) as I intend it not. O loving uncle, kind Duke of Gloucester,
How joyful am I made by this contract!
(To Servingmen) Away, my masters, trouble us no
more,
But join in friendship as your lords have done.
