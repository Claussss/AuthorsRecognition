Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee. I would I had your bond, for I perceive
A weak bond holds you. I’ll not trust your word. What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?
Although I hate her, I’ll not harm her so. What, can you do me greater harm than hate?
Hate me—wherefore O me, what news, my love?
Am not I Hermia? Are not you Lysander?
I am as fair now as I was erewhile.
Since night you loved me, yet since night you left me.
Why then, you left me—O, the gods forbid—
In earnest, shall I say?
