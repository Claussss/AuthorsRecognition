So it should be, That none but Antony should conquer Antony.
But woe ’tis so! I am dying, Egypt, dying. Only
I here importune death awhile until
Of many thousand kisses the poor last
I lay upon thy lips. I dare not, dear, Dear, my lord, pardon. I dare not,
Lest I be taken. Nor th’imperious show
Of the full-fortuned Caesar ever shall
Be brooched with me, if knife, drugs, serpents, have
Edge, sting, or operation. I am safe.
Your wife, Octavia, with her modest eyes
And still conclusion, shall acquire no honour
Demuring upon me. But come, come, Antony.—
Help me, my women.—We must draw thee up.
Assist, good friends.
