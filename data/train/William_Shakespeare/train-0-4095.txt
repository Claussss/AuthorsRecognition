KING PHILIP Let it be so.-Say, where will you assault? We from the west will send destruction
Into this city’s bosom. AUSTRIA I from the north. KING PHILIP Our thunder from the south Shall rain their drift of bullets on this town. BASTARD to King John O prudent discipline! From north to south
Austria and France shoot in each other’s mouth.
I’ll stir them to it. Come, away, away!
