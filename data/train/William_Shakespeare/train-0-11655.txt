Still exaction! The nature of it? In what kind, let’s know,
Is this exaction? QUEEN KATHERINE I am much too venturous In tempting of your patience, but am boldened
Under your promised pardon. The subjects’ grief
Comes through commissions which compels from each
The sixth part of his substance to be levied
Without delay, and the pretence for this
Is named your wars in France. This makes bold mouths.
Tongues spit their duties out, and cold hearts freeze
Allegiance in them. Their curses now
Live where their prayers did, and it’s come to pass
This tractable obedience is a slave
To each incensed will. I would your highness
Would give it quick consideration, for
There is no primer business.
