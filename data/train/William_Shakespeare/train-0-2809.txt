QUEEN PHILIPPA A Ah, be more mild unto these yielding men!
It is a glorious thing to stablish peace,
And kings approach the nearest unto God
By giving life and safety unto men.
As thou intendest to be king of France,
So let her people live to call thee king.
For what the sword cuts down, or fire hath spoiled,
Is held in reputation none of ours.
