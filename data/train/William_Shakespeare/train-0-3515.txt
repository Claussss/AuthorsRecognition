Thou frantic woman, what dost thou make here?
Shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear? DUCHESS OF YORK
Sweet York, be patient.â€”Hear me, gentle liege. Rise up, good aunt. DUCHESS OF YORK Not yet, I thee beseech. Forever will I kneel upon my knees,
And never see day that the happy sees,
Till thou give joy, until thou bid me joy
By pardoning Rutland, my transgressing boy.
