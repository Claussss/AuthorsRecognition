LORD HASTINGS His grace looks cheerfully and smooth this morning.
There’s some conceit or other likes him well,
When that he bids good morrow with such spirit.
I think there’s never a man in Christendom
Can lesser hide his love or hate than he,
For by his face straight shall you know his heart. What of his heart perceive you in his face
By any likelihood he showed today?
