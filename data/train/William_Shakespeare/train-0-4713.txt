SIR JOHN What, is the King encamped? WESTMORLAND He is, Sir John. I fear we shall stay too long. Exit Well, to the latter end of a fray
And the beginning of a feast
Fits a dull fighter and a keen guest. Exit 4.3
Enter Hotspur, the Earls of Worcester and Douglas, and Sir Richard Vernon Weâ€™ll fight with him tonight.
