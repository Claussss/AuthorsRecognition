KING OF FRANCE Edward, recount not things irrevocable.
Tell me what ransom thou requir’st to have. KING EDWARD Thy ransom, Jean, hereafter shall be known.
But first to England thou must cross the seas
To see what entertainment it affords.
Howe’er it falls, it cannot be so bad
As ours hath been since we arrived in France.
