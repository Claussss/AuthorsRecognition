MARINA Well, I will go, But truly I have no desire to it. Nay, I know ’tis good for you. Walk half an hour,
Leonine, at the least; remember
What I have said. LEONINE I warr’nt you, madam. DIONYZA (to Marina) I’ll leave you, my sweet lady, for a while.
Pray you walk softly, do not heat your blood.
What, I must have care of you!
