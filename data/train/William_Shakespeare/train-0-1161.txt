FIRST GAMEKEEPER We are true subjects to the King, King Edward. So would you be again to Henry,
If he were seated as King Edward is. FIRST GAMEKEEPER We charge you, in God’s name and in the King’s,
To go with us unto the officers. In God’s name, lead; your king’s name be obeyed;
And what God will, that let your king perform;
And what he will I humbly yield unto. Exeunt
