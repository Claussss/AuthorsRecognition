BARTHOLOMEW Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me,
Being all this time abandoned from your bed. Tis much. Servants, leave me and her alone. Exeunt [Lord and] attendants Madam, undress you and come now to bed. BARTHOLOMEW Thrice-noble lord, let me entreat of you
To pardon me yet for a night or two,
Or if not so, until the sun be set,
For your physicians have expressly charged,
In peril to incur your former malady,
That I should yet absent me from your bed.
I hope this reason stands for my excuse.
