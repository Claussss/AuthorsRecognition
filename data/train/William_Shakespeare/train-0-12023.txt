Enter Palamon as out of a bush with his shackles. He bends his fist at Arcite Traitor kinsman, Thou shouldst perceive my passion if these signs
Of prisonment were off me, and this hand
But owner of a sword. By all oaths in one,

That e’er bore gentle token, falsest cousin
That ever blood made kin—call’st thou her thine?

Void of appointment, that thou liest and art
A very thief in love, a chaffy lord
Not worth the name of villain. Had I as word
And these house-clogs away—
