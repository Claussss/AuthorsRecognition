All the whole synod of them! What’s thy passion? The greater cantle of the world is lost
With very ignorance; we have kissed away
Kingdoms and provinces. How appears the fight? On our side like the tokened pestilence,
Where death is sure. Yon riband-red nag of Egypt—
Whom leprosy o‘ertake!-i’th’ midst o’th’ fight—
When vantage like a pair of twins appeared,
Both as the same, or rather ours the elder—
The breese upon her, like a cow in June,
Hoists sails and flies.
