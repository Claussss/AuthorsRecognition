CAESAR (to Pompey) Since I saw you last There is a change upon you. Well, I know not What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face,
But in my bosom shall she never come
To make my heart her vassal. Well met here. I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed.
I crave our composition may be written
And sealed between us.
