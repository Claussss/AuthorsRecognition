Last longer telling than thy kindness’ date. KING RICHARD Then know that, from my soul, I love thy daughter. QUEEN ELIZABETH My daughter’s mother thinks that with her soul. KING RICHARD What do you think? QUEEN ELIZABETH That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul;

And from my heart’s love I do thank thee for it.
