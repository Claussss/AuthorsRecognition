BARDOLPH Here’s Mistress Quickly, sir, to speak with you. SIR JOHN Come, let me pour in some sack to the Thames’ water, for my belly’s as cold as if I had swallowed snowballs for pills to cool the reins. Call her in. BARDOLPH Come in, woman! Enter Mistress Quickly MISTRESS QUICKLY (to Sir John) By your leave; I cry you mercy. Give your worship good morrow!
