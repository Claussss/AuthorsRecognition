Alack, thou dost usurp authority. KING PHILIP Excuse it is to beat usurping down. QUEEN ELEANOR Who is it thou dost call usurper, France? 120 Let me make answer: thy usurping son. QUEEN ELEANOR Out, insolent! Thy bastard shall be king
That thou mayst be a queen and check the world. My bed was ever to thy son as true
As thine was to thy husband; and this boy 125
Liker in feature to his father Geoffrey
Than thou and John in manners, being as like
As rain to water, or devil to his dam.
My boy a bastard? By my soul I think
His father never was so true begot. 130
It cannot be, an if thou wert his mother.
