Enter Lucentio with books, as Cambio, Hortensio with a lute, as Licio, and Bianca Fiddler, forbear. You grow too forward, sir.
Have you so soon forgot the entertainment
Her sister Katherine welcomed you withal? But, wrangling pedant, this Bianca is,
The patroness of heavenly harmony.
Then give me leave to have prerogative,
And when in music we have spent an hour
Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.
