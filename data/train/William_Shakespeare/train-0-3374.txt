It may be so, but yet my inward soul
Persuades me it is otherwise. Howe’er it be,
I cannot but be sad: so heavy-sad
As thought—on thinking on no thought I think—
Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink. ’Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady. ‘Tis nothing less: conceit is still derived
From some forefather grief; mine is not so;
For nothing hath begot my something grief—
Or something hath the nothing that I grieve—
’Tis in reversion that I do possess—
But what it is that is not yet known what,
I cannot name; ’tis nameless woe, I wot.
