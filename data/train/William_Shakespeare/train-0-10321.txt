O, sir, sir, sir, I would have had you put your power well on
Before you had worn it out. You might have been enough the man you are
With striving less to be so. Lesser had been
The taxings of your dispositions if
You had not showed them how ye were disposed
Ere they lacked power to cross you. Let them hang.
