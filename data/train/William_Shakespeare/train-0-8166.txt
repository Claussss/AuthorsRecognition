Be it as you shall privately determine,
Either for her stay or going. Th’affair cries haste,
And speed must answer it. A SENATOR (to Othello) You must away tonight. Tonight, my lord? This night. With all my heart. At nine i’th’ morning here we’ll meet again.
Othello, leave some officer behind,
And he shall our commission bring to you,
And such things else of quality and respect
As doth import you.
