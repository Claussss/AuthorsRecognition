4.2
Enter Goneril and Edmond the bastard at one doorand Oswald the steward at another Welcome, my lord. I marvel our mild husband
Not met us on the way. (To Oswald) Now, where’s
your master? Madam, within; but never man so changed.
I told him of the army that was landed;
He smiled at it. I told him you were coming;
His answer was ‘The worse’. Of Gloucester’s treachery
And of the loyal service of his son
When I informed him, then he called me sot,
And told me I had turned the wrong side out.
What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;
What like, offensive.
