HOTSPUR stand I think there’s no man speaketh better Welsh. I’ll to dinner. Peace, cousin Percy, you will make him mad. I can call spirits from the vasty deep. Why, so can I, or so can any man; But will they come when you do call for them? Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command the devil. And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil,
By telling truth: ‘Tell truth, and shame the devil’.
If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,
And I’ll be sworn I have power to shame him hence.
O, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil.
