Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth: Suns of the world may stain when heaven’s sun staineth.
34 Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day
And make me travel forth without my cloak,
To let base clouds o‘ertake me in my way,
Hiding thy brav’ry in their rotten smoke?
‘Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break
To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,
For no man well of such a salve can speak
That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace.
Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;
Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss.
Th’offender’s sorrow lends but weak relief
To him that bears the strong offence’s cross.
