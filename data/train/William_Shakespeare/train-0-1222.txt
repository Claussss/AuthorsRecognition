RICHARD OF GLOUCESTER (aside) I hear, yet say not much, but think the more. Enter the Post from France KING EDWARD Now, messenger, what letters or what news from France ? My sovereign liege, no letters and few words,
But such as I, without your special pardon,
Dare not relate. KING EDWARD Go to, we pardon thee. Therefore, in brief,
Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them.
What answer makes King Louis unto our letters?
