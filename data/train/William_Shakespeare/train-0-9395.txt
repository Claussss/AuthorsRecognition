Enter Enobarbus and Eros, meeting 
ENOBARBUS How now, friend Eros? EROS There’s strange news come, sir. ENOBARBUS What, man? EROS Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey. ENOBARBUS This is old. What is the success? EROS Caesar, having made use of him in the wars ’gainst Pompey, presently denied him rivality, would not let him partake in the glory of the action, and, not resting here, accuses him of letters he had formerly wrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal seizes him; so the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine.
