MARINER I will, my lord. My gracious sovereign, France hath ta‘en the foil,
And boasting Edward triumphs with success.
These iron-hearted navies,
When last I was reporter to your grace,
Both full of angry spleen, of hope and fear,
Hasting to meet each other in the face,
At last conjoined, and by their admiral
Our admiral encountered many shot.
By this, the other, that beheld these twain
Give earnest-penny of a further wreck,
Like fiery dragons took their haughty flight;
And likewise meeting, from their smoky wombs
Sent many grim ambassadors of death.
Then ’gan the day to turn to gloomy night,
And darkness did as well enclose the quick
As those that were but newly reft of life.
No leisure served for friends to bid farewell,
And if it had, the hideous noise was such
As each to other seemed deaf and dumb.
Purple the sea whose channel filled as fast
With streaming gore that from the maimed fell,
As did her gushing moisture break into
The cranny cleftures of the through-shot planks.
Here flew a head dissevered from the trunk;
There mangled arms and legs were tossed aloft,
As when a whirlwind takes the summer dust
And scatters it in middle of the air.
Then might ye see the reeling vessels split
And, tottering, sink into the ruthless flood
Until their lofty tops were seen no more.
All shifts were tried, both for defence and hurt.
And now the effect of valour and of fear,
Of resolution and of cowardice,
We lively pictured—how the one for fame,
The other by compulsion, laid about.
Much did the Nonpareil, that brave ship;
So did the Black Snake of Boulogne, than which
A bonnier vessel never yet spread sail.
But all in vain: both sun, the wind and tide
Revolted all unto our foemen’s side,
That we, perforce, were fain to give them way,
And they are landed. Thus my tale is done.
We have untimely lost, and they have won.
