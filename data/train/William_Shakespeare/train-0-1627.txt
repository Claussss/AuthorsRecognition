Let it be so, and let Andronicus
Make this his latest farewell to their souls. Flourish.Then sound trumpets and lay the coffinsin the tomb In peace and honour rest you here, my sons;
Romeâ€™s readiest champions, repose you here in rest,
Secure from worldly chances and mishaps.
Here lurks no treason, here no envy swells,
Here grow no damned drugs, here are no storms,
No noise, but silence and eternal sleep.
In peace and honour rest you here, my sons.
