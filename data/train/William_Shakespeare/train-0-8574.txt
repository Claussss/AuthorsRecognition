LEAR Ask her forgiveness? Do you mark how this becomes the house?
Kneeling
Age is unnecessary. On my knees I beg
That you’ll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.’ Good sir, no more. These are unsightly tricks.
Return you to my sister. LEAR rising She hath abated me of half my train,
Looked black upon me, struck me with her tongue
Most serpent-like upon the very heart.
All the stored vengeances of heaven fall
On her ungrateful top! Strike her young bones,
You taking airs, with lameness!
