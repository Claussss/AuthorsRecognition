FIRST MURDERER Remember our reward, when the deed’s done. SECOND MURDERER ‘Swounds, he dies. I had forgot the reward. FIRST MURDERER Where’s thy conscience now? SECOND MURDERER’ O, in the Duke of Gloucester’s purse. FIRST MURDERER When he opens his purse to give us our reward, thy conscience flies out.
