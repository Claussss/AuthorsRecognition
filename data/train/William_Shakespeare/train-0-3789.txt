FIRST MUSICIAN An you re us and fa us, you note us. SECOND MUSICIAN Pray you, put up your dagger and put out your wit. Sings
When griping grief the heart doth wound,
And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
Then music with her silver sound— Why ‘silver sound’, why ‘music with her silver sound’?
What say you, Matthew Minikin?
