For all my mind, my thought, my busy care
Is how to get my palfrey from the mare.’ Thus she replies: ‘Thy palfrey, as he should,
Welcomes the warm approach of sweet desire.
Affection is a coal that must be cooled,
Else, suffered, it will set the heart on fire. The sea hath bounds, but deep desire hath none;
Therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone.
