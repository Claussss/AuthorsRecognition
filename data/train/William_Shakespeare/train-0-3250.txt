Enter Holofernes the pedant as Judas, and the boy Mote as Hercules Great Hercules is presented by this imp,
Whose club killed Cerberus, that three-headed
canus,
And when he was a babe, a child, a shrimp,
Thus did he strangle serpents in his manus.
Quoniam he seemeth in minority,
Ergo I come with this apology.
(To Mote) Keep some state in thy exit, and vanish.
