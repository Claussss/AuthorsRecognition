Wherefore, gentle maiden, Do you neglect them? For I have heard it said There is an art which in their piedness shares
With great creating nature. Say there be, Yet nature is made better by no mean
But nature makes that mean. So over that art
Which you say adds to nature is an art
That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry
A gentler scion to the wildest stock,
And make conceive a bark of baser kind
By bud of nobler race. This is an art
Which does mend natureâ€”change it rather; but
The art itself is nature.
