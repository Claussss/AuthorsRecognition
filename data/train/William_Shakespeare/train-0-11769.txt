CARDINAL WOLSEY Madam, you wander from the good we aim at. QUEEN KATHERINE My lord, I dare not make myself so guilty
To give up willingly that noble title
Your master wed me to. Nothing but death
Shall e’er divorce my dignities. CARDINAL WOLSEY Pray, hear me. QUEEN KATHERINE Would I had never trod this English earth,
Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it.
Ye have angels’ faces, but heaven knows your hearts.
What will become of me now, wretched lady?
I am the most unhappy woman living.
(To her women) Alas, poor wenches, where are now
your fortunes?
Shipwrecked upon a kingdom where no pity,
No friends, no hope, no kindred weep for me?
Almost no grave allowed me? Like the lily,
That once was mistress of the field and flourished,
I’ll hang my head and perish.
