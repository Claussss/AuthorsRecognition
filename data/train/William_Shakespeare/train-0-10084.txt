She questionless, with her sweet harmony
And other choice attractions, would alarum
And make a batt‘ry through his deafened ports,
Which now are midway stopped. She in all happy,
As the fair’st of all, among her fellow maids
Dwells now i’th’ leafy shelter that abuts
Against the island’s side. Go fetch her hither.
