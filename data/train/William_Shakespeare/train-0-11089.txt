That mightst have had the sole son of my queen! O blessed that I might not! I chose an eagle
And did avoid a puttock. Thou tookâ€™st a beggar, wouldst have made my throne
A seat for baseness. No, I rather added A lustre to it. O thou vile one! It is your fault that I have loved Posthumus.
You bred him as my playfellow, and he is
A man worth any woman, over-buys me
Almost the sum he pays.
