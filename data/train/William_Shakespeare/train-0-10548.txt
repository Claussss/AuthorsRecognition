I dare be sworn. These dangerous, unsafe lunes i‘th’ King, beshrew
them!
He must be told on’t, and he shall. The office
Becomes a woman best. I’ll take’t upon me.
If I prove honey-mouthed, let my tongue blister,
And never to my red-looked anger be
The trumpet any more. Pray you, Emilia,
Commend my best obedience to the Queen.
If she dares trust me with her little babe
I’ll show’t the King, and undertake to be
Her advocate to th’ loud‘st. We do not know
How he may soften at the sight o’th’ child.
The silence often of pure innocence
Persuades when speaking fails.
