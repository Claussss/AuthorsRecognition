KING HENRY (to the Duchess) Stand forth, Dame Eleanor Cobham, Gloucester’s wife. She comes forward In sight of God and us your guilt is great;
Receive the sentence of the law for sins
Such as by God’s book are adjudged to death.
(To the Witch, Southwell, Hume, and Bolingbroke)
You four, from hence to prison back again;
From thence, unto the place of execution.
The witch in Smithfield shall be burned to ashes,
And you three shall be strangled on the gallows.
