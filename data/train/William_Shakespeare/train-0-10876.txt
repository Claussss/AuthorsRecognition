None of these rogues and cowards But Ajax is their fool. Fetch forth the stocks! Exeunt some servants You stubborn, ancient knave, you reverend braggart,
Weâ€™ll teach you. Sir, I am too old to learn. Call not your stocks for me. I serve the King,
On whose employment I was sent to you.
You shall do small respect, show too bold malice
Against the grace and person of my master,
Stocking his messenger.
