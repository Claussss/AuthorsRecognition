Yes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond. Then meet me forthwith at the notary’s.
Give him direction for this merry bond,
And I will go and purse the ducats straight,
See to my house—left in the fearful guard
Of an unthrifty knave—and presently
I’ll be with you. ANTONIO Hie thee, gentle Jew. Exit Shylock
