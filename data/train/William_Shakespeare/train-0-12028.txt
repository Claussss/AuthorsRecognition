O, you heavens, dares any So noble bear a guilty business! None
But only Arcite, therefore none but Arcite
In this kind is so bold. ARCITE Sweet Palamon. I do embrace you and your offer—for
Your offer do’t I only, sir; your person,
Without hypocrisy, I may not wish Wind horns within  More than my sword’s edge on’t.
