Disorder that hath spoiled us, friend us now,
Let us on heaps go offer up our lives. We are enough yet living in the field
To smother up the English in our throngs,
If any order might be thought upon. The devil take order now. Iâ€™ll to the throng.
Let life be short, else shame will be too long. Exeunt
B. QUARTO
