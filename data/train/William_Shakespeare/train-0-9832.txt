Admiringly, my liege. At first 45
I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart
Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue;
Where, the impression of mine eye enfixing,
Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,
Which warped the line of every other favour,
Stained a fair colour or expressed it stolen,
Extended or contracted all proportions
To a most hideous object. Thence it came
That she whom all men praised and whom myself,
Since I have lost, have loved, was in mine eye 55
The dust that did offend it.
