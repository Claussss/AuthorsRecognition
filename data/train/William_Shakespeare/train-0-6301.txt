ROSALIND (to Celia) O come, let us remove. The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.
(To Corin) Bring us to this sight, and you shall say
I’ll prove a busy actor in their play.  3.5
Enter Silvius and Phoebe Sweet Phoebe, do not scorn me, do not, Phoebe.
Say that you love me not, but say not so
In bitterness. The common executioner,
Whose heart th’accustomed sight of death makes
hard,
Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
But first begs pardon. Will you sterner be
Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?
