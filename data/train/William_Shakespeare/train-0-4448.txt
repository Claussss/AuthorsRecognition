Most heartily I do beseech the court
To give the judgement. PORTIA Why, then thus it is: You must prepare your bosom for his knife— O noble judge, O excellent young man! For the intent and purpose of the law
Hath full relation to the penalty
Which here appeareth due upon the bond. ’Tis very true. O wise and upright judge!
