LADY MACBETH Almost at odds with morning, which is which. How sayst thou that Macduff denies his person
At our great bidding? LADY MACBETH Did you send to him, sir? I hear it by the way, but I will send.
There’s not a one of them but in his house
I keep a servant fee’d. I will tomorrow,
And betimes I will, to the weird sisters.
More shall they speak, for now I am bent to know
By the worst means the worst. For mine own good
All causes shall give way. I am in blood
Stepped in so far that, should I wade no more,
Returning were as tedious as go o’er.
Strange things I have in head that will to hand,
Which must be acted ere they may be scanned.
