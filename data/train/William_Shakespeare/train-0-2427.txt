This moves in him more rage and lesser pity
To make the breach and enter this sweet city. First like a trumpet doth his tongue begin
To sound a parley to his heartless foe,
Who oâ€™er the white sheet peers her whiter chin,
The reason of this rash alarm to know,
Which he by dumb demeanour seeks to show.
