RICHARD GLOUCESTER The curse my noble father laid on thee—
When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper,
And with thy scorns drew‘st rivers from his eyes,
And then, to dry them, gav’st the duke a clout
Steeped in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland—
His curses then, from bitterness of soul
Denounced against thee, are all fall’n upon thee,
And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed.
