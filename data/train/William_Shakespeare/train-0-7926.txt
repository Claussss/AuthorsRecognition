PROVOST As I do think, tomorrow. (To Juliet) I have provided for you. Stay a while,
And you shall be conducted. Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry? I do, and bear the shame most patiently. Iâ€™ll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,
And try your penitence if it be sound
Or hollowly put on.
