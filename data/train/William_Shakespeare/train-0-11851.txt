O, my good lord, that comfort comes too late,
â€™Tis like a pardon after execution.
That gentle physic, given in time, had cured me;
But now I am past all comforts here but prayers.
How does his highness? Madam, in good health. So may he ever do, and ever flourish
When I shall dwell with worms, and my poor name
Banished the kingdom. (To her woman) Patience, is
that letter
I caused you write yet sent away?
