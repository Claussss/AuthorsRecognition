ADDITIONAL PASSAGES Q gives this more expansive version of Marina’s Epitaph (18.347): ’The fairest, sweetest, best lies here,
Who withered in her spring of year.
She was of Tyrus the King’s daughter,
On whom foul death hath made this slaughter.
 Marina was she called, and at her birth
 Thetis, being proud, swallowed some part o‘th’ earth;
 Therefore the earth, fearing to be o’erflowed,
 Hath Thetis’ birth-child on the heav‘ns bestowed,
 Wherefore she does, and swears she’ll never stint,
 Make raging batt’ry upon shores of flint.’
