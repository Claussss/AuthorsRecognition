BURGUNDY aside I am vanquished. These haughty words of hers
Have battered me like roaring cannon-shot
And made me almost yield upon my knees.
(To the others) Forgive me, country, and sweet
countrymen;
And lords, accept this hearty kind embrace.
My forces and my power of men are yours.
So farewell, Talbot. Iâ€™ll no longer trust thee.
