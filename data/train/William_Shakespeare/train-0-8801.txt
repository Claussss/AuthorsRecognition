APEMANTUS No, I will do nothing at thy bidding. Make thy requests to thy friend. SECOND LORD Away, unpeaceable dog, or I’ll spurn thee hence. APEMANTUS I will fly, like a dog, the heels o’th’ ass. He’s opposite to humanity. Come, shall we in,
And taste Lord Timon’s bounty? He outgoes
The very heart of kindness.
