Enter the Nurse and Peter  O God, she comes! O honey Nurse, what news?
Hast thou met with him ? Send thy man away. NURSE Peter, stay at the gate. Exit Peter Now, good sweet Nurse—O Lord, why look‘st thou sad ?
Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
If good, thou sham’st the music of sweet news
By playing it to me with so sour a face.
