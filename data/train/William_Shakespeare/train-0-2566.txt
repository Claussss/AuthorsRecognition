‘For in the dreadful dead of dark midnight
With shining falchion in my chamber came

And softly cried, “Awake, thou Roman dame,
And entertain my love; else lasting shame On thee and thine this night I will inflict,
If thou my love’s desire do contradict. ‘“For some hard-favoured groom of thine,” quoth he,
“Unless thou yoke thy liking to my will,
I’ll murder straight, and then I’ll slaughter thee,
And swear I found you where you did fulfil
The loathsome act of lust, and so did kill
