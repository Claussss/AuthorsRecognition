Exit Artesius (To Hippolyta) Since that our theme is haste,
I stamp this kiss upon thy current lip—
Sweet, keep it as my token. (To the wedding party) Set
you forward,
For I will see you gone.
(To Emilia) Farewell, my beauteous sister.—Pirithous,
Keep the feast full: bate not an hour on’t. I’ll follow you at heels. The feast’s solemnity
Shall want till your return.
