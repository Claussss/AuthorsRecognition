SIR TOBY What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight? SIR ANDREW Faith, I can cut a caper. SIR TOBY And I can cut the mutton to’t. SIR ANDREW And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong as any man in Illyria. SIR TOBY Wherefore are these things hid? Wherefore have these gifts a curtain before ’em? Are they like to take dust, like Mistress Mall’s picture? Why dost thou not go to church in a galliard, and come home in a coranto? My very walk should be a jig. I would not so much as make water but in a cinquepace. What dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in? I did think by the excellent constitution of thy leg it was formed under the star of a galliard.
