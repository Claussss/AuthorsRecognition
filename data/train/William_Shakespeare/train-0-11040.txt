Sir, by your patience, I hold you but a subject of this war,
Not as a brother. Thatâ€™s as we list to grace him. Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded
Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers,
Bore the commission of my place and person,
The which immediacy may well stand up
And call itself your brother.
