Letâ€™s with our colours sweet the air of France. Enter Lodowick LODOWICK (to the King) My liege, the Countess, with a smiling cheer,
Desires access unto your majesty. KING EDWARD (aside) Why there it goes. That very smile of hers
Hath ransomed captive France and set the King,
The Dauphin and the peers at liberty.
(To the Prince) Go, leave me, Ned, and revel with thy friends.
