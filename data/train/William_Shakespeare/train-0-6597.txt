QUEEN GERTRUDE To draw apart the body he hath killed,
O’er whom—his very madness, like some ore
Among a mineral of metals base,
Shows itself pure—a weeps for what is done. KING CLAUDIUS O Gertrude, come away!
The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
But we will ship him hence; and this vile deed
We must with all our majesty and skill
Both countenance and excuse.—Ho, Guildensternl
