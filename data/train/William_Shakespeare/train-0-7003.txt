OLIVIA (to Viola) A sister, you are she. Enter Malvolio Is this the madman? OLIVIA Ay, my lord, this same. How now, Malvolio? MALVOLIO Madam, you have done me wrong, Notorious wrong. OLIVIA Have I, Malvolio? No. MALVOLIO (showing a letter) Lady, you have. Pray you peruse that letter.
You must not now deny it is your hand.
Write from it if you can, in hand or phrase,
Or say ‘tis not your seal, not your invention.
You can say none of this. Well, grant it then,
And tell me in the modesty of honour
Why you have given me such clear lights of favour,
Bade me come smiling and cross-gartered to you,
To put on yellow stockings, and to frown
Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people,
And acting this in an obedient hope,
Why have you suffered me to be imprisoned,
Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,
And made the most notorious geck and gull
That e’er invention played on? Tell me why?
