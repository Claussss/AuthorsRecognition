[He rises and joins the players] MORE as GOOD COUNSEL O good Master Wit, thou art now on the bow hand,
And blindly in thine own opinion dost stand.
I tell thee, this naughty lewd Inclination
Does lead thee amiss in a very strange fashion.
This is not Wisdom, but Lady Vanity.
Therefore list to Good Counsel, and be ruled by me.
