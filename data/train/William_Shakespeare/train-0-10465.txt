Drums and trumpets sound, with great shouts of the people FIRST CONSPIRATOR Your native town you entered like a post,
And had no welcomes home; but he returns
Splitting the air with noise. SECOND CONSPIRATOR And patient fools, Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear
With giving him glory.
