CARDINAL WOLSEY Madam, you wrong the King’s love with these fears.
Your hopes and friends are infinite. QUEEN KATHERINE But little for my profit. Can you think, lords,
That any Englishman dare give me counsel,
Or be a known friend ’gainst his highness’ pleasure—
Though he be grown so desperate to be honest—
And live a subject? Nay, forsooth, my friends,
They that must weigh out my afflictions,
They that my trust must grow to, live not here.
They are, as all my other comforts, far hence,
In mine own country, lords.
