SHEPHERD (to the English) ‘Tis true I gave a noble to the priest
The morn that I was wedded to her mother.
(To Joan) Kneel down, and take my blessing, good my
girl.
Wilt thou not stoop? Now cursed be the time
Of thy nativity. I would the milk
Thy mother gave thee when thou sucked’st her breast
Had been a little ratsbane for thy sake.
Or else, when thou didst keep my lambs afield,
I wish some ravenous wolf had eaten thee.
Dost thou deny thy father, cursed drab?
(To the English) O burn her, burn her! Hanging is too
good. Exit
