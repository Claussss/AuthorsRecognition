The strawberry grows underneath the nettle,
And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best
Neighboured by fruit of baser quality;
And so the Prince obscured his contemplation
Under the veil of wildnessâ€”which, no doubt,
Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,
Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty. It must be so, for miracles are ceased,
And therefore we must needs admit the means
How things are perfected.
