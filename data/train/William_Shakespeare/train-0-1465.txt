RICHARD PLANTAGENET Thy humble servant vows obedience
And humble service till the point of death. Stoop then, and set your knee against my foot. Richard kneels And in reguerdon of that duty done,
I gird thee with the valiant sword of York.
Rise, Richard, like a true Plantagenet,
And rise created princely Duke of York.
