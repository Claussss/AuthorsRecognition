With surety stronger than Achillesâ€™ arm,
Fore all the Greekish heads, which with one voice
Call Agamemnon heart and general. Fair leave and large security. How may
A stranger to those most imperial looks
Know them from eyes of other mortals? AGAMEMNON How? Ay, I ask that I might waken reverence
And on the cheek be ready with a blush
Modest as morning when she coldly eyes
The youthful Phoebus.
Which is that god in office, guiding men?
Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon?
