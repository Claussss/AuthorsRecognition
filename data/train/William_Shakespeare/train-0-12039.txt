By heaven and earth,
 There’s nothing in thee honest. Then I’ll leave you—
 You are a beast now. PALAMON As thou mak’st me, traitor. ARCITE (pointing to the bundle) There’s all things needful: files and shirts and
perfumes—
I’ll come again some two hours hence and bring
That that shall quiet all. PALAMON A sword and armour.
