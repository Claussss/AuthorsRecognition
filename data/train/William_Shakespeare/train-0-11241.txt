Can her contempt be answered? Please you, sir, Her chambers are all locked, and there’s no answer
That will be given to th’ loud’st of noise we make. My lord, when last I went to visit her
She prayed me to excuse her keeping close,
Whereto constrained by her infirmity,
She should that duty leave unpaid to you
Which daily she was bound to proffer. This
She wished me to make known, but our great
court
Made me to blame in memory.
