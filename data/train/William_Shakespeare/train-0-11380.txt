Why, old soldier, Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for
By tasting of our wrath? How of descent
As good as we? In that he spake too far. CYMBELINE to Belarius And thou shalt die for’t. We will die all three But I will prove that two on ’s are as good
As I have given out him. My sons, I must
For mine own part unfold a dangerous speech,
Though haply well for you.
