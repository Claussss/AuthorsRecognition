VIOLA Whatâ€™s she? A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count
That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her
In the protection of his son, her brother,
Who shortly also died, for whose dear love,
They say, she hath abjured the sight
And company of men. O that I served that lady,
And might not be delivered to the world
Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,
What my estate is.
