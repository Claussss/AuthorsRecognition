ALBANY Even so.—Cover their faces. I pant for life. Some good I mean to do,
Despite of my own nature. Quickly send,
Be brief in’t, to th’ castle; for my writ
Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia.
Nay, send in time. ALBANY Run, run, O run! To who, my lord? Who hath the office? Send
Thy token of reprieve.
