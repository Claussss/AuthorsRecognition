What concern they— The general cause, or is it a fee-grief
Due to some single breast? No mind that’s honest But in it shares some woe, though the main part
Pertains to you alone. If it be mine, Keep it not from me; quickly let me have it. Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,
Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
That ever yet they heard.
