The trick of that voice I do well remember.
Is’t not the King? LEAR Ay, every inch a king. Gloucester kneels When I do stare, see how the subject quakes!
I pardon that man’s life. What was thy cause?
Adultery? Thou shalt not die for adultery.
No, the wren goes to‘t, and the small gilded fly
Does lecher in my sight.
Let copulation thrive, for Gloucester’s bastard son
Was kinder to his father than my daughters
Got ’tween the lawful sheets. To‘t, luxury, pell-mell,
For I lack soldiers. Behold yon simp’ring dame,
Whose face between her forks presageth snow,
That minces virtue, and does shake the head
To hear of pleasure’s name:
The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to’t
With a more riotous appetite. Down from the waist
They’re centaurs, though women all above.
But to the girdle do the gods inherit;
Beneath is all the fiend’s. There’s hell, there’s
darkness,
There’s the sulphury pit, burning, scalding,
Stench, consummation. Fie, fie, fie; pah, pah!
Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary,
To sweeten my imagination.
There’s money for thee.
