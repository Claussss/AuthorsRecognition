Enter a Messenger How now, what news? My lord, the rebels have broke open Newgate,
From whence they have delivered many prisoners, zo
Both felons and notorious murderers
That desperately cleave to their lawless train. Up with the drawbridge! Gather some forces
To Cornhill and Cheapside. And, gentlemen,
If diligence be used on every side,
A quiet ebb will follow this rough tide.
