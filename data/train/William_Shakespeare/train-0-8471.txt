FRANCE Come, fair Cordelia. Exeunt France and Cordelia GONORIL Sister, it is not a little I have to say of what most nearly appertains to us both. I think our father will hence tonight. REGAN Thatâ€™s most certain, and with you. Next month with us. GONORIL You see how full of changes his age is. The observation we have made of it hath not been little. He always loved our sister most, and with what poor judgement he hath now cast her off appears too gross.
