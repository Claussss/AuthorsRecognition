Enter King Lear and the Duke of Gloucester Deny to speak with me? They are sick, they are weary,
They have travelled all the night?â€”mere fetches,
The images of revolt and flying off.
Fetch me a better answer. My dear lord, You know the fiery quality of the Duke,
How unremovable and fixed he is
In his own course.
