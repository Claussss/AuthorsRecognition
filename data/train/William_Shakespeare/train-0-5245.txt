SIR JOHN We have heard the chimes at midnight, Master Shallow. SHALLOW That we have, that we have; in faith, Sir John, we have. Our watchword was ‘Hem boys!’ Come, let’s to dinner; come, let’s to dinner. Jesus, the days that we have seen! Come, come. 216 Exeunt Shallow, Silence, and Sir John BULLCALF coming forwardy with my friends. Else, sir, I did not care, for mine own part, so much.
