Break, heart, I prithee break. EDGAR (to Lear) Look up, my lord. Vex not his ghost. O, let him pass. He hates him
That would upon the rack of this tough world
Stretch him out longer. He is gone indeed. The wonder is he hath endured so long.
He but usurped his life. Bear them from hence. Our present business
Is general woe. (To Edgar and Kent) Friends of my
soul, you twain
Rule in this realm, and the gored state sustain.
