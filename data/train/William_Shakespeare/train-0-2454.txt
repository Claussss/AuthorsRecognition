Pure chastity is rifled of her store,
And lust, the thief, far poorer than before. Look as the full-fed hound or gorged hawk,
Unapt for tender smell or speedy flight,
Make slow pursuit, or altogether balk
The prey wherein by nature they delight,
So surfeit-taking Tarquin fares this night. His taste delicious, in digestion souring,
Devours his will that lived by foul devouring.
