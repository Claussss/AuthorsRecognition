I’ll tell thee. (To Gonoril) Life and death! I am
ashamed
That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus,
That these hot tears, that break from me perforce
And should make thee—worst blasts and fogs upon
thee!
Untented woundings of a father’s curse
Pierce every sense about thee! Old fond eyes,
Beweep this cause again I’ll pluck you out
And cast you, with the waters that you make,
To temper clay. Yea,
Is’t come to this? Yet have I left a daughter
Whom, I am sure, is kind and comfortable.
When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails
She’ll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find
That I’ll resume the shape which thou dost think
I have cast off for ever; thou shalt, I warrant thee.
