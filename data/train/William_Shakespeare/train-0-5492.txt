Enter Beatrice Now begin,  For look where Beatrice like a lapwing runs
Close by the ground to hear our conference. The pleasantâ€™st angling is to see the fish
Cut with her golden oars the silver stream
And greedily devour the treacherous bait.
So angle we for Beatrice, who even now
Is couched in the woodbine coverture.
Fear you not my part of the dialogue.
