CYMBELINE (to Innogen) What wouldst thou, boy? I love thee more and more; think more and more
What’s best to ask. Know‘st him thou look’st on?
Speak, no
Wilt have him live? Is he thy kin, thy friend? He is a Roman, no more kin to me
Than I to your highness, who, being born your vassal,
Am something nearer.
