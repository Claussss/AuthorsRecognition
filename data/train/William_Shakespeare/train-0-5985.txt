Thy lover,
 Artemidorus.â€™ Here will I stand till Caesar pass along,
And as a suitor will I give him this.
My heart laments that virtue cannot live
Out of the teeth of emulation.
If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayst live.
If not, the fates with traitors do contrive. Exit  2.4
Enter Portia and Lucius
