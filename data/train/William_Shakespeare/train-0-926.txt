Ay, there’s the question—but I say ’tis true.
The elder of them, being put to nurse,
Was by a beggar-woman stol’n away,
And, ignorant of his birth and parentage,
Became a bricklayer when he came to age.
His son am I—deny it an you can. Nay, ’tis too true—therefore he shall be king. WEAVER Sir, he made a chimney in my father’s house,
and the bricks are alive at this day to testify. Therefore
deny it not.
