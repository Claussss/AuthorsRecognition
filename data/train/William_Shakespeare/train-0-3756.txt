FRIAR LAURENCE My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
My lord, we must entreat the time alone. God shield I should disturb devotion!â€”
Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.
(Kissing her) Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss.
Exit O, shut the door, and when thou hast done so,
Come weep with me, past hope, past cure, past help!
