Her voice to music or the nightingale.
To music every summer-leaping swain
Compares his sunburnt lover when she speaks,
And why should I speak of the nightingale?
The nightingale sings of adulterate wrong
And that compare is too satirical,
For sin, though sin, would not be so esteemed,
But rather virtue sin, sin virtue deemed.
Her hair far softer than the silkworm’s twist,
Like to a flattering glass doth make more fair
The yellow amber—‘like a flattering glass’
Comes in too soon: for writing of her eyes
I’ll say that like a glass they catch the sun,
And thence the hot reflection doth rebound
Against my breast and burns my heart within.
Ah, what a world of descant makes my soul
Upon this voluntary ground of love!
Come, Lod’wick: hast thou turned thy ink to gold?
If not, write but in letters capital
My mistress’ name, and it will gild thy paper.
Read, Lod’wick, read!
Fill thou the empty hollows of mine ears
With the sweet hearing of thy poetry!
