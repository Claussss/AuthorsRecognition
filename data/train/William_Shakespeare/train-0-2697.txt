Exeunt all but the King of France and Prince Philippe Now tell me, Philippe, what is thy conceit
Touching the challenge that the English make? PRINCE PHILIPPE I say, my lord, claim Edward what he can,
And bring he ne‘er so plain a pedigree,
’Tis you are in possession of the crown,
And that’s the surest point of all the law.
But were it not, yet ere he should prevail
I’ll make a conduit of my dearest blood,
Or chase those straggling upstarts home again.
