Your sword is bright, sir; put it up again. Not till I sheathe it in a murderer’s skin. HUBERT (drawing his sword) Stand back, Lord Salisbury, stand back, I say!
By heaven, I think my sword’s as sharp as yours.
I would not have you, lord, forget yourself,
Nor tempt the danger of my true defence,
Lest I, by marking of your rage, forget
Your worth, your greatness and nobility.
