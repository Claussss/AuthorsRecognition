FIRST CITIZEN Why, so hath this, both by his father and mother. THIRD CITIZEN Better it were they all came by his father,
Or by his father there were none at all.
For emulation who shall now be near’st
Will touch us all too near, if God prevent not.
O full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester,
And the Queen’s sons and brothers haught and proud.
And were they to be ruled, and not to rule,
This sickly land might solace as before.
