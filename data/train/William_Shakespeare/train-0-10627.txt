PERDITA (to Polixenes) Sir, welcome. It is my father’s will I should take on me
The hostess-ship o’th’ day.
(To Camillo) You’re welcome, sir.
Give me those flowers there, Dorcas. Reverend sirs,
For you there’s rosemary and rue. These keep
Seeming and savour all the winter long.
Grace and remembrance be to you both,
And welcome to our shearing.
