GOWER Sir John Falstaff. FLUELLEN That is he. I’ll tell you, there is good men porn at Monmouth. GOWER Here comes his majesty. Alarum. Enter King Harry and the English army, with the Duke of Bourbon, the Duke of Orl I was not angry since I came to France
Until this instant. Take a trumpet, herald;
Ride thou unto the horsemen on yon hill.
If they will fight with us, bid them come down,
Or void the field: they do offend our sight.
If they’ll do neither, we will come to them,
And make them skirr away as swift as stones
Enforced from the old Assyrian slings.
Besides, we’ll cut the throats of those we have,
And not a man of them that we shall take
Shall taste our mercy. Go and tell them so.
