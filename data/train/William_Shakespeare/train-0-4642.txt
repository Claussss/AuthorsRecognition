A plague upon it, I have forgot the map! No, here it is. Sit, cousin Percy, sit,
Good cousin Hotspur; Hotspur sits For by that name As oft as Lancaster doth speak of you,
His cheek looks pale, and with a rising sigh
He wisheth you in heaven. HOTSPUR And you in hell, As oft as he hears Owain Glynd I cannot blame him. At my nativity
The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,
Of burning cressets; and at my birth
The frame and huge foundation of the earth
Shaked like a coward.
