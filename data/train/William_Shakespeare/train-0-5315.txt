KING HENRY O my son, God put it in thy mind to take it hence,
That thou mightst win the more thy fatherâ€™s love,
Pleading so wisely in excuse of it!
Come hither, Harry; sit thou by my bed,
And hear, I think, the very latest counsel
That ever I shall breathe. Prince Harry rises from kneeling andsits by the bed
