Juliet awakes and rises  The lady stirs. O comfortable friar, where is my lord?
I do remember well where I should be,
And there I am. Where is my Romeo? 150 FRIAR LAURENCE I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.
A greater power than we can contradict
Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead, 155
And Paris, too. Come, Iâ€™ll dispose of thee
Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.
Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.
Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay. Exit
