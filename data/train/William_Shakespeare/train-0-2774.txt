PRINCE OF WALES Herald of Philippe, greet thy lord from me.
All good that he can send I can receive.
But think’st thou not the unadvised boy
Hath wronged himself in thus far tendering me?
Haply he cannot pray without the book;
I think him no divine extemporal.
Then render back this commonplace of prayer
To do himself good in adversity.
Besides, he knows not my sins’ quality,
And therefore knows no prayers for my avail.
Ere night his prayer may be to pray to God
To put it in my heart to hear his prayer.
So tell the courtly wanton, and be gone.
