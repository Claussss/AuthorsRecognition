We have no reason to enquire it,
Commended to our master, not to us.
Yet ere you shall depart, this we desire:
As friends to Antioch, we may feast in Tyre. Exeunt Sc. 4
Enter Cleon, the Governor of Tarsus, with Dionyza his wife, and others My Dionyza, shall we rest us here
And, by relating tales of others’ griefs,
See if ’twill teach us to forget our own?
