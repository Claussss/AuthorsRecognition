Kind Rome, that hast thus lovingly reserved
The cordial of mine age to glad my heart!
Lavinia, live; outlive thy father’s days
And fame’s eternal date, for virtue’s praise. Lavinia rises MARCUS aloft Long live Lord Titus, my beloved brother,
Gracious triumpher in the eyes of Rome! Thanks, gentle Tribune, noble brother Marcus.
