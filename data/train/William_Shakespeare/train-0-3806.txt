Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,
Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
And in despite I’ll cram thee with more food. PARIS (aside) This is that banished haughty Montague
That murdered my love’s cousin, with which grief
It is supposed the fair creature died;
And here is come to do some villainous shame
To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.
Drawing
Can vengeance be pursued further than death? 55
Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee.
Obey and go with me, for thou must die.
