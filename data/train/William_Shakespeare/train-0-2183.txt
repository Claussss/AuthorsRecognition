Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge.
Use careful watch; choose trusty sentinels. NORFOLK I go, my lord. KING RICHARD Stir with the lark tomorrow, gentle Norfolk. I warrant you, my lord. KING RICHARD KING RICHARD Send out a pursuivant-at-arms
To Stanleyâ€™s regiment. Bid him bring his power
Before sun-rising, lest his son George fall
Into the blind cave of eternal night.
Fill me a bowl of wine. Give me a watch.
Saddle white Surrey for the field tomorrow.
Look that my staves be sound, and not too heavy.
Ratcliffe.
