MORE as GOOD COUNSEL Wit, judge not things by the outward show.
The eye oft mistakes, right well you do know.
Good Counsel assures thee upon his honesty
That this is not Wisdom, but Lady Vanity.
Enter Luggins, with the beard PLAYER of INCLINATION O my lord, he is come. Now we shall go forward. MORE Art thou come? Well, fellow, I have holp to save
thine honesty a little. Now, if thou canst give Wit any
better counsel than I have done, spare not. There I leave
him to thy mercy.
But by this time I am sure our banquet’s ready.
My lord and ladies, we will taste that first,
And then they shall begin the play again,
Which through the fellow’s absence, and by me,
Instead of helping, hath been hindered.
[To Servants] Prepare against we come. Lights there, I
say.—
Thus fools oft-times do help to mar the play.
