Why, knows not Montague that of itself
England is safe, if true within itself? But the safer when ’tis backed with France. ’Tis better using France than trusting France.
Let us be backed with God and with the seas
Which he hath giv’n for fence impregnable,
And with their helps only defend ourselves.
In them and in ourselves our safety lies.
