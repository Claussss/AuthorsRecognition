I would thou hadst done so by Claudio.
Go fetch him hither. Let me look upon him.
Exit Provost I am sorry one so learned and so wise
As you, Lord Angelo, have still appeared,
Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood
And lack of tempered judgement afterward. I am sorry that such sorrow I procure,
And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart
That I crave death more willingly than mercy.
â€™Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.
