Enter Barnardine and the Provost; Claudio, muffled, and Juliet Which is that Barnardine? This, my lord. There was a friar told me of this man.
(To Barnardine) Sirrah, thou art said to have a
stubborn soul
That apprehends no further than this world,
And squar‘st thy life according. Thou’rt condemned;
But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all,
And pray thee take this mercy to provide
For better times to come.—Friar, advise him.
I leave him to your hand. (To Provost) What muffled
fellow’s that?
