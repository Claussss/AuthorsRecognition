About him were a press of gaping faces
Which seemed to swallow up his sound advice,
All jointly listâ€™ning, but with several graces,
As if some mermaid did their ears entice;
Some high, some low, the painter was so nice. The scalps of many, almost hid behind,
To jump up higher seemed, to mock the mind.
