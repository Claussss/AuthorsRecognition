They have all been touched and found base metal,
For they have all denied him. SEMPRONIUS How, have they denied him? Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him,
And does he send to me? Three? Hmhl
It shows but little love or judgement in him.
Must I be his last refuge? His friends, like physicians,
Thrive, give him over; must I take th’ cure upon me?
He’s much disgraced me in’t. I’m angry at him,
That might have known my place. I see no sense for’t
But his occasions might have wooed me first,
For, in my conscience, I was the first man
That e‘er received gift from him.
And does he think so backwardly of me now
That I’ll requite it last? No.
So it may prove an argument of laughter
To th’ rest, and I ’mongst lords be thought a fool.
I’d rather than the worth of thrice the sum
He’d sent to me first, but for my mind’s sake.
I’d such a courage to do him good. But now return,
And with their faint reply this answer join:
Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin.
