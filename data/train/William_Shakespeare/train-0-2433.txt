And in thy dead arms do I mean to place him,
Swearing I slew him seeing thee embrace him. â€˜So thy surviving husband shall remain
The scornful mark of every open eye,
Thy kinsmen hang their heads at this disdain,
Thy issue blurred with nameless bastardy,
And thou, the author of their obloquy, Shalt have thy trespass cited up in rhymes
And sung by children in succeeding times.
