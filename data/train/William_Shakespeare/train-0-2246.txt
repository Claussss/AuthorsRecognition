‘Were I hard-favoured, foul, or wrinkled-old,
Ill-nurtured, crooked, churlish, harsh in voice,
O’er-worn, despised, rheumatic, and cold,
Thick-sighted, barren, lean, and lacking juice, Then mightst thou pause, for then I were not for
thee.
But having no defects, why dost abhor me? ‘Thou canst not see one wrinkle in my brow.
Mine eyes are grey, and bright, and quick in turning.
My beauty as the spring doth yearly grow.
My flesh is soft and plump, my marrow burning.
