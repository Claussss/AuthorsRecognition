His drumming heart cheers up his burning eye,
His eye commends the leading to his hand.
His hand, as proud of such a dignity,
Smoking with pride marched on to make his stand
On her bare breast, the heart of all her land, Whose ranks of blue veins as his hand did scale
Left their round turrets destitute and pale.
