FRIAR LAURENCE Hold, daughter, I do spy a kind of hope
Which craves as desperate an execution
As that is desperate which we would prevent.
If, rather than to marry County Paris,
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
A thing like death to chide away this shame,
That cop‘st with death himself to scape from it;
And, if thou dar’st, I’ll give thee remedy.
