Thou, Leonatus, art the lion’s whelp.
The fit and apt construction of thy name,
Being leo-natus, doth import so much.
(To Cymbeline) The piece of tender air thy virtuous
daughter,
Which we call ‘mollis aer’; and ‘mollis aer’
We term it ‘mulier’, (to Posthumus) which ‘mulier’ I
divine
Is this most constant wife, who even now,
Answering the letter of the oracle,
Unknown to you, unsought, were clipped about
With this most tender air.
