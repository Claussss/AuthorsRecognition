LORD I go, my lord. Exit Welcome is peace, if he on peace consist;
If wars, we are unable to resist. Enter Pericles with attendants PERICLES (to Cleon) Lord Governor, for so we hear you are,
Let not our ships and number of our men
Be like a beacon fixed tâ€™amaze your eyes.
We have heard your miseries as far as Tyre,
Since entering your unshut gates have witnessed
The widowed desolation of your streets;
Nor come we to add sorrow to your hearts,
But to relieve them of their heavy load;
And these our ships, you happily may think
Are like the Trojan horse was fraught within
With bloody veins importing overthrow,
Are stored with corn to make your needy bread,
And give them life whom hunger starved half dead.
