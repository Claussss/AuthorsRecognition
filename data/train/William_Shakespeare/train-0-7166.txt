In that I’ll war with you. O virtuous fight,
When right with right wars who shall be most right.
True swains in love shall in the world to come
Approve their truth by Troilus. When their rhymes,
Full of protest, of oath and big compare,
Wants similes, truth tired with iteration—
‘As true as steel, as plantage to the moon,
As sun to day, as turtle to her mate,
As iron to adamant, as earth to th’ centre’—
Yet, after all comparisons of truth,
As truth’s authentic author to be cited,
’As true as Troilus’ shall crown up the verse
And sanctify the numbers.
