Of the King’s ship, The mariners, say how thou hast disposed,
And all the rest o’th’ fleet. Safely in harbour Is the King’s ship, in the deep nook where cnce
Thou called‘st me up at midnight to fetch dew
From the still-vexed Bermudas, there she’s hid;
The mariners all under hatches stowed,
Who, with a charm joined to their suffered labour,
I have left asleep. And for the rest o’th’ fleet,
Which I dispersed, they all have met again,
And are upon the Mediterranean float
Bound sadly home for Naples,
Supposing that they saw the King’s ship wrecked,
And his great person perish.
