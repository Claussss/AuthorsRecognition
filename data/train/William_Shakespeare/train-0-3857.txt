FLUTE Here, Peter Quince. QUINCE Flute, you must take Thisbe on you. FLUTE What is Thisbe? A wand’ring knight? QUINCE It is the lady that Pyramus must love. FLUTE Nay, faith, let not me play a woman. I have a beard coming. QUINCE That’s all one. You shall play it in a mask, and you may speak as small as you will.
