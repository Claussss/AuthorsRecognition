TROILUS Hear why I speak it, love. The Grecian youths are full of quality,
Their loving well composed, with gifts of nature
flowing,
And swelling o’er with arts and exercise.
How novelty may move, and parts with person,
Alas, a kind of godly jealousy—
Which I beseech you call a virtuous sin—
Makes me afeard.
