Prince Pericles, touch not, upon thy life,
For that’s an article within our law
As dang’rous as the rest. Your time’s expired.
Either expound now, or receive your sentence. PERICLES Great King, Few love to hear the sins they love to act.
‘Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it.
Who has a book of all that monarchs do,
He’s more secure to keep it shut than shown,
For vice repeated, like the wand’ring wind,
Blows dust in others’ eyes to spread itself;
And yet the end of all is bought thus dear,
The breath is gone, and the sore eyes see clear
To stop the air would hurt them. The blind mole casts
Copped hills towards heav’n to tell the earth is thronged
By man’s oppression, and the poor worm doth die for’t.
Kings are earth’s gods; in vice their law’s their will,
And if Jove stray, who dares say Jove doth ill?
It is enough you know, and it is fit,
What being more known grows worse, to smother it.
All love the womb that their first being bred;
Then give my tongue like leave to love my head.
