It may well be There is a mutiny inâ€™s mind. This morning
Papers of state he sent me to peruse
As I required, and wot you what I found
There, on my conscience put unwittingly?
Forsooth, an inventory thus importing
The several parcels of his plate, his treasure,
Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household which
I find at such proud rate that it outspeaks
Possession of a subject.
