Thanks to my lord. The Jove of power make me most weak, most weak,
Your reconciler! Wars â€™twixt you twain would be
As if the world should cleave, and that slain men
Should solder up the rift. When it appears to you where this begins,
Turn your displeasure that way, for our faults
Can never be so equal that your love
Can equally move with them. Provide your going,
Choose your own company, and command what cost
Your heart has mind to.
