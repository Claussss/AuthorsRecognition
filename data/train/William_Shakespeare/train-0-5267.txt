WESTMORLAND (taking the schedule) This will I show the general. Please you, lords,
In sight of both our battles we may meet,
And either end in peace—which God so frame—
Or to the place of diff’rence call the swords
Which must decide it. ARCHBISHOP OF YORK My lord, we will do so. 180 Exit Westmorland
