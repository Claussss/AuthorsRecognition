Enter Master Morris Come, will your lordship in? My dear Erasmus—
I’ll hear you, Master Morris, presently.—
To Erasmus
We’ll banquet here with fresh and staid delights.
The Muses’ music here shall cheer our spirits.
The cates must be but mean where scholars sit;
For they’re made all with courses of neat wit.
