ANTONY How, my love? CLEOPATRA Perchance? Nay, and most like. You must not stay here longer. Your dismission
Is come from Caesar, therefore hear it, Antony.
Where’s Fulvia’s process—Caesar’s, I would say—
both? Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt’s queen,
Thou blushest, Antony, and that blood of thine
Is Caesar’s homager; else so thy cheek pays shame
When shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!
