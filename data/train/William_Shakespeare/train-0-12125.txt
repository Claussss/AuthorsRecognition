Honour crown the worthiest. Exit Theseus and his train PALAMON (to Arcite) The glass is running now that cannot finish
Till one of us expire. Think you but thus,
That were there aught in me which strove to show
Mine enemy in this business, were’t one eye
Against another, arm oppressed by arm,
I would destroy th’offender—coz, I would,
Though parcel of myself. Then from this gather
How I should tender you.
