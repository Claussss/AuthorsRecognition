GLOUCESTER Strong and fastened villain! Would he deny his letter? I never got him. Trumpets within Hark, the Duke’s trumpets. I know not why he comes.
All ports I’ll bar. The villain shall not scape.
The Duke must grant me that; besides, his picture
I will send far and near, that all the kingdom
May have note of him—and of my land,
Loyal and natural boy, I’ll work the means
To make thee capable.
