There was three fools fell out about an owlet— The one he said it was an owl,
The other he said nay,
The third he said it was a hawk,
And her bells were cut away. THIRD COUNTRYMAN There’s a dainty madwoman, master,
Comes i’th’ nick, as mad as a March hare.
If we can get her dance, we are made again.
I warrant her, she’ll do the rarest gambols.
