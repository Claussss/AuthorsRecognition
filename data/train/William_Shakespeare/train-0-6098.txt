Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors’ hands,
Unless thou bring’st them with thee. OCTAVIUS So I hope. I was not born to die on Brutus’ sword. O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,
Young man, thou couldst not die more honourable. A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honour,
Joined with a masquer and a reveller!
