I’ll be your purse-bearer, and leave you
For an hour. To th’ Elephant. I do remember. Exeunt severally  3.4
Enter Olivia and Maria 
OLIVIA (aside) I have sent after him, he says he’ll come.

For youth is bought more oft than begged or
borrowed.
I speak too loud.
(To Maria) Where’s Malvolio? He is sad and civil, 5
And suits well for a servant with my fortunes.
Where is Malvolio?
