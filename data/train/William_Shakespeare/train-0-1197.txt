KING LOUIS (to Lady Boa) Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve. Your grant, or your denial, shall be mine.
(To Warwick) Yet I confess that often ere this day,
When I have heard your king’s desert recounted,
Mine ear hath tempted judgement to desire. KING LOUIS (to Warwick) Then, Warwick, thus—our sister shall be Edward’s.
And now, forthwith, shall articles be drawn
Touching the jointure that your king must make,
Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised.
(To Queen Margaret) Draw near, Queen Margaret, and
be a witness
That Bona shall be wife to the English king.
