‘As burning fevers, agues pale and faint,
Life-poisoning pestilence, and frenzies wood,
The marrow-eating sickness whose attaint
Disorder breeds by heating of the blood; Surfeits, impostumes, grief, and damned despair
Swear nature’s death for framing thee so fair. ‘And not the least of all these maladies
But in one minute’s fight brings beauty under.
Both favour, savour, hue, and qualities,
Whereat th’impartial gazer late did wonder,
