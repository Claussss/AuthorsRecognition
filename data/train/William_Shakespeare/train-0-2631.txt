KING EDWARD As wise as fair—what fond fit can be heard
When wisdom keeps the gate as beauty’s guard?
Countess, albeit my business urgeth me
It shall attend while I attend on thee.
Come on, my lords, here will I host tonight. Exeunt all but Lodowick I might perceive his eye in her eye lost,
His ear to drink her sweet tongue’s utterance,
And changing passion, like inconstant clouds
That rack upon the carriage of the winds,
Increase and die in his disturbed cheeks.
Lo, when she blushed, even then did he look pale,
As if her cheeks by some enchanted power
Attracted had the cherry blood from his.
Anon, with reverent fear when she grew pale,
His cheeks put on their scarlet ornaments,
But no more like her oriental red
Than brick to coral or live things to dead.
Why did he then thus counterfeit her looks?
If she did blush, ‘twas tender modest shame
Being in the sacred presence of a king.
If he did blush, ’twas rude immodest shame
To vail his eyes amiss, being a king.
If she looked pale, ‘twas seely woman’s fear
To bear herself in presence of a king.
If he looked pale, it was with guilty fear
To dote amiss, being a mighty king.
Then, Scottish wars, farewell. I fear ’twill prove
A ling’ring English siege of peevish love.
