LANCELOT Serve you, sir. GOBBO (to Bassiano) That is the very defect of the matter, sir. BASSANIO (to Lancelot) I know thee well. Thou hast obtained thy suit.
Shylock thy master spoke with me this day,
And hath preferred thee, if it be preferment
To leave a rich Jewâ€™s service to become
The follower of so poor a gentleman.
