MENENIUS (to the tribunes) Why, so! You have made good work.
A pair of tribunes that have wracked fair Rome
To make coals cheap—a noble memory! I minded him how royal ’twas to pardon
When it was less expected. He replied
It was a bare petition of a state
To one whom they had punished. MENENIUS Very well.
