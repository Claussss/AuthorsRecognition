Coriolanus sits FIRST SENATOR Speak, good Cominius. Leave nothing out for length, and make us think
Rather our state’s defective for requital
Than we to stretch it out.
(To the tribunes) Masters o’th’ people,
We do request your kindest ears and, after,
Your loving motion toward the common body
To yield what passes here.
