I thank you, general, But cannot make my heart consent to take
A bribe to pay my sword. I do refuse it,
And stand upon my common part with those
That have upheld the doing. A long flourish. They all cry ‘Martius, Martius!’, casting up their caps and lances. Cominius and Lartius stand bare  May these same instruments which you profane
Never sound more. When drums and trumpets shall
I’th’ field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be
Made all of false-faced soothing. When steel grows
Soft as the parasite’s silk, let him be made
An overture for th’ wars. No more, I say.
For that I have not washed my nose that bled,
Or foiled some debile wretch, which without note
Here’s many else have done, you shout me forth
In acclamations hyperbolical,
As if I loved my little should be dieted
In praises sauced with lies.
