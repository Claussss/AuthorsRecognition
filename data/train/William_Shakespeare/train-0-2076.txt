RICHARD GLOUCESTER I do suspect I have done some offence
That seems disgracious in the city’s eye,
And that you come to reprehend my ignorance. You have, my lord. Would it might please your grace
On our entreaties to amend your fault. RICHARD GLOUCESTER Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land? Know then, it is your fault that you resign
The supreme seat, the throne majestical,
The sceptred office of your ancestors,
Your state of fortune and your due of birth,
The lineal glory of your royal house,
To the corruption of a blemished stock,
Whiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts—
Which here we waken to our country’s good—
The noble isle doth want her proper limbs:
Her face defaced with scars of infamy,
Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants
And almost shouldered in the swallowing gulf
Of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion,
Which to recure we heartily solicit
Your gracious self to take on you the charge
And kingly government of this your land—
Not as Protector, steward, substitute,
Or lowly factor for another’s gain,
But as successively, from blood to blood,
Your right of birth, your empery, your own.
For this, consorted with the citizens,
Your very worshipful and loving friends,
And by their vehement instigation,
In this just cause come I to move your grace.
