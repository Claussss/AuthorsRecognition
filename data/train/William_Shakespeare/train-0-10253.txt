BRUTUS (to Sicinius) Mark you that? To brag unto them ‘Thus I did, and thus’,
Show them th’unaching scars, which I should hide,
As if I had received them for the hire
Of their breath only! MENENIUS Do not stand upon’t.— We recommend to you, tribunes of the people,
Our purpose to them; and to our noble consul
Wish we all joy and honour.
