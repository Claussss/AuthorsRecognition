‘To thee, to thee my heaved-up hands appeal,
Not to seducing lust, thy rash relier.
I sue for exiled majesty’s repeal;
Let him return, and flatt’ring thoughts retire.
His true respect will prison false desire, And wipe the dim mist from thy doting eyne,
That thou shalt see thy state, and pity mine.’
