This said, he struck his hand upon his breast,
And kissed the fatal knife to end his vow,
And to his protestation urged the rest,
Who, wondâ€™ring at him, did his words allow.
Then jointly to the ground their knees they bow, And that deep vow which Brutus made before
He doth again repeat, and that they swore.
