I will, my lord. But I must speak with him. EARL OF SALISBURY Why, so thou shalt! Take horse and post from hence—
Only before thou go’st, swear by thy faith
That if thou canst not compass my desire,
Thou wilt return my prisoner back again,
And that shall be sufficient warrant for me. To that condition I agree, my lord,
And will unfeignedly perform the same.
