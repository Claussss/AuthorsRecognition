I trust in me she will think no danger;
For I love well the company of fair womenâ€”
And, though to you I am a stranger,
Yet Wit may pleasure you now and then. Who, you? Nay, you are such a holy man
That to touch one you dare not be bold.
I think you would not kiss a young woman
If one would give ye twenty pound in gold.
