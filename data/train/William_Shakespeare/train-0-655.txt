Here’s Lucentio, right son to the right Vincentio,
That have by marriage made thy daughter mine,
While counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne. Here’s packing with a witness, to deceive us all. Where is that damned villain Tranio,
That faced and braved me in this matter so? Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?
