Very well, my liege. I have spoke long. Be pleased yourself to say
How far you satisfied me. So please your highness, The question did at first so stagger me,
Bearing a state of mighty moment in’t
And consequence of dread, that I committed
The daring’st counsel which I had to doubt,
And did entreat your highness to this course
Which you are running here.
