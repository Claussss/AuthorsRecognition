FRIAR LAURENCE Who bare my letter then to Romeo? I could not send it—here it is again—
Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
So fearful were they of infection. FRIAR LAURENCE Unhappy fortune
The letter was not nice, but full of charge,
Of dear import, and the neglecting it
May do much danger. Friar John, go hence.
Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight
Unto my cell.
