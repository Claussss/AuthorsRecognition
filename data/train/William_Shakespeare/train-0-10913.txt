Give me your hand. Have you no more to say? Few words, but to effect more than all yet:
That when we have found the King—in which your
pain
That way, I’ll this—he that first lights on him
Holla the other. Exeunt severally 3.2
Storm still. Enter King Lear and his Fool Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! Rage, blow,
You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout
Till you have drenched our steeples, drowned the
cocks!
You sulph‘rous and thought-executing fires,
Vaunt-couriers of oak-cleaving thunderbolts,
Singe my white head; and thou all-shaking thunder,
Strike flat the thick rotundity o’th’ world,
Crack nature’s moulds, all germens spill at once
That makes ingrateful man.
