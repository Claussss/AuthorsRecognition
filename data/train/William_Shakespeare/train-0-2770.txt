PRINCE OF WALES This heaven that covers France contains the mercy
That draws from me submissive orisons.
That such base breath should vanish from my lips
To urge the plea of mercy to a man,
The Lord forbid. Return and tell thy King:
My tongue is made of steel, and it shall beg
My mercy on his coward burgonet.
Tell him my colours are as red as his,
My men as bold, our English arms as strong.
Return him my defiance in his face.
