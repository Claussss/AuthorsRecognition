We have descried upon our neighbouring shore
A portly sail of ships make hitherward. CLEON I thought as much. One sorrow never comes but brings an heir
That may succeed as his inheritor,
And so in ours. Some neighbour nation,
Taking advantage of our misery,
Hath stuffed these hollow vessels with their power
To beat us down, the which are down already,
And make a conquest of unhappy men,
Whereas no gloryâ€™s got to overcome.
