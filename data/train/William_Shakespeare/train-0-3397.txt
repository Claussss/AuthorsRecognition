BOLINGBROKE My gracious uncle, let me know my fault.
On what condition stands it and wherein? Even in condition of the worst degree:
In gross rebellion and detested treason.
Thou art a banished man, and here art come
Before the expiration of thy time
In braving arms against thy sovereign. BOLINGBROKE standing
