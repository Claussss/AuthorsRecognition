Enter Lodowick  Go, Lod’wick, put thy hand into my purse—
Play, spend, give, riot, waste, do what thou wilt
So thou wilt hence awhile and leave me here. Exit Lodowick (To the Countess) Now, my soul’s playfellow, art thou come
To speak the more-than-heavenly word of ‘yea’
To my objection in thy beauteous love?
