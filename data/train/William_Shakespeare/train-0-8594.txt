FOOL He that has a house to put his head in has a good headpiece. The codpiece that will house Before the head has any,
The head and he shall louse,
So beggars marry many.
The man that makes his toe
What he his heart should make
Shall have a corn cry woe,
And turn his sleep to wakeâ€” for there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths in a glass.
