DESDEMONA The heavens forbid But that our loves and comforts should increase
Even as our days do grow. OTHELLO Amen to that, sweet powers! I cannot speak enough of this content.
It stops me here, it is too much of joy.
And this, (they kiss) and this, the greatest discords be
That eâ€™er our hearts shall make.
