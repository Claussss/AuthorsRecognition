MIRANDA Miranda. O my father, I have broke your best to say so! Admired Miranda! Indeed the top of admiration, worth
What’s dearest to the world. Full many a lady
I have eyed with best regard, and many a time
Th’harmony of their tongues hath into bondage
Brought my too diligent ear. For several virtues
Have I liked several women; never any
With so full soul but some defect in her
Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed
And put it to the foil. But you, O you,
So perfect and so peerless, are created
Of every creature’s best.
