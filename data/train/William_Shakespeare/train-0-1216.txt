RICHARD OF GLOUCESTER And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge,
Is now dishonoured by this new marriage. KING EDWARD What if both Louis and Warwick be appeased
By such invention as I can devise? Yet, to have joined with France in such alliance
Would more have strengthened this our
commonwealth
â€™Gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage.
