Alas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight.
Grief of my son’s exile hath stopped her breath. 210
What further woe conspires against mine age? PRINCE Look, and thou shalt see. MONTAGUE (seeing Romeo’s body) O thou untaught! What manners is in this,
To press before thy father to a grave? Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while, 215
Till we can clear these ambiguities
And know their spring, their head, their true descent;
And then will I be general of your woes,
And lead you even to death. Meantime, forbear,
And let mischance be slave to patience. 220
Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
