This said, she hasteth to a myrtle grove,
Musing the morning is so much oâ€™erworn
And yet she hears no tidings of her love.
She hearkens for his hounds, and for his horn. Anon she hears them chant it lustily,
And all in haste she coasteth to the cry. And as she runs, the bushes in the way
Some catch her by the neck, some kiss her face,
Some twine about her thigh to make her stay.
She wildly breaketh from their strict embrace,
