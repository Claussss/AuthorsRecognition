Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
A villain that is hither come in spite
To scorn at our solemnity this night. Young Romeo, is it? TYBALT â€™Tis he, that villain Romeo. Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone.
A bears him like a portly gentleman,
And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
To be a virtuous and well-governed youth.
I would not for the wealth of all this town
Here in my house do him disparagement.
Therefore be patient, take no note of him.
It is my will, the which if thou respect,
Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
