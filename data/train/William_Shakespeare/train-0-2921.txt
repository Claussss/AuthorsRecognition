I pray you, sir, receive the money now,
For fear you ne’er see chain nor money more. You are a merry man, sir. Fare you well. Exit ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE What I should think of this I cannot tell.
But this I think: there’s no man is so vain
That would refuse so fair an offered chain.
I see a man here needs not live by shifts,
When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.
I’ll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay.
If any ship put out, then straight away! Exit
