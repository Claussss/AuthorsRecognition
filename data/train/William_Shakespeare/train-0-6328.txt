ORLANDO A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say ‘Wit, whither wilt?’ ROSALIND Nay, you might keep that check for it till you met your wife’s wit going to your neighbour’s bed. ORLANDO And what wit could wit have to excuse that? ROSALIND Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall never take her without her answer unless you take her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot make her fault her husband’s occasion, let her never nurse her child herself, for she will breed it like a fool.
