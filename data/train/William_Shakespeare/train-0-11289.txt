My brother wears thee not one half so well
As when thou grewâ€™st thyself. BELARIUS O melancholy, Who ever yet could sound thy bottom, find
The ooze to show what coast thy sluggish crare
Might easiliest harbour in? Thou bless
Jove knows what man thou mightst have made;
but I,
Thou diedst a most rare boy, of melancholy.
(To Arviragus) How found you him?
