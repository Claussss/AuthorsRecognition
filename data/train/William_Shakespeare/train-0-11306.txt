’Lack, good youth, Thou mov’st no less with thy complaining than
Thy master in bleeding. Say his name, good friend. Richard du Champ. (Aside) If I do lie and do
No harm by it, though the gods hear I hope
They’ll pardon it. (Aloud) Say you, sir? Fidele, sir. Thou dost approve thyself the very same.
Thy name well fits thy faith, thy faith thy name.
Wilt take thy chance with me? I will not say
Thou shalt be so well mastered, but be sure,
No less beloved. The Roman Emperor’s letters
Sent by a consul to me should not sooner
Than thine own worth prefer thee. Go with me.
