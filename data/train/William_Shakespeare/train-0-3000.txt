ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS This day, great Duke, she shut the doors upon me
While she with harlots feasted in my house. A grievous fautt!—Say, woman, didst thou so? No, my good lord. Myself, he, and my sister
Today did dine together. So befall my soul
As this is false he burdens me withal. Ne’er may I look on day nor sleep on night
But she tells to your highness simple truth.
