FRENCH SOLDIER O prenez mis ‘Moy’ shall not serve, I will have forty ‘moys’,
Or I will fetch thy rim out at thy throat
In drops of crimson blood. FRENCH SOLDIER Est-il impossible d Brass, cur? Thou damned and luxurious mountain
goat,
Offer’st me brass? FRENCH SOLDIER O pardonne-moi! Sayst thou me so? Is that a ton of moys?—
Come hither boy. Ask me this slave in French
What is his name.
