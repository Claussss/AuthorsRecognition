Royal wench! She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed.
He ploughed her, and she cropped. I saw her once Hop forty paces through the public street,
And having lost her breath, she spoke and panted,
That she did make defect perfection,
And breathless, pour breath forth. Must leave her utterly. Never. He will not.
