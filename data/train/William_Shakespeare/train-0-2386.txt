And when great treasure is the meed proposed,
Though death be adjunct, thereâ€™s no death supposed. Those that much covet are with gain so fond
That what they have not, that which they possess,
They scatter and unloose it from their bond,
And so by hoping more they have but less,
Or, gaining more, the profit of excess
