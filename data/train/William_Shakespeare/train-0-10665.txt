O cursed wretch, That knewâ€™st this was the Prince, and wouldst
adventure
To mingle faith with him. Undone, undone!
If I might die within this hour, I have lived
To die when I desire. Exit FLORIZEL (to Perdita) Why look you so upon me? I am but sorry, not afeard; delayed,
But nothing altered. What I was, I am,
More straining on for plucking back, not following
My leash unwillingly.
