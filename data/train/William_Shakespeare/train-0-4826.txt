I have operations which be humours of revenge. Wilt thou revenge? NIM By welkin and her stars! With wit or steel? NIM With both the humours, I. I will discuss the humour of this love to Ford. And I to Page shall eke unfold
How Falstaff, varlet vile,
His dove will prove, his gold will hold,
And his soft couch defile.
