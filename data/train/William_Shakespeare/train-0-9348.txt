Let me shake thy hand. Pompey and Enobarbus shake hands I never hated thee. I have seen thee fight
When I have envied thy behaviour. Sir, I never loved you much, but I haâ€™ praised ye
When you have well deserved ten times as much
As I have said you did. Enjoy thy plainness. It nothing ill becomes thee.
Aboard my galley I invite you all.
Will you lead, lords?
