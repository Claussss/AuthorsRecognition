KING EDWARD Here, English lords, we do proclaim a rest,
An intercession of our painful arms.
Sheathe up your swords, refresh your weary limbs,
Peruse your spoils, and after we have breathed
A day or two within this haven town,
God willing, then for England weâ€™ll be shipped,
Where in a happy hour I trust we shall
Arrive: three kings, two princes, and a queen.
