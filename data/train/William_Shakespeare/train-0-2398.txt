And extreme fear can neither fight nor fly,
But coward-like with trembling terror die. â€˜Had Collatinus killed my son or sire,
Or lain in ambush to betray my life,
Or were he not my dear friend, this desire
Might have excuse to work upon his wife
As in revenge or quittal of such strife. But as he is my kinsman, my dear friend,
The shame and fault finds no excuse nor end.
