AJAX Thou trumpet, there’s my purse. He gives him money Now crack thy lungs and split thy brazen pipe.
Blow, villain, till thy spher
Outswell the colic of puffed Aquilon.
Come, stretch thy chest and let thy eyes spout blood;
Thou blow’st for Hector. The trumpet sounds ULYSSES No trumpet answers. ACHILLES ’Tis but early days.
