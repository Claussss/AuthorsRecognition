Alas, sir, it is worse for me than so,
For I have bills for money by exchange
From Florence, and must here deliver them. Well, sir, to do you courtesy
This will I do, and this I will advise you.
First tell me, have you ever been at Pisa? Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,
Pisa renowned for grave citizens.
