Young Martius kneels CORIOLANUS That’s my brave boy. Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself
Are suitors to you. CORIOLANUS I beseech you, peace. Or if you’d ask, remember this before:
The things I have forsworn to grant may never
Be held by you denials. Do not bid me
Dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate
Again with Rome’s mechanics. Tell me not
Wherein I seem unnatural. Desire not t’allay
My rages and revenges with your colder reasons.
