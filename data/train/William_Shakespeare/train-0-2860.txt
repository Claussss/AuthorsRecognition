Enter Dromio of Syracuse How now, sir, is your merry humour altered?
As you love strokes, so jest with me again.
You know no Centaur? You received no gold?
Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?
My house was at the Phoenix?â€”Wast thou mad,
That thus so madly thou didst answer me? DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
