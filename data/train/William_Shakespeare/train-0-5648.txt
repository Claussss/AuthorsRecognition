BENEDICK Think not on him till tomorrow, I’ll devise thee brave punishments for him. Strike up, pipers. Dance, and exeunt THE Chorus to Act 5 of Henry V contains an uncharacteristic, direct topical reference: Were now the General of our gracious Empress—
As in good time he may—from Ireland coming,
Bringing rebellion broached on his sword,
How many would the peaceful city quit
To welcome him!
