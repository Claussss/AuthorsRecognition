With three-fold love I wish you all these three. O, shall I say ‘I thank you, gentle wife’? Not so, my lord. A twelvemonth and a day
I’ll mark no words that smooth-faced wooers say.
Come when the King doth to my lady come;
Then if I have much love, I’ll give you some. I’ll serve thee true and faithfully till then.
