i. AFTER 4.I.96 In the Folio, the characters do not exit during the Duchess of York’s preceding speech. QUEEN ELIZABETH Stay: yet look back with me unto the Tower.—
Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes,
Whom envy hath immured within your walls.
Rough cradle for such little pretty ones,
Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow
For tender princes: use my babies well.
So foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell.
