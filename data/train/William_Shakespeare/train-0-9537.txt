Think you there was, or might be, such a man
As this I dreamt of? Gentle madam, no. You lie, up to the hearing of the gods.
But if there be, or ever were one such,
It’s past the size of dreaming. Nature wants stuff
To vie strange forms with fancy; yet t‘imagine
An Antony were nature’s piece ’gainst fancy,
Condemning shadows quite.
