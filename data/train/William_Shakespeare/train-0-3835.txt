Exit Philostrate Hippolyta, I wooed thee with my sword,
And won thy love doing thee injuries.
But I will wed thee in another key—
With pomp, with triumph, and with revelling. Enter Egeus and his daughter Hermia, and Lysander and Demetrius Happy be Theseus, our renowned Duke. Thanks, good Egeus. What’s the news with thee?
