KING HENRY (embracing Campeius) And once more in mine arms I bid him welcome,
And thank the holy conclave for their loves.
They have sent me such a man I would have wished for. CARDINAL CAMPEIUS Your grace must needs deserve all strangers’ loves,
You are so noble. To your highness’ hand
I tender my commission,
