How many women saw this child of his? Why, so, brave lords, when we do join in league
I am a lamb; but if you brave the Moor,
The chafed boar, the mountain lioness,
The ocean swells not so as Aaron storms.
(To the Nurse) But say again, how many saw the
child? Cornelia the midwife, and myself,
And no one else but the delivered Empress.
