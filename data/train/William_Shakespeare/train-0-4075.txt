QUEEN ELEANOR His mother shames him so, poor boy, he weeps. Now shame upon you, whe’er she does or no !
His grandam’s wrongs, and not his mother’s shames,
Draw those heaven-moving pearls from his poor eyes,
Which heaven shall take in nature of a fee; 170
Ay, with these crystal beads heaven shall be bribed
To do him justice and revenge on you.
