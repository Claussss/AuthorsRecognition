How many fond fools serve mad jealousy! 2.2
Enter Antipholus of Syracuse 
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up
Safe at the Centaur, and the heedful slave
Is wandered forth in care to seek me out.
By computation and mine hostâ€™s report,
I could not speak with Dromio since at first
I sent him from the mart! See, here he comes.
