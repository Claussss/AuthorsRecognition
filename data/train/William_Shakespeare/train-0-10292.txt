Well, no more. No more words, we beseech you. CORIOLANUS How, no more? As for my country I have shed my blood,
Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs
Coin words till their decay against those measles
Which we disdain should tetter us, yet sought
The very way to catch them. You speak o’th’ people as if you were a god
To punish, not a man of their infirmity.
