Welcome, Master Morris! What news, sir? I come most humbly to entreat your honour
In the behalf of a poor man of mine. What, the votary that will not cut his hair
Until the expiration of his vow? My lord, being sorry for his rude behaviour,
He hath cut his hair, and doth conform himself
To honest decency in his attire.
