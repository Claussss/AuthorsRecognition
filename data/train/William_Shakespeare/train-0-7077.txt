And wake him to the answer, think you? Yes, ‘tis most meet. Who may you else oppose,
That can from Hector bring his honour off,
If not Achilles? Though’t be a sportful combat,
Yet in this trial much opinion dwells,
For here the Trojans taste our dear’st repute
With their fin‘st palate. And trust to me, Ulysses,
Our imputation shall be oddly poised
In this wild action: for the success,
Although particular, shall give a scantling
Of good or bad unto the general—
And in such indices, although small pricks
To their subsequent volumes, there is seen
The baby figure of the giant mass
Of things to come at large. It is supposed
He that meets Hector issues from our choice,
And choice, being mutual act of all our souls,
Makes merit her election, and doth boil,
As ’twere, from forth us all a man distilled
Out of our virtues—who miscarrying,
What heart from hence receives the conqu‘ring part
To steel a strong opinion to themselves?
Which entertained, limbs are e’en his instruments,
In no less working than are swords and bows
Directive by the limbs.
