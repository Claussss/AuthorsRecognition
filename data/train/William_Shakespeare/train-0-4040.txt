 What men are you? Your faithful subject I, a gentleman 50
Born in Northamptonshire, and eldest son,
As I suppose, to Robert Falconbridge,
A soldier, by the honour-giving hand
Of C knighted in the field. KING JOHN What art thou? 55 FALCONBRIDGE The son and heir to that same Falconbridge. Is that the elder, and art thou the heir?
You came not of one mother then, it seems.
