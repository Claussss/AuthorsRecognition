The iron bit he crusheth â€˜tween his teeth,
Controlling what he was controlled with. His ears up-pricked, his braided hanging mane
Upon his compassed crest now stand on end;
His nostrils drink the air, and forth again,
As from a furnace, vapours doth he send. His eye, which scornfully glisters like fire,
Shows his hot courage and his high desire.
