QUEEN MARGARET (aside) A murd’rous villain, and so still thou art. RICHARD GLOUCESTER Poor Clarence did forsake his father Warwick—
Ay, and forswore himself, which Jesu pardon— QUEEN MARGARET (aside) Which God revenge! RICHARD GLOUCESTER To fight on Edward’s party for the crown,
And for his meed, poor lord, he is mewed up.
I would to God my heart were flint like Edward’s,
Or Edward’s soft and pitiful like mine.
I am too childish-foolish for this world.
