Fare you well. Do we but find the tyrant’s power tonight,
Let us be beaten if we cannot fight. Make all our trumpets speak, give them all breath,
Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.
Exeunt. Alarums continued 5.7
Enter Macbeth They have tied me to a stake. I cannot fly,
But bear-like I must fight the course. What’s he
That was not born of woman? Such a one
Am I to fear, or none.
