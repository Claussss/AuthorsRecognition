John Benson, in Shakespeare’s Poems (1640) 
Of Master William Shakespeare What, lofty Shakespeare, art again revived,
 And Virbius-like now show‘st thyself twice lived?
 ’Tis Benson’s love that thus to thee is shown,
 The labour’s his, the glory still thine own.
 These learn
 That makes thy name immortal on the earth,
 Will make the learn
 The muses’ gifts so fully infused on thee.
 Let carping Momus bark and bite his fill,
 And ignorant Davus slight thy learn
 Yet those who know the worth of thy desert,
 And with true judgement can discern thy art,
 Will be admirers of thy high-tuned strain,
 Amongst whose number let me still remain.
