Enter the conspirators, muffled: Cassius, Casca, Decius, Cinna, Metellus, and Trebonius I think we are too bold upon your rest.
Good morrow, Brutus. Do we trouble you? I have been up this hour, awake all night.
Know I these men that come along with you? Yes, every man of them; and no man here
But honours you; and every one doth wish
You had but that opinion of yourself
Which every noble Roman bears of you.
This is Trebonius.
