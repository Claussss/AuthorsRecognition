GLOUCESTER O, let me kiss that hand! LEAR Here, wipe it first; it smells of mortality. O ruined piece of nature! This great world
Shall so wear out to naught. Do you know me? LEAR I remember thy eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny on me? No, do thy worst, blind Cupid, I’ll not love.
Read thou that challenge. Mark the penning of’t.
