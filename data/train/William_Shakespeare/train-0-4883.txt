SIR JOHN Good Master Brooke, I desire more acquaintance of you. FORD Good Sir John, I sue for yoursâ€”not to charge you, for I must let you understand I think myself in better plight for a lender than you are; the which hath something emboldened me to this unseasoned intrusion; for they say if money go before, all ways do lie open.
