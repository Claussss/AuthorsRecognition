Exit Desdemona  (To Lodovico) Cassio shall have my place, and, sir,
tonight
I do entreat that we may sup together.
You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus. Goats and monkeys! Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate
Call all-in-all sufficient? Is this the nature
Whom passion could not shake, whose solid virtue
The shot of accident nor dart of chance
Could neither graze nor pierce?
