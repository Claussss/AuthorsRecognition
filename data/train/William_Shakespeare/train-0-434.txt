SECOND SERVINGMAN Will’t please your mightiness to wash your hands?
O, how we joy to see your wit restored!
O that once more you knew but what you are!
These fifteen years you have been in a dream,
Or when you waked, so waked as if you slept. These fifteen years—by my fay, a goodly nap.
But did I never speak of all that time?
