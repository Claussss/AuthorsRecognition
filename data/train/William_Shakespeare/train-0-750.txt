She lies down upon her face.
Enter Eleanor, the Duchess of Gloucester, aloft John Southwell, read you and let us to our work. DUCHESS Well said, my masters, and welcome all. To this gear the sooner the better. Enter Hume aloft BOLINGBROKE Patience, good lady—wizards know their times.
Deep night, dark night, the silent of the night,
The time of night when Troy was set on fire,
The time when screech-owls cry and bandogs howl,
And spirits walk, and ghosts break up their graves—
That time best fits the work we have in hand.
Madam, sit you, and fear not. Whom we raise
We will make fast within a hallowed verge.
