FROTH I thank your worship. For mine own part, I never come into any room in a tap-house but I am drawn in. ESCALUS Well, no more of it, Master Froth. Farewell. Come you hither to me, Master Tapster. Whatâ€™s your
name, Master Tapster? POMPEY Pompey. ESCALUS What else? POMPEY Bum, sir. ESCALUS Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you; so that, in the beastliest sense, you are Pompey the Great. Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey, howsoever you colour it in being a tapster, are you not? Come, tell me true; it shall be the better for you.
