The interruption of their churlish drums
Cuts off more circumstance. They are at hand;
To parley or to fight therefore prepare. KING PHILIP How much unlooked-for is this expedition I By how much unexpected, by so much 80
We must awake endeavour for defence, For courage mounteth with occasion. Let them be welcome then: we are prepared.
