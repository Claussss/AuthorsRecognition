IAGO Hast stol’n it from her? No, faith, she let it drop by negligence,
And to th‘advantage I, being here, took’t up.
Look, here ’tis. IAGO A good wench! Give it me. What will you do with it, that you have been so earnest
To have me filch it? IAGO Why, what is that to you? He takes the napkin If it be not for some purpose of import,
Give’t me again. Poor lady, she’ll run mad
When she shall lack it.
