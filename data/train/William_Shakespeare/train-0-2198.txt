No doubt, my lord. KING RICHARD Ratcliffe, I fear, I fear. Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows. KING RICHARD By the Apostle Paul, shadows tonight
Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard
Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers
Armed in proof and led by shallow Richmond.
’Tis not yet near day. Come, go with me.
Under our tents I’ll play the eavesdropper,
To see if any mean to shrink from me.
