Round-hoofed, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
Broad breast, full eye, small head, and nostril wide,
High crest, short ears, straight legs, and passing
strong;
Thin mane, thick tail, broad buttock, tender hideâ€” Look what a horse should have he did not lack,
Save a proud rider on so proud a back.
