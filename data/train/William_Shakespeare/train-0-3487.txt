NORTHUMBERLAND My guilt be on my head, and there an end.
Take leave and part, for you must part forthwith. Doubly divorced! Bad men, you violate
A twofold marriage:‘twixt my crown and me,
And then betwixt me and my married wife.
(To the Queen) Let me unkiss the oath ’twixt thee and me—
And yet not so, for with a kiss ‘twas made.
Part us, Northumberland: I towards the north,
Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime;
My queen to France, from whence set forth in pomp
She came adorned hither like sweet May,
Sent back like Hallowmas or short’st of day.
