FIRST CONSPIRATOR So he did, my lord. The army marvelled at it, and in the last,
When he had carried Rome and that we looked
For no less spoil than glory— There was it, For which my sinews shall be stretched upon him.
At a few drops of women’s rheum, which are
As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour
Of our great action; therefore shall he die,
And I’ll renew me in his fall.
