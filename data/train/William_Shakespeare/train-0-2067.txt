RICHARD GLOUCESTER And did they SO? No, so God help me. They spake not a word,
But, like dumb statuas or breathing stones,
Stared each on other and looked deadly pale—
Which, when I saw, I reprehended them,
And asked the Mayor, what meant this wilful silence?
His answer was, the people were not used
To be spoke to but by the Recorder.
Then he was urged to tell my tale again:
‘Thus saith the Duke... thus hath the Duke inferred’—
But nothing spoke in warrant from himself.
When he had done, some followers of mine own,
At lower end of the Hall, hurled up their caps,
And some ten voices cried ‘God save King Richard!’
And thus I took the vantage of those few:
‘Thanks, gentle citizens and friends’, quoth I;
‘This general applause and cheerful shout
Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard’—
And even here brake off and came away.
