Cranmer weeps Look, the good man weeps. He’s honest, on mine honour. God’s blest mother,
I swear he is true-hearted, and a soul
None better in my kingdom. Get you gone,
And do as I have bid you. Exit Cranmer He has strangled His language in his tears. Enter the Old Lady Enter Lovell, following her I’ll not come back. The tidings that I bring
Will make my boldness manners. (To the King) Now
good angels
Fly o’er thy royal head, and shade thy person
Under their blessed wings.
