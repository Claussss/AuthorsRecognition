RICHARD GLOUCESTER Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.
(Aside) Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business,
And finds the testy gentleman so hot
That he will lose his head ere give consent
His ‘master’s child’—as worshipful he terms it—
Shall lose the royalty of England’s throne. Withdraw yourself a while; I’ll go with you.
