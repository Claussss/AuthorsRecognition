CASSIUS (aside to Brutus) I know not what may fall. I like it not. Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar’s body.
You shall not in your funeral speech blame us;
But speak all good you can devise of Caesar,
And say you do’t by our permission;
Else shall you not have any hand at all
About his funeral. And you shall speak
In the same pulpit whereto I am going,
After my speech is ended.
