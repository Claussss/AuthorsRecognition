CORIN Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress’s brother. Enter Rosalind as Ganymede ROSALIND (reads) ‘From the east to western Ind
No jewel is like Rosalind.
Her worth being mounted on the wind
Through all the world bears Rosalind.
All the pictures fairest lined
Are but black to Rosalind.
Let no face be kept in mind
But the fair of Rosalind.’
