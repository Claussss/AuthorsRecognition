2.3
Enter Anne Boleyn and an Old Lady Not for that neither. Here’s the pang that pinches—
His highness having lived so long with her, and she
So good a lady that no tongue could ever
Pronounce dishonour of her—by my life,
She never knew harm-doing—O now, after
So many courses of the sun enthroned,
Still growing in a majesty and pomp the which
To leave a thousandfold more bitter than
’Tis sweet at first t’acquire—after this process,
To give her the avaunt, it is a pity
Would move a monster.
