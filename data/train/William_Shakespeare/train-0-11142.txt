GIACOMO That others do— I was about to say enjoy your—but
It is an office of the gods to venge it,
Not mine to speak on’t. You do seem to know Something of me, or what concerns me. Pray you,
Since doubting things go ill often hurts more
Than to be sure they do—for certainties
Either are past remedies, or, timely knowing,
The remedy then born—discover to me
What both you spur and stop.
