They kneel before the altar, fall on their faces, then on their knees again (Praying to Mars) Thou mighty one,
 That with thy power hast turned green Neptune into
purple;
Whose havoc in vast field comets prewarn,
Unearthed skulls proclaim; whose breath blows down
The teeming Ceres’ foison; who dost pluck
With hand armipotent from forth blue clouds
The masoned turrets, that both mak’st and break’st
The stony girths of cities; me thy pupil,
Youngest follower of thy drum, instruct this day
With military skill, that to thy laud
I may advance my streamer, and by thee
Be styled the lord o’th’ day. Give me, great Mars,
Some token of thy pleasure.
