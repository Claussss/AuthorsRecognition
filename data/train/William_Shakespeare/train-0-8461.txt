BURGUNDY Royal majesty, I crave no more than what your highness offered;
Nor will you tender less. LEAR Right noble Burgundy, When she was dear to us we did hold her so;
But now her price is fallen. Sir, there she stands.
If aught within that little seeming substance,
Or all of it, with our displeasure pieced,
And nothing else, may fitly like your grace,
Sheâ€™s there, and she is yours.
