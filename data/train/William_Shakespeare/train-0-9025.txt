The Witches vanish The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,
And these are of them. Whither are they vanished? Into the air, and what seemed corporal
Melted as breath into the wind. Would they had stayed. Were such things here as we do speak about,
Or have we eaten on the insane root
That takes the reason prisoner?
