QUEEN MARGARET Go rate thy minions, proud insulting boy!
Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms
Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king? I am his king, and he should bow his knee.
I was adopted heir by his consent. GEORGE (to Queen Margaret) Since when his oath is brokeâ€”for, as I hear,
You that are king, though he do wear the crown,
Have caused him by new act of Parliament
To blot our brother out, and put his own son in.
