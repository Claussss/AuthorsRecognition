I have not to a period brought her praise. KING EDWARD Her praise is as my Love—both infinite,
Which apprehend such violent extremes
That they disdain an ending period.
Her beauty hath no match but my affection;
Hers more than most, mine most, and more than more;
Hers more to praise than tell the sea by drops—
Nay more!—than drop the massy earth by sands,
And sand by sand print them in memory.
Then wherefore talk’st thou of a period
To that which craves unended admiration?
Read. Let us hear.
