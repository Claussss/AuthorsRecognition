Heralds, from off our towers we might behold 325
From first to last the onset and retire
Of both your armies, whose equality
By our best eyes cannot be censur
Blood hath bought blood and blows have answered
blows,
Strength matched with strength and power confronted
power. 330
Both are alike, and both alike we like.
One must prove greatest. While they weigh so even,
We hold our town for neither, yet for both.
