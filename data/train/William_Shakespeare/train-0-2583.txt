By this starts Collatine as from a dream,
And bids Lucretius give his sorrow place;
And then in key-cold Lucreceâ€™ bleeding stream
He falls, and bathes the pale fear in his face,
And counterfeits to die with her a space, Till manly shame bids him possess his breath,
And live to be revenged on her death.
