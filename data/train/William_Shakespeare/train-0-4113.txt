Exeunt Salisbury and Arthur 
3.1 Flourish.Enter King John and King Philip hand in hand; Louis the Dauphin and Lady Blanche, married; Queen Eleanor, the Bastard, and the Duke of Austria 
KING PHILIP (to Blanche) 
Ever in France shall be kept festival.
To solemnize this day, the glorious sun
Stays in his course and plays the alchemist,
Turning with splendour of his precious eye 5
The meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold.
The yearly course that brings this day about
Shall never see it but a holy day.
