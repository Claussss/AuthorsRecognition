Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be king. Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown. ’Twas by rebellion against his king. KING HENRY aside I know not what to say—my title’s weak.
(To York) Tell me, may not a king adopt an heir? YORK What then? An if he may, then am I lawful king—
For Richard, in the view of many lords,
Resigned the crown to Henry the Fourth,
Whose heir my father was, and I am his.
