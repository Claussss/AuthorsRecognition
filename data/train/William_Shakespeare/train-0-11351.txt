There’s business in these faces. Why so sadly
Greet you our victory? You look like Romans,
And not o’th’ court of Britain. Hail, great King! To sour your happiness I must report
The Queen is dead. Who worse than a physician Would this report become? But I consider
By medicine life may be prolonged, yet death
Will seize the doctor too. How ended she?
