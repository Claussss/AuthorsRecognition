And knows me, and knows me, How pitiful I deserve— I mean in singing; but in loving, Leander the good
swimmer, Troilus the first employer of panders, and a
whole book full of these quondam carpet-mongers
whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a
blank verse, why they were never so truly turned over
and over as my poor self in love. Marry, I cannot show
it in rhyme. I have tried. I can find out no rhyme to
‘lady’ but ‘baby‘, an innocent rhyme; for ‘scorn’ ‘horn’,
a hard rhyme; for ‘school’ ‘fool’, a babbling rhyme.
Very ominous endings. No, I was not born under a
rhyming planet, nor I cannot woo in festival terms.
