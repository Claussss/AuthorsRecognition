All form is formless, order orderless,
Save what is opposite to England’s love.
Therefore to arms, be champion of our Church,
Or let the Church, our mother, breathe her curse,
A mother’s curse, on her revolting son.
France, thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue,
A crazed lion by the mortal paw, 185
A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,
Than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold.
