KING Call them forth quickly, we will do so. Holla, approach! Enter Holofernes, Nathaniel, Costard, Mote, Dull, Jaquenetta, and others This side is Hiems, winter,
 This Ver, the spring, the one maintained by the owl,
The other by the cuckoo. Ver, begin. SPRING (sings) When daisies pied and violets blue,
And lady-smocks, all silver-white,
And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue
Do paint the meadows with delight,
The cuckoo then on every tree
Mocks married men, for thus sings he:
Cuckoo!
Cuckoo, cuckooâ€”O word of fear,
Unpleasing to a married ear.
