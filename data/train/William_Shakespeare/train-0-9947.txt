THAISA (to Pericles) But you, my knight and guest; To whom this wreath of victory I give, And crown you king of this day’s happiness. ’Tis more by fortune, lady, than my merit. KING SIMONIDES Call it by what you will, the day is yours,
And here I hope is none that envies it.
In framing artists art hath thus decreed,
To make some good, but others to exceed.
You are her laboured scholar. (To Thaisa) Come,
queen o’th’ feast—
For, daughter, so you are—here take your place.
(To Marshal) Marshal the rest as they deserve their
grace.
