(To Jordan) Beldam, I think we watched you at an inch.
(To the Duchess) What, madam, are you there? The
King and common weal
Are deep indebted for this piece of pains.
My lord Protector will, I doubt it not,
See you well guerdoned for these good deserts. Not half so bad as thine to England’s king,
Injurious Duke, that threatest where’s no cause.
