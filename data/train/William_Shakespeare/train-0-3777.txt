I hear him near.
Nurse! Wife! What ho, what, Nurse, I say! Enter the Nurse  Go waken Juliet. Go and trim her up.
I’ll go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste,
Make haste, the bridegroom he is come already.
Make haste, I say. Exit Mistress, what, mistress! Juliet! Fast, I warrant her, she.
Why, lamb, why, lady! Fie, you slug-abed!
Why, love, I say, madam, sweetheart, why, bride!
What, not a word? You take your pennyworths now.
Sleep for a week, for the next night, I warrant,
The County Paris hath set up his rest
That you shall rest but little. God forgive me!
Marry, and amen. How sound is she asleep!
I needs must wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
Ay, let the County take you in your bed.
He’ll fright you up, i’faith. Will it not be?
