DUKE Sir Valentine! Yonder is Silvia, and Silvia’s mine. Thurio, give back, or else embrace thy death.
Come not within the measure of my wrath.
Do not name Silvia thine. If once again,
Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands.
Take but possession of her with a touch—
I dare thee but to breathe upon my love.
