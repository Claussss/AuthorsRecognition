Enter Petruccio and Hortensio, with meat How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort? Mistress, what cheer? Faith, as cold as can be. Pluck up thy spirits, look cheerfully upon me.
Here, love, thou seest how diligent I am
To dress thy meat myself and bring it thee. 40

And all my pains is sorted to no proof.
Here, take away this dish.
