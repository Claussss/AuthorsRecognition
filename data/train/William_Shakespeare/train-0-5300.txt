’Tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb
In the dead carrion. Enter the Earl of Westmorland Who’s here? Westmorland? 80 WESTMORLAND Health to my sovereign, and new happiness
Added to that that I am to deliver I
Prince John your son doth kiss your grace’s hand.
Mowbray, the Bishop Scrope, Hastings, and all
Are brought to the correction of your law.
There is not now a rebel’s sword unsheathed,
But peace puts forth her olive everywhere.
The manner how this action hath been borne
Here at more leisure may your highness read,
With every course in his particular.
