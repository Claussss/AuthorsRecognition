Enter a Messenger that meets the Duke of York. Enter Richard Duke of York with a trumpeter and many soldiers 
RICHARD DUKE OF YORK Are not the speedy scouts returned again
That dogged the mighty army of the Dauphin? They are returned, my lord, and give it out
That he is marched to Bordeaux with his power
To fight with Talbot. As he marched along,
By your espials were discovered
Two mightier troops than that the Dauphin led,
Which joined with him and made their march for
Bordeaux.
