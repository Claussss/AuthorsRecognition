CAIUS Rugby, come to the court with me. (To Mistress Quickly) By Gar, if I have not Anne Page, I shall turn your head out of my door. Follow my heels, Rugby. MISTRESS QUICKLY You shall have Anne— Exeunt Caius and Rugby —ass-head of your own. No, I know Anne’s mind for
that. Never a woman in Windsor knows more of Anne’s
mind than I do, nor can do more than I do with her,
I thank heaven.
