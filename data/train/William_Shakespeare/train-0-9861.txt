KING (to Helen) Let us from point to point this story know
To make the even truth in pleasure flow.
(To Diana) If thou be
Choose thou thy husband and I’ll pay thy dower.
For I can guess that by thy honest aid
Thou kept’st a wife herself, thyself a maid.
Of that and all the progress more and less
Resolv
All yet seems well; and if it end so meet,
The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.
