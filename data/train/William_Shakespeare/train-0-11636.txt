ABERGAVENNY Is it therefore Th’ambassador is silenced? Marry is’t. ABERGAVENNY A proper title of a peace, and purchased
At a superfluous rate. Why, all this business Our reverend Cardinal carried. Like it your grace, The state takes notice of the private difference
Betwixt you and the Cardinal. I advise you—
And take it from a heart that wishes towards you
Honour and plenteous safety—that you read
The Cardinal’s malice and his potency
Together; to consider further that
What his high hatred would effect wants not
A minister in his power. You know his nature,
That he’s revengeful; and I know his sword
Hath a sharp edge—it’s long, and’t may be said no
It reaches far; and where ’twill not extend
Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel,
You’ll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock
That I advise your shunning.
