Sc. 13
Enter Pericles at Tarsus, with Cleon and Dionyza, and Lychorida with a babe Most honoured Cleon, I must needs be gone.
My twelve months are expired, and Tyrus stands
In a litigious peace. You and your lady
Take from my heart all thankfulness. The gods
Make up the rest upon you! CLEON Your strokes of fortune, Though they hurt you mortally, yet glance Full woundingly on us.
