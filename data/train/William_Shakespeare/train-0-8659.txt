GONORIL Milk-livered man, That bear‘st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;
Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning
Thine honour from thy suffering; that not know’st
Fools do those villains pity who are punished
Ere they have done their mischief: where’s thy drum?
France spreads his banners in our noiseless land,
With plumed helm thy flaxen biggin threats,
Whiles thou, a moral fool, sits still and cries
‘Alack, why does he so?’
