What, are you chafed? Ask God for temp’rance; that’s th’appliance only
Which your disease requires. I read in’s looks Matter against me, and his eye reviled
Me as his abject object. At this instant
He bores me with some trick. He’s gone to th’ King—
I’ll follow, and outstare him. Stay, my lord, And let your reason with your choler question
What ’tis you go about. To climb steep hills
Requires slow pace at first. Anger is like
A full hot horse who, being allowed his way,
Self-mettle tires him. Not a man in England
Can advise me like you. Be to yourself
As you would to your friend.
