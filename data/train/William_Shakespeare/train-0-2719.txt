PRINCE OF WALES Ay, that approves thee, tyrant, what thou art.
No father, king, or shepherd of thy realm,
But one that tears her entrails with thy hands
And, like a thirsty tiger, suckâ€™st her blood. You peers of France, why do you follow him
That is so prodigal to spend your lives? Whom should they follow, aged impotent,
But he that is their true-born sovereign?
