Remember your bold life, too. LORD CHANCELLOR This is too much. Forbear, for shame, my lords. I have done. LORD CHANCELLOR (to Cranmer) Then thus for you, my lord. It stands agreed,
I take it, by all voices, that forthwith
You be conveyed to th’ Tower a prisoner,
There to remain till the King’s further pleasure
Be known unto us. Are you all agreed, lords?
