This is he, Who hath upon him still that natural stamp.
It was wise nature’s end in the donation
To be his evidence now. O, what am I? A mother to the birth of three? Ne’er mother
Rejoiced deliverance more. Blest pray you be,
That, after this strange starting from your orbs,
You may reign in them now!
