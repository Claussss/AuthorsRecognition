Go, get thee hence, and find my dog again,
Or ne‘er return again into my sight.
Away, I say. Stay’st thou to vex me here? Exit Lance with Crab A slave, that still on end turns me to shame.
Sebastian, I have entertained thee
Partly that I have need of such a youth
That can with some discretion do my business,
For ’tis no trusting to yon foolish lout,
But chiefly for thy face and thy behaviour,
Which, if my augury deceive me not,
Witness good bringing up, fortune, and truth.
Therefore know thou, for this I entertain thee.
Go presently, and take this ring with thee.
Deliver it to Madam Silvia.
She loved me well delivered it to me.
