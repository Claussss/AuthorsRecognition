BRUTUS Away, slight man. CASSIUS Is’t possible? BRUTUS Hear me, for I will speak. Must I give way and room to your rash choler?
Shall I be frighted when a madman stares? O ye gods, ye gods! Must I endure all this? All this? Ay, more. Fret till your proud heart break.
Go show your slaves how choleric you are,
And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?
Must I observe you? Must I stand and crouch
Under your testy humour? By the gods,
You shall digest the venom of your spleen,
Though it do split you. For from this day forth
I’ll use you for my mirth, yea for my laughter,
When you are waspish.
