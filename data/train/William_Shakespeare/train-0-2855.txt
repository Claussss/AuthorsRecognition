LUCIANA Quoth who? DROMIO OF EPHESUS Quoth my master. ‘I know’, quoth he, ‘no house, no wife, no mistress.’
So that my errand, due unto my tongue,
I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders;
For, in conclusion, he did beat me there. Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home. DROMIO OF EPHESUS Go back again and be new beaten home?
For God’s sake, send some other messenger.
