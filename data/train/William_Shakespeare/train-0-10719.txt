O, my brother! Good gentleman, the wrongs I have done thee stir
Afresh within me, and these thy offices,
So rarely kind, are as interpreters
Of my behindhand slackness. Welcome hither,
As is the spring to th‘earth! And hath he too
Exposed this paragon to th’ fearful usage—
At least ungentle—of the dreadful Neptune
To greet a man not worth her pains, much less
Th’adventure of her person?
