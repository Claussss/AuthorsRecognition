 Alarum. Enter Brutus, Messala, young Cato,
 Strato, Volumnius, Lucillius, Labio, and Flavio Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie? Lo yonder, and Titinius mourning it. Titiniusâ€™ face is upward. CATO He is slain. O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet.
Thy spirit walks abroad, and turns our swords
In our own proper entrails.
