The skirmishes cease Bishop, I’ll be no breaker of the law.
But we shall meet and break our minds at large. Gloucester, we’ll meet to thy cost, be sure.
Thy heart-blood I will have for this day’s work. I’ll call for clubs, if you will not away.
(Aside) This bishop is more haughty than the devil. Mayor, farewell. Thou dost but what thou mayst.
