LORD BARDOLPH Sweet Earl, divorce not wisdom from your honour. The lives of all your loving complices
Lean on your health, the which, if you give o‘er
To stormy passion, must perforce decay.
You cast th’event of war, my noble lord,
And summed the account of chance, before you said
‘Let us make head’. It was your presurmise
That in the dole of blows your son might drop.
You knew he walked o‘er perils on an edge,
More likely to fall in than to get o’er.
You were advised his flesh was capable
Of wounds and scars, and that his forward spirit
Would lift him where most trade of danger ranged.
Yet did you say, ‘Go forth’; and none of this,
Though strongly apprehended, could restrain
The stiff-borne action. What hath then befall’n?
Or what doth this bold enterprise bring forth,
More than that being which was like to be?
