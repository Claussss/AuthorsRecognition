For my part, noble lords, I care not which:
Or Somerset or York, all’s one to me. If York have ill demeaned himself in France
Then let him be denied the regentship. If Somerset be unworthy of the place,
Let York be regent—I will yield to him. Whether your grace be worthy, yea or no,
Dispute not that: York is the worthier.
