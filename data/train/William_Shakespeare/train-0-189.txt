Leonard Digges (before 1636), in Shakespeare’s Poems (1640) 
In remembrance of Master William Shakespeare. Beware, delighted poets, when you sing
To welcome nature in the early spring,
Your num‘rous feet not tread
The banks of Avon; for each flower
(As it ne’er knew a sun or shower)
Hangs there the pensive head.
