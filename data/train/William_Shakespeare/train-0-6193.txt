ROSALIND Were it not better, Because that I am more than common tall,
That I did suit me all points like a man,
A gallant curtal-axe upon my thigh,
A boar-spear in my hand, and in my heart,
Lie there what hidden woman’s fear there will.
We’ll have a swashing and a martial outside,
As many other mannish cowards have,
That do outface it with their semblances.
