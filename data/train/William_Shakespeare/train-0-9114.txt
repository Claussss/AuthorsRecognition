Enter the Ghost of Banquo, and sits in Macbeth’s
place Sweet remembrancer. Now good digestion wait on appetite,
And health on both. May’t please your highness sit? Here had we now our country’s honour roofed
Were the graced person of our Banquo present,
Who may I rather challenge for unkindness
Than pity for mischance.
