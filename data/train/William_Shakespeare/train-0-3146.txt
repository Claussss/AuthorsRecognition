BIRON (aside) One drunkard loves another of the name. LONGUEVILLE Am I the first that have been perjured so? BIRON (aside) I could put thee in comfort, not by two that I know.
Thou makest the triumviry, the corner-cap of society,
The shape of loveâ€™s Tyburn, that hangs up simplicity. LONGUEVILLE I fear these stubborn lines lack power to move.
O sweet Maria, empress of my love,
These numbers will I tear, and write in prose.
