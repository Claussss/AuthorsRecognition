Very good, my lord. And then, sir, does a this—a does—
what was I about to say? By the mass, I was about to
say something. Where did I leave? At ‘closes in the consequence’, at ‘friend,
Or so’, and ‘gentleman’. At ‘closes in the consequence’—ay, marry,
He closes with you thus: ‘I know the gentleman,
I saw him yesterday’—or t‘other day,
Or then, or then—’with such and such, and, as you
say,
There was a gaming, there o‘ertook in ’s rouse,
There falling out at tennis’, or perchance
‘I saw him enter such a house of sale’,
Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth. See you now,
Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
And thus do we of wisdom and of reach
With windlasses and with assays of bias
By indirections find directions out.
So, by my former lecture and advice,
Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
