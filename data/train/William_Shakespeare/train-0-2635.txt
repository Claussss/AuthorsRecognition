Now, Lod‘wick, invocate some golden muse
To bring thee hither an enchanted pen
That may for sighs set down true sighs indeed,
Talking of grief, to make thee ready groan,
And when thou write’st of tears, encouch the word
Before and after with such sweet laments
That it may raise drops in a Tartar’s eye,
And make a flint-heart Scythian pitiful—
For so much moving hath a poet’s pen.
Then, if thou be a poet, move thou so
And be enriched by thy sovereign’s love.
For if the touch of sweet concordant strings
Could force attendance in the ears of hell,
How much more shall the strains of poets’ wit
Beguile and ravish soft and human minds?
