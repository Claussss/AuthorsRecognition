Enter King Lear and the Duke of Gloucester Deny to speak with me? They’re sick, they’re weary?
They travelled hard tonight?—mere insolence,
Ay, the images of revolt and flying off.
Fetch me a better answer. GLOUCESTER My dear lord, You know the fiery quality of the Duke,
How unremovable and fixed he is
In his own course.
