ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Good Lord! You use this dalliance to excuse
Your breach of promise to the Porcupine.
I should have chid you for not bringing it,
But like a shrew you first begin to brawl. SECOND MERCHANT (to Angelo) The hour steals on. I pray you, sir, dispatch. ANGELO (to Antipholus) You hear how he importunes me. The chain!
