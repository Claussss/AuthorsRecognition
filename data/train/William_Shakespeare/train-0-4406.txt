When I was with him I have heard him swear
To Tubal and to Cush, his countrymen,
That he would rather have Antonioâ€™s flesh
Than twenty times the value of the sum
That he did owe him; and I know, my lord,
If law, authority, and power deny not,
It will go hard with poor Antonio. PORTIA (to Bassanio) Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?
