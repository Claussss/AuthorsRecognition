This is, sir, a doubt In such a time nothing becoming you
Nor satisfying us. It is not likely That when they hear the Roman horses neigh,
Behold their quartered files, have both their eyes
And ears so cloyed importantly as now,
That they will waste their time upon our note,
To know from whence we are.
