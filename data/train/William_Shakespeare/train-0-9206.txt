Not so sick, my lord, As she is troubled with thick-coming fancies
That keep her from her rest. Cure her of that. Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased,
Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,
Raze out the written troubles of the brain,
And with some sweet oblivious antidote
Cleanse the fraught bosom of that perilous stuff
Which weighs upon the heart?
