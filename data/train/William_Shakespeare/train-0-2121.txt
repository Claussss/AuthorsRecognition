QUEEN ELIZABETH Ah that thou wouldst as soon afford a grave
As thou canst yield a melancholy seat.
Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here.
Ah, who hath any cause to mourn but we? QUEEN MARGARET (coming forward) If ancient sorrow be most reverend,
Give mine the benefit of seniory,
And let my griefs frown on the upper hand.
If sorrow can admit society,
Tell oâ€™er your woes again by viewing mine.
I had an Edward, till a Richard killed him;
I had a husband, till a Richard killed him.
(To Elizabeth) Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard killed him;
Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard killed him.
