 The Prince and Claudio promised by this hour
To visit me. You know your office, brother,
You must be father to your brotherâ€™s daughter,
And give her to young Claudio. Which I will do with confirmed countenance. Friar, I must entreat your pains, I think. FRIAR To do what, signor? To bind me or undo me, one of them.
Signor Leonato, truth it is, good signor,
Your niece regards me with an eye of favour.
