SECOND LORD He pours it out. Plutus the god of gold
Is but his steward; no meed but he repays
Sevenfold above itself; no gift to him
But breeds the giver a return exceeding
All use of quittance. FIRST LORD The noblest mind he carries That ever governed man. SECOND LORD Long may he live in fortunes! Shall we in?
