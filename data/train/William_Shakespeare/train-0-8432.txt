This wretch hath part confessed his villainy.
Did you and he consent in Cassioâ€™s death? OTHELLO Ay. Dear general, I never gave you cause. I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.

Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body? Demand me nothing. What you know, you know.
From this time forth I never will speak word.
