LAERTES Alas, then is she drowned. QUEEN GERTRUDE Drowned, drowned. Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
And therefore I forbid my tears. But yet
It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,  The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord.
I have a speech of fire that fain would blaze,
But that this folly douts it.
