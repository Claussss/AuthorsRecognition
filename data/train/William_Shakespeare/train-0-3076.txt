God bless my ladies, are they all in love,
That every one her own hath garnished
With such bedecking ornaments of praise? Here comes Boyet. Enter Boyet Now, what admittance, lord? Navarre had notice of your fair approach,
And he and his competitors in oath
Were all addressed to meet you, gentle lady,
Before I came. Marry, thus much I have learnt:
He rather means to lodge you in the field,
Like one that comes here to besiege his court,
Than seek a dispensation for his oath
To let you enter his unpeopled house.
