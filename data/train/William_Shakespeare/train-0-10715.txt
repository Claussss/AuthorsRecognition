Pardon, madam. The one I have almost forgotâ€”your pardon!
The other, when she has obtained your eye,
Will have your tongue too. This is a creature,
Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal
Of all professors else; make proselytes
Of who she but bid follow. How? Not women! Women will love her that she is a woman
More worth than any man; men, that she is
The rarest of all women.
