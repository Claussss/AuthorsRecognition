Well is he worthy of it, by my troth:
An honest, wise, well-spoken gentleman.
Yet would I praise his honesty much more
If he had kept his word and saved our lives.
But let that pass. Men are but men, and so
Words are but words, and pays not what men owe.
Now, husband, since perhaps the world may say
That through my means thou com’st thus to thy end,
Here I begin this cup of death to thee,
Because thou shalt be sure to taste no worse
Than I have taken that must go before thee.
What though I be a woman? That’s no matter.
I do owe God a death, and I must pay him.
Husband, give me thy hand. Be not dismayed.
This chore being chored, then all our debt is paid.
Only two little babes we leave behind us,
And all I can bequeath them at this time
Is but the love of some good honest friend
To bring them up in charitable sort.
What, masters?—He goes upright that never halts,
And they may live to mend their parents’ faults.
