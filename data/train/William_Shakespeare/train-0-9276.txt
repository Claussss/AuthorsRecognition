I should have known no less. It hath been taught us from the primal state
That he which is was wished until he were,
And the ebbed man, ne‘er loved till ne’er worth love,
Comes deared by being lacked. This common body,
Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,
Goes to, and back, lackeying the varying tide,
To rot itself with motion.
