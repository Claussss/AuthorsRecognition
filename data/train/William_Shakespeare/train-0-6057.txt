BRUTUS Cassius, be content. Speak your griefs softly. I do know you well.
Before the eyes of both our armies here,
Which should perceive nothing but love from us,
Let us not wrangle. Bid them move away,
Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,
And I will give you audience. CASSIUS Pindarus, Bid our commanders lead their charges off
A little from this ground.
