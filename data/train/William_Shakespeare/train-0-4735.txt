Exeunt Worcester [and Vernon] PRINCE HARRY It will not be accepted, on my life.
The Douglas and the Hotspur both together
Are confident against the world in arms. Hence, therefore, every leader to his charge,
For on their answer will we set on them,
And God befriend us as our cause is just! Exeunt all but Prince Harry and Oldcastle
