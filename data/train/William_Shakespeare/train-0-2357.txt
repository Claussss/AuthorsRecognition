She lifts the coffer-lids that close his eyes,
Where lo, two lamps burnt out in darkness lies; Two glasses, where herself herself beheld
A thousand times, and now no more reflect,
Their virtue lost, wherein they late excelled,
And every beauty robbed of his effect. ‘Wonder of time,’ quoth she, ‘this is my spite,
That, thou being dead, the day should yet be light.
