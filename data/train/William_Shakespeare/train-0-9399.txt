Let Rome be thus informed. Who, queasy with his insolence already,
Will their good thoughts call from him. The people knows it, And have now received his accusations. AGRIPPA Who does he accuse? Caesar, and that having in Sicily
Sextus Pompeius spoiled, we had not rated him
His part o’th’ isle. Then does he say he lent me
Some shipping, unrestored. Lastly, he frets
That Lepidus of the triumvirate
Should be deposed; and being, that we detain
All his revenue.
