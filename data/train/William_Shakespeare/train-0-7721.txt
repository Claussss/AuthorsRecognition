Good morrow to this fair assembly.
Come, my good lords, let’s sit. O serious square! Upon this little board is daily scanned
The health and preservation of the land,
We the physicians that effect this good,
Now by choice diet, anon by letting blood.
Our toil and careful watching brings the King
In league with slumbers, to which peace doth sing.—
Avoid the room there!—
What business, lords, today?
