Than you can put us to’t. No longer stay. One sennight longer. Very sooth, tomorrow. We’ll part the time between’s, then; and in that
I’ll no gainsaying. Press me not, beseech you, so. There is no tongue that moves, none, none i‘th’ world
So soon as yours, could win me. So it should now,
Were there necessity in your request, although
’Twere needful I denied it. My affairs
Do even drag me homeward; which to hinder
Were, in your love, a whip to me; my stay
To you a charge and trouble. To save both,
Farewell, our brother.
