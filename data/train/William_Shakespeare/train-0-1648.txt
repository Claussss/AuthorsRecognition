Exeunt all but Titus I am not bid to wait upon this bride.
Titus, when wert thou wont to walk alone,
Dishonoured thus and challenged of wrongs? Enter Marcus and Titus’ sons Lucius, Quintus, and
Martius, carrying Mutius’ body O Titus, see, O see what thou hast done—
In a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son.
