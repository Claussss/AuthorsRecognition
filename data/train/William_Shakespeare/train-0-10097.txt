You will scarce believe me. ‘Twere best I did give o’er. I will believe you by the syllable
Of what you shall deliver. Yet give me leave.
How came you in these parts? Where were you bred? The King my father did in Tarsus leave me,
Till cruel Cleon, with his wicked wife,
Did seek to murder me, and wooed a villain
To attempt the deed; who having drawn to do’t,
A crew of pirates came and rescued me.
To Mytilene they brought me. But, good sir,
What will you of me? Why do you weep? It may be
You think me an impostor. No, good faith,
I am the daughter to King Pericles,
If good King Pericles be.
