BIONDELLO I sir? Ne’er a whit. And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth.
Tranio is changed into Lucentio. The better for him. Would I were so too. So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after—
That Lucentio indeed had Baptista’s youngest
daughter.
But sirrah, not for my sake but your master’s I advise
You use your manners discreetly in all kind of
companies.
When I am alone, why then I am Tranio,
But in all places else your master, Lucentio.
