I must indeed, and therefore came I hither.
Good gentle youth, tempt not a desp’rate man.
Fly hence, and leave me. Think upon these gone. 60
Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
Put not another sin upon my head
By urging me to fury. O, be gone.
By heaven, I love thee better than myself,
For I come hither armed against myself. 65
Stay not, be gone. Live, and hereafter say
A madman’s mercy bid thee run away.
