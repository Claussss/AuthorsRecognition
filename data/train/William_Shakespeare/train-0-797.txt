SALISBURY and WARWICK (kneeling) Long live our sovereign Richard, England’s king! We thank you, lords;
Salisbury and Warwick rise
but I am not your king
Till I be crowned, and that my sword be stained
With heart-blood of the house of Lancaster—
And that’s not suddenly to be performed,
But with advice and silent secrecy.
Do you, as I do, in these dangerous days,
Wink at the Duke of Suffolk’s insolence,
At Beaufort’s pride, at Somerset’s ambition,
At Buckingham, and all the crew of them,
Till they have snared the shepherd of the flock,
That virtuous prince, the good Duke Humphrey.
