Spurns at his love, and scorns the heat he feels,
Beating his kind embracements with her heels. Then, like a melancholy malcontent,
He vails his tail that, like a falling plume,
Cool shadow to his melting buttock lent.
He stamps, and bites the poor flies in his fume. His love, perceiving how he was enraged,
Grew kinder, and his fury was assuaged.
