5.3
Enter Leontes, Polixenes, Florizel, Perdita, Camillo, Paulina, Lords, and attendants O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort
That I have had of thee! What, sovereign sir, I did not well, I meant well. All my services
You have paid home, but that you have vouchsafed
With your crowned brother and these young
contracted
Heirs of your kingdoms my poor house to visit,
It is a surplus of your grace which never
My life may last to answer.
