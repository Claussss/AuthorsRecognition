Nay, my lord, That cannot be. You are a Councillor,
And by that virtue no man dare accuse you. GARDINER (to Cranmer) My lord, because we have business of more moment,
We will be short with you. ’Tis his highness’ pleasure
And our consent, for better trial of you,
From hence you be committed to the Tower
Where, being but a private man again,
You shall know many dare accuse you boldly,
More than, I fear, you are provided for.
