O where, my lord? In my mindâ€™s eye, Horatio. I saw him once. A was a goodly king. A was a man. Take him for all in all,
I shall not look upon his like again. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight. HAMLET Saw? Who? HORATIO My lord, the King your father. HAMLET The King my father? Season your admiration for a while
With an attent ear till I may deliver,
Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
This marvel to you.
