Lie blist’ring fore the visitating sun,
And were good kings, when living. It is true, And I will give you comfort to give your dead lords
graves,
The which to do must make some work with Creon. FIRST QUEEN And that work presents itself to th’ doing.
Now ’twill take form, the heats are gone tomorrow.
Then, bootless toil must recompense itself
With its own sweat; now he’s secure,
Not dreams we stand before your puissance
Rinsing our holy begging in our eyes
To make petition clear.
