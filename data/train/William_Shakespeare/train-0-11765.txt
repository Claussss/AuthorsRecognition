CARDINAL CAMPEIUS I would your grace Would leave your griefs and take my counsel. QUEEN KATHERINE CARDINAL CAMPEIUS Put your main cause into the King’s protection.
He’s loving and most gracious. ’Twill be much
Both for your honour better and your cause,
For if the trial of the law o’ertake ye
You’ll part away disgraced.
