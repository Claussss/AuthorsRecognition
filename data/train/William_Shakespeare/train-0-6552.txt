PLAYER KING (to Player Queen) â€™Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here a while.
My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
The tedious day with sleep. PLAYER QUEEN Sleep rock thy brain, And never come mischance between us twain. Player King sleeps. Player Queen exits HAMLET (to Gertrude) Madam, how like you this play?
