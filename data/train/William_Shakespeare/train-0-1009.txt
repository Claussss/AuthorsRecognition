Alarums. They fight. York kills Clifford Now, Lancaster, sit sure—thy sinews shrink.
Come, fearful Henry, grovelling on thy face—
Yield up thy crown unto the prince of York. Exit Alarums, then enter Young Clifford YOUNG CLIFFORD Shame and confusion, all is on the rout!
Fear frames disorder, and disorder wounds
Where it should guard. O, war, thou son of hell,
Whom angry heavens do make their minister,
Throw in the frozen bosoms of our part
Hot coals of vengeance! Let no soldier fly!
He that is truly dedicate to war
Hath no self-love; nor he that loves himself
Hath not essentially, but by circumstance,
The name of valour.
