Enter Robin Goodfellow, the puck
ROBIN Captain of our fairy band,
Helena is here at hand,
And the youth mistook by me,
Pleading for a lover’s fee.
Shall we their fond pageant see?
Lord, what fools these mortals be! Stand aside. The noise they make
Will cause Demetrius to awake. Then will two at once woo one.
That must needs be sport alone;
And those things do best please me
That befall prepost’rously.
