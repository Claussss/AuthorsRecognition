Why, say, fair Queen, whence springs this deep despair ? QUEEN MARGARET From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
And stops my tongue, while heart is drowned in cares. Whate’er it be, be thou still like thyself,
And sit thee by our side. Seats her by him
Yield not thy neck To fortune’s yoke, but let thy dauntless mind
Still ride in triumph over all mischance.
Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief.
It shall be eased if France can yield relief.
