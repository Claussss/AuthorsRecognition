You wronged yourself to write in such a case. In such a time as this it is not meet
That every nice offence should bear his comment. Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself
Are much condemned to have an itching palm,
To sell and mart your offices for gold
To undeservers. CASSIUS I, an itching palm? You know that you are Brutus that speaks this, 65
Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.
