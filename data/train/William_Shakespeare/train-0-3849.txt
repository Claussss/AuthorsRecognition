I frown upon him, yet he loves me still. O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill! I give him curses, yet he gives me love. O that my prayers could such affection move! The more I hate, the more he follows me. The more I love, the more he hateth me. His folly, Helen, is no fault of mine. None but your beauty; would that fault were mine!
