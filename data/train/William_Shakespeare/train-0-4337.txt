2.3
Enter Jessica and Lancelot., the clown I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so.
Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil,
Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness.
But fare thee well. There is a ducat for thee.
And, Lancelot, soon at supper shalt thou see
Lorenzo, who is thy new masterâ€™s guest.
Give him this letter, do it secretly;
And so farewell. I would not have my father
See me in talk with thee.
