Away, and let me die. Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,
So many fathom down precipitating
Thou‘dst shivered like an egg. But thou dost breathe,
Hast heavy substance, bleed’st not, speak’st, art sound.
Ten masts a-length make not the altitude
Which thou hast perpendicularly fell.
Thy life’s a miracle. Speak yet again.
