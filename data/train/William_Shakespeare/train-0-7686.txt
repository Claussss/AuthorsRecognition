We will, my lord. Exeunt Servingmen and Player Where are the waits? [To Roper] Go, bid them play,
To spend the time a while. Enter Lady More How now, madam? My lord, they’re coming hither. They’re welcome. Wife, I’ll tell ye one thing.
Our sport is somewhat mended: we shall have
A play tonight, The Marriage of Wit and Wisdom,
And acted by my good Lord Cardinal’s players.
How like ye that, wife?
