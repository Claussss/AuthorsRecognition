CELIA Didst thou hear these verses? ROSALIND O yes, I heard them all, and more, too, for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear. CELIA Thatâ€™s no matter; the feet might bear the verses. ROSALIND Ay, but the feet were lame, and could not bear themselves without the verse, and therefore stood lamely in the verse.
