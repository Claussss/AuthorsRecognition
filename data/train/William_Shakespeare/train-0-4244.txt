A friend. What art thou? HUBERT Of the part of England. Whither dost thou go? HUBERT What’s that to thee? Why may not I demand of thine affairs
As well as thou of mine? BASTARD Hubert, I think. HUBERT Thou hast a perfect thought. I will upon all hazards well believe
Thou art my friend that know’st my tongue so well.
Who art thou?
