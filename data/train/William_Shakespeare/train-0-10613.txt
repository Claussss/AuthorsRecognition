AUTOLYCUS (grovelling
on the ground) O, that ever I was born! CLOWN I’th’ name of me! AUTOLYCUS O help me, help me! Pluck but off these rags, and then death, death! CLOWN Alack, poor soul, thou hast need of more rags to lay on thee rather than have these off. AUTOLYCUS O sir, the loathsomeness of them offend me more than the stripes I have received, which are mighty ones and millions.
