You talk of me, sir— Alas, I am a puny. There’s one, indeed,
Goes by my name; he puts down all for purses Be as familiar as thou wilt, my knave.
’Tis this I long to know. LIFTER (aside) And you shall have your longing ere ye go.—
This fellow, sir, perhaps will meet ye thus,
Action of greeting him
Or thus, or thus, and in kind compliment
Pretend acquaintance, somewhat doubtfully,
And these embraces serve.
