3.2
Enter the Duke of Norfolk, the Duke of Suffolk, Lord Surrey, and the Lord Chamberlain If you will now unite in your complaints,
And force them with a constancy, the Cardinal
Cannot stand under them. If you omit
The offer of this time, I cannot promise
But that you shall sustain more new disgraces
With these you bear already.
