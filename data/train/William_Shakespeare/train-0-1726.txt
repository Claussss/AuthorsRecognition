I go, Andronicus; and for thy hand
Look by and by to have thy sons with thee.
(Aside) Their heads, I mean. O, how this villainy
Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it!
Let fools do good, and fair men call for grace:
Aaron will have his soul black like his face. Exit O, here I lift this one hand up to heaven
And bow this feeble ruin to the earth.
