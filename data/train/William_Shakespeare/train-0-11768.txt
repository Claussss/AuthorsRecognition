CARDINAL CAMPEIUS Your fears are worse. QUEEN KATHERINE Have I lived thus long—let me speak myself,
Since virtue finds no friends—a wife, a true one?
A woman, I dare say, without vainglory,
Never yet branded with suspicion?
Have I with all my full affections
Still met the King, loved him next heav‘n, obeyed him,
Been out of fondness superstitious to him,
Almost forgot my prayers to content him?
And am I thus rewarded? ’Tis not well, lords.
Bring me a constant woman to her husband,
One that ne’er dreamed a joy beyond his pleasure,
And to that woman when she has done most,
Yet will I add an honour, a great patience.
