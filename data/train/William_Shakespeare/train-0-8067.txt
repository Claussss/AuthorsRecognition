LUCIO My lord, she may be a punk, for many of them are neither maid, widow, nor wife. DUKE Silence that fellow. I would he had some cause to prattle for himself. LUCIO Well, my lord. My lord, I do confess I neâ€™er was married,
And I confess besides, I am no maid.
I have known my husband, yet my husband
Knows not that ever he knew me.
