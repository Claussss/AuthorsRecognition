ALL THREE (to Richmond) Awake, and think our wrongs in Richard’s bosom
Will conquer him. Awake, and win the day! Exeunt Ghosts Dream on thy cousins, smothered in the Tower.
Let us be lead within thy bosom, Richard,
And weigh thee down to ruin, shame, and death.
Thy nephews’ souls bid thee despair and die.
(To Richmond) Sleep, Richmond, sleep in peace and wake in joy.
Good angels guard thee from the boar’s annoy.
Live, and beget a happy race of kings!
Edward’s unhappy sons do bid thee flourish.
