CARDINAL WOLSEY Madam, this is a mere distraction.
You turn the good we offer into envy. QUEEN KATHERINE Ye turn me into nothing. Woe upon ye,
And all such false professors. Would you have me—
If you have any justice, any pity,
If ye be anything but churchmen’s habits—
Put my sick cause into his hands that hates me?
Alas, he’s banished me his bed already—
His love, too, long ago. I am old, my lords,
And all the fellowship I hold now with him
Is only my obedience. What can happen
To me above this wretchedness? All your studies
Make me accursed like this.
