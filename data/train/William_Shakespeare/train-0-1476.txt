The English whisper together in counsel God speed the parliament; who shall be the Speaker? Dare ye come forth and meet us in the field? Belike your lordship takes us then for fools,
To try if that our own be ours or no. I speak not to that railing Hecate
But unto thee, Alen
Will ye, like soldiers, come and fight it out?
