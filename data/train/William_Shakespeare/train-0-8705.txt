I know thee well—a serviceable villain,
As duteous to the vices of thy mistress
As badness would desire. GLOUCESTER What, is he dead? EDGAR Sit you down, father. Rest you. Gloucester sits Let’s see his pockets. These letters that he speaks of

To know our enemies’ minds we’d rip their hearts;
Their papers is more lawful.
