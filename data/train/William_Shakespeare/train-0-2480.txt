‘Misshapen time, copesmate of ugly night,
Swift subtle post, carrier of grisly care,
Eater of youth, false slave to false delight,
Base watch of woes, sin’s pack-horse, virtue’s snare,
Thou nursest all, and murd’rest all that are. O hear me then, injurious shifting time;
Be guilty of my death, since of my crime.
