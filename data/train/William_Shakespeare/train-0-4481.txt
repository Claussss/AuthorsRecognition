Enter Portia and Nerissa, as themselves That light we see is burning in my hall. How far that little candle throws his beamsâ€”
So shines a good deed in a naughty world. When the moon shone we did not see the candle. So doth the greater glory dim the less. A substitute shines brightly as a king
Until a king be by, and then his state
Empties itself as doth an inland brook
Into the main of waters. Music, hark.
