RICHARD DUKE OF YORK (rising) And so thrive Richard, as thy foes may fall;
And as my duty springs, so perish they
That grudge one thought against your majesty. ALL BUT RICHARD AND SOMERSET Welcome, high prince, the mighty Duke of York! SOMERSET (aside) Perish, base prince, ignoble Duke of York! Now will it best avail your majesty
To cross the seas and to be crowned in France.
The presence of a king engenders love
Amongst his subjects and his loyal friends,
As it disanimates his enemies.
