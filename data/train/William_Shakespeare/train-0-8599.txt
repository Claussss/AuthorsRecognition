He that has a little tiny wit,
With heigh-ho, the wind and the rain,
Must make content with his fortunes fit,
For the rain it raineth every day. True, my good boy. (To Kent) Come, bring us to this hovel. Exeunt Sc. 10
Enter the Duke of Gloucester and Edmund the bastard, with lights 
GLOUCESTER Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this
Unnatural dealing. When I desired their leave
That I might pity him, they took from me
The use of mine own house, charged me on pain
Of their displeasure neither to speak of him,
Entreat for him, nor any way sustain him.
