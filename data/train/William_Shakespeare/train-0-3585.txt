A man, young lady, lady, such a man
As all the world—why, he’s a man of wax. CAPULET’S WIFE Verona’s summer hath not such a flower. Nay, he’s a flower, in faith, a very flower. CAPULET’S WIFE (to Juliet) What say you ? Can you love the gentleman ?
This night you shall behold him at our feast.
Read o‘er the volume of young Paris’ face,
And find delight writ there with beauty’s pen.
Examine every married lineament,
And see how one another lends content;
And what obscured in this fair volume lies
Find written in the margin of his eyes.
This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
To beautify him only lacks a cover.
The fish lives in the sea, and ’tis much pride
For fair without the fair within to hide.
That book in many’s eyes doth share the glory
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story.
So shall you share all that he doth possess
By having him, making yourself no less.
