You gods, look down, And from your sacred vials pour your graces
Upon my daughter’s head.—Tell me, mine own,
Where hast thou been preserved? Where lived? How
found
Thy father’s court? For thou shalt hear that I,
Knowing by Paulina that the oracle
Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserved
Myself to see the issue.
