OTHELLO Farewell, farewell. If more thou dost perceive, let me know more.
Set on thy wife to observe. Leave me, Iago. IAGO (going) My lord, I take my leave. Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless
Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds. IAGO (returning) My lord, I would I might entreat your honour
To scan this thing no farther. Leave it to time.
Although ’tis fit that Cassio have his place—
For sure he fills it up with great ability—
Yet, if you please to hold him off a while,
You shall by that perceive him and his means.
Note if your lady strain his entertainment
With any strong or vehement importunity.
Much will be seen in that. In the mean time,
Let me be thought too busy in my fears—
As worthy cause I have to fear I am—
And hold her free, I do beseech your honour.
