Yes, sir, as well as you dare patronage
The envious barking of your saucy tongue
Against my lord the Duke of Somerset. Sirrah, thy lord I honour as he is. Why, what is he?—as good a man as York. Hark ye, not so. In witness, take ye that. Vernon strikes him Villain, thou know‘st the law of arms is such
That whoso draws a sword ’tis present death,
Or else this blow should broach thy dearest blood.
But I’ll unto his majesty and crave
I may have liberty to venge this wrong,
When thou shalt see I’ll meet thee to thy cost.
