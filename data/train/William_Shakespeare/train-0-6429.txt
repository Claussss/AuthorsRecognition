I warrant you it will. If it assume my noble father’s person
I’ll speak to it though hell itself should gape
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
If you have hitherto concealed this sight,
Let it be treble in your silence still,
And whatsoever else shall hap tonight,
Give it an understanding but no tongue.
I will requite your loves. So fare ye well.
Upon the platform ’twixt eleven and twelve
I’ll visit you.
