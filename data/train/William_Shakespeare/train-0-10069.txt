MARINA The good gods preserve you! The very doors and windows savour vilely.
Fare thee well. Thou art a piece of virtue,
The best wrought up that ever nature made,
And I doubt not thy training hath been noble.
A curse upon him, die he like a thief,
That robs thee of thy honour. Hold, hereâ€™s more gold.
If thou dost hear from me, it shall be for thy good.
