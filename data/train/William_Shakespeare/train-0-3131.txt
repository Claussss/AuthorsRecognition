NATHANIEL Perge, good Master Holofernes, perge, so it shall please you to abrogate scurrility. HOLOFERNES I will something affect the letter, for it argues facility. The preyful Princess pierced and pricked a pretty pleasing pricket.
Some say a sore, but not a sore till now made sore with shooting.
The dogs did yell; put ‘I’ to ‘sore‘, then ‘sorel’ jumps from thicket—
Or pricket sore, or else sorel. The people fall a- hooting.
If sore be sore, then ‘I’ to ‘sore’ makes fifty sores—O sore ‘I’!
Of one sore I an hundred make by adding but one more ‘I’.
