This Edmund, in the reign of Bolingbroke,
As I have read, laid claim unto the crown,
And, but for Owain Glyndwr, had been king,
Who kept him in captivity till he died.
But to the rest. YORK His eldest sister, Anne, My mother, being heir unto the crown,
Married Richard, Earl of Cambridge, who was son
To Edmund Langley, Edward the Thirdâ€™s fifth son.
By her I claim the kingdom: she was heir
To Roger, Earl of March, who was the son
Of Edmund Mortimer, who married Phillipe,
Sole daughter unto Lionel, Duke of Clarence.
So if the issue of the elder son
Succeed before the younger, I am king.
