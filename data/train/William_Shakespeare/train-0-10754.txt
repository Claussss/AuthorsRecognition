The ruddiness upon her lip is wet.
You’ll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own
With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain? No, not these twenty years. So long could I Stand by, a looker-on. Either forbear, Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you
For more amazement. If you can behold it,
I’ll make the statue move indeed, descend,
And take you by the hand. But then you’ll think—
Which I protest against—I am assisted
By wicked powers.
