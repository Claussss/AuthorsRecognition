What, my old client, art thou got hither too?
Poor silly wretch, I must confess indeed
I had such writings as concern thee near,
But the King
Has ta’en the matter into his own hand;
He has all I had. Then, woman, sue to him.
I cannot help thee. Thou must bear with me. Ah, gentle heart, my soul for thee is sad.
Farewell, the best friend that the poor e’er had.
