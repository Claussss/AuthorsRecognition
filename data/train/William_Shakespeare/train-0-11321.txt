He disrobes himself So I’ll fight
Against the part I come with; so I’ll die
For thee, O Innogen, even for whom my life
Is every breath a death; and, thus unknown,
Pitied nor hated, to the face of peril
Myself I’ll dedicate. Let me make men know
More valour in me than my habits show.
Gods, put the strength o‘th’ Leonati in me.
To shame the guise o’th’ world, I will begin
The fashion-less without and more within. Exit
