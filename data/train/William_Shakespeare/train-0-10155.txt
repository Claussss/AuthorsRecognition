BRUTUS Let’s along. Exeunt 1.2 Enter Aufidius, with Senators of Corioles FIRST SENATOR So, your opinion is, Aufidius,
That they of Rome are entered in our counsels
And know how we proceed. Is it not yours? What ever have been thought on in this state
That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome
Had circumvention? ’Tis not four days gone
Since I heard thence. These are the words. I think
I have the letter here—yes, here it is.
