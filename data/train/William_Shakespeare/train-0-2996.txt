Peace, fool. Thy master and his man are here,
And that is false thou dost report to us. Mistress, upon my life I tell you true.
I have not breathed almost since I did see it.
He cries for you, and vows, if he can take you,
To scorch your face and to disfigure you. Hark, hark, I hear him, mistress. Fly, be gone!
