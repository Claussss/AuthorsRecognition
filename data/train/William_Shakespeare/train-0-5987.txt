LUCIUS Madam, what should I do? Run to the Capitol, and nothing else?
And so return to you, and nothing else? Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well,
For he went sickly forth; and take good note
What Caesar doth, what suitors press to him.
Hark, boy, what noise is that? LUCIUS I hear none, madam.
