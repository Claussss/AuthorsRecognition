Exit Montfort Now, if I knew but safely how to pass,
I would at Calais gladly meet his grace,
Whither I am by letters certified
That he intends to have his host removed.
It shall be so. This policy will serve.
(Calling) Ho, who’s within? Bring Villiers to me. Enter Villiers Villiers, thou know’st thou art my prisoner,
And that I might for ransom, if I would,
Require of thee a hundred thousand francs,
Or else retain and keep thee captive still.
But so it is that for a smaller charge
Thou mayst be quit, an if thou wilt thyself.
And this it is: procure me but a passport
Of Charles, the Duke of Normandy, that I
Without restraint may have recourse to Calais
Through all the countries where he hath to do—
Which thou mayst easily obtain, I think,
By reason I have often heard thee say
He and thou were students once together—
And then thou shalt be set at liberty.
How sayst thou? Wilt thou undertake to do it?
