Good night, good night. God me such uses send
Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend! Exeunt 5.1
Enter Iago and Roderigo Here, stand behind this bulk. Straight will he come.
Wear thy good rapier bare, and put it home.
Quick, quick, fear nothing. Iâ€™ll be at thy elbow.
It makes us or it mars us. Think on that,
And fix most firm thy resolution.
