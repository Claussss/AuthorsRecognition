Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find
Not myself disposed to sleep. Nor I; my spirits are nimble. They fell together all, as by consent;
They dropped as by a thunderstroke. What might,
Worthy Sebastian, O, what might—? No more!—
And yet methinks I see it in thy face.
What thou shouldst be th’occasion speaks thee, and
My strong imagination sees a crown
Dropping upon thy head.
