Pindarus takes the sword  And when my face is covered, as â€™tis now,
Guide thou the sword. Pindarus stabs him  Caesar, thou art revenged,
Even with the sword that killed thee. So, I am free, yet would not so have been
Durst I have done my will. O Cassius!
Far from this country Pindarus shall run,
Where never Roman shall take note of him.
