You touched my vein at first. The thorny point
Of bare distress hath taâ€™en from me the show
Of smooth civility. Yet am I inland bred,
And know some nurture. But forbear, I say.
He dies that touches any of this fruit
Till I and my affairs are answered. JAQUES An you will not be answered with reason, I must die.
