APEMANTUS Beast! TIMON Slave! APEMANTUS Toad! TIMON Rogue, rogue, rogue! I am sick of this false world, and will love naught
But even the mere necessities upon’t.
Then, Timon, presently prepare thy grave.
Lie where the light foam of the sea may beat
Thy gravestone daily. Make thine epitaph,
That death in me at others’ lives may laugh.
