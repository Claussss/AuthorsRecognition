MISTRESS QUICKLY Godâ€™s blessing of your good heart, and so she is, by my troth! SIR JOHN (to Prince Harry) Didst thou hear me? PRINCE HARRY Yea, and you knew me as you did when you ran away by Gads Hill; you knew I was at your back, and spoke it on purpose to try my patience. SIR JOHN No, no, no, not so, I did not think thou wast within hearing.
