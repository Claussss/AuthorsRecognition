Enter Cromwell, who then stands amazed Why, how now, Cromwell? I have no power to speak, sir. CARDINAL WOLSEY What, amazed At my misfortunes? Can thy spirit wonder
A great man should decline? Cromwell begins to weep Nay, an you weep I am fall’n indeed. How does your grace? CARDINAL WOLSEY Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell.
I know myself now, and I feel within me
A peace above all earthly dignities,
A still and quiet conscience. The King has cured me.
I humbly thank his grace, and from these shoulders,
These ruined pillars, out of pity, taken
A load would sink a navy—too much honour.
O, ’tis a burden, Cromwell, ’tis a burden
Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven.
