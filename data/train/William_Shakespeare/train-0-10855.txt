But where is he? Look, sir, I bleed. Where is the villain, Edmond? Fled this way, sir, when by no means he could— Pursue him, ho! Go after. Exeunt servants By no means what? Persuade me to the murder of your lordship,
But that I told him the revenging gods
‘Gainst parricides did all the thunder bend,
Spoke with how manifold and strong a bond
The child was bound to th’ father. Sir, in fine,
Seeing how loathly opposite I stood
To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion
With his prepared sword he charges home
My unprovided body, latched mine arm;
And when he saw my best alarumed spirits
Bold in the quarrel’s right, roused to th’encounter,
Or whether ghasted by the noise I made,
Full suddenly he fled.
