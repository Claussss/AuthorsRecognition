Alas, my lord, How can she be with him? When was she missed?
He is in Rome. Where is she, sir? Come nearer. No farther halting. Satisfy me home
What is become of her. PISANIO O my all-worthy lord! CLOTEN All-worthy villain, Discover where thy mistress is at once,
At the next word. No more of ‘worthy lord’.
Speak, or thy silence on the instant is
Thy condemnation and thy death.
