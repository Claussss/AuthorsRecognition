No man inveigh against the withered flower,
But chide rough winter that the flower hath killed.
Not that devoured, but that which doth devour
Is worthy blame. O, let it not be held
Poor women’s faults that they are so full-filled With men’s abuses. Those proud lords, to blame,
Make weak-made women tenants to their shame.
