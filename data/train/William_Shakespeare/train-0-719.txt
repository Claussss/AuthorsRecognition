I go. Come, Nell, thou wilt ride with us ? Yes, my good lord, I’ll follow presently. Exeunt Gloucester and the Messenger Follow I must; I cannot go before
While Gloucester bears this base and humble mind.
Were I am an, a duke, and next of blood,
I would remove these tedious stumbling blocks
And smooth my way upon their headless necks.
And, being a woman, I will not be slack
To play my part in fortune’s pageant.
(Calling within) Where are you there? Sir John! Nay,
fear not man.
We are alone. Here’s none but thee and I.
Enter Sir John Hume
