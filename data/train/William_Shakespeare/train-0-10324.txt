MENENIUS Return to th’ tribunes. CORIOLANUS Well, what then, what then? MENENIUS Repent what you have spoke. For them? I cannot do it to the gods.
Must I then do’t to them? You are too absolute, Though therein you can never be too noble,
But when extremities speak. I have heard you say,
Honour and policy, like unsevered friends,
I’th’ war do grow together. Grant that, and tell me
In peace what each of them by th’ other lose
That they combine not there.
