Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows
Which shows like grief itself but is not so.
For sorrow’s eye, glazed with blinding tears,
Divides one thing entire to many objects—
Like perspectives, which, rightly gazed upon,
Show nothing but confusion; eyed awry,
Distinguish form. So your sweet majesty,
Looking awry upon your lord’s departure,
Find shapes of grief more than himself to wail,
Which, looked on as it is, is naught but shadows
Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious Queen,
More than your lord’s departure weep not: more is not seen,
Or if it be, ’tis with false sorrow’s eye,
Which for things true weeps things imaginary.
