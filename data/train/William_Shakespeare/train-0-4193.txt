KING JOHN Gentle kinsman, go And thrust thyself into their companies.
I have away to win their loves again.
Bring them before me. BASTARD I will seek them out. Nay, but make haste, the better foot before.
O, let me have no subject enemies
When adverse foreigners affright my towns
With dreadful pomp of stout invasion!
Be Mercury, set feathers to thy heels,
And fly like thought from them to me again. 175
