Ay, for the state, not for Antonio. Nay, take my life and all, pardon not that. You take my house when you do take the prop
That doth sustain my house; you take my life
When you do take the means whereby I live. What mercy can you render him, Antonio? A halter, gratis. Nothing else, for Godâ€™s sake. So please my lord the Duke and all the court
To quit the fine for one half of his goods,
I am content, so he will let me have
The other half in use, to render it
Upon his death unto the gentleman
That lately stole his daughter.
Two things provided more: that for this favour
He presently become a Christian;
The other, that he do record a gift
Here in the court of all he dies possessed
Unto his son, Lorenzo, and his daughter.
