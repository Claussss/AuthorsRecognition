Report, my lord, hath crossed the narrow seas,
And to the several parts of Christendom
Hath borne the fame of your Lord Chancellor.
I longed to see him whom with loving thoughts
I in my study oft have visited.
Is yon Sir Thomas? It is, Erasmus. Now do you view the honourablest scholar,
The most religious politician,
The worthiest counsellor, that tends our state.
That study is the general watch of England.
In it, the Princeâ€™s safety and the peace
That shines upon our commonwealth are forged
Upon the golden anvil of his brain.
Who cures the realm, such care attends the great
That mind and body must together sweat.
