And give it to this fellow.—Keep it, fellow,
And wear it for an honour in thy cap
Till I do challenge it.—Give him the crowns.

FLUELLEN By this day and this light, the fellow has mettle enough in his betty.—Ho[d, there is twelve pence for you, and I pray you to serve God, and keep you out of prawls and prabbles and quarrels and dissensions, and I warrant you it is the better for you.
