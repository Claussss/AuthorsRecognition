QUEEN ELIZABETH How canst thou woo her? KING RICHARD That would I learn of you, As one being best acquainted with her humour. QUEEN ELIZABETH And wilt thou learn of me? KING RICHARD Madam, with all my heart. QUEEN ELIZABETH Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers,
A pair of bleeding hearts; thereon engrave
‘Edward’ and ‘York’; then haply will she weep.
Therefore present to her—as sometimes Margaret
Did to thy father, steeped in Rutland’s blood—
A handkerchief which, say to her, did drain
The purple sap from her sweet brother’s body,
And bid her wipe her weeping eyes withal.
If this inducement move her not to love,
Send her a letter of thy noble deeds.
Tell her thou mad’st away her uncle Clarence,
Her uncle Rivers—ay, and for her sake
Mad’st quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.
