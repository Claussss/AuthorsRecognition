CORIOLANUS (to Young Martius) The god of soldiers, With the consent of supreme Jove, inform
Thy thoughts with nobleness, that thou mayst prove
To shame unvulnerable, and stick i’th’ wars
Like a great sea-mark standing every flaw
And saving those that eye thee! VOLUMNIA (to Young Martius) Your knee, sirrah.
