What should he be? It is myself I mean, in whom I know
All the particulars of vice so grafted
That when they shall be opened black Macbeth
Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state
Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
With my confineless harms. Not in the legions Of horrid hell can come a devil more damned
In evils to top Macbeth.
