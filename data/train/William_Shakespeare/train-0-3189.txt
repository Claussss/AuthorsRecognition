What’s your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word? A light condition in a beauty dark. We need more light to find your meaning out. You’ll mar the light by taking it in snuff,
Therefore I’ll darkly end the argument. Look what you do, you do it still i’th’ dark. So do not you, for you are a light wench.
