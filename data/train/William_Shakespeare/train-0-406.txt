I thank your grace. The gift hath made me happy.
I now beseech you, for your daughter’s sake,
To grant one boon that I shall ask of you. I grant it, for thine own, whate’er it be. These banished men that I have kept withal
Are men endowed with worthy qualities.
Forgive them what they have committed here,
And let them be recalled from their exile.
They are reformed, civil, full of good,
And fit for great employment, worthy lord.
