I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost. There are some shrewd contents in yon same paper
That steals the colour from Bassanioâ€™s cheek.
Some dear friend dead, else nothing in the world
Could turn so much the constitution
Of any constant man. What, worse and worse?
With leave, Bassanio, I am half yourself,
And I must freely have the half of anything
That this same paper brings you.
