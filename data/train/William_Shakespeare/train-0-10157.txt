FIRST SENATOR Our armyâ€™s in the field. We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready
To answer us. AUFIDIUS Nor did you think it folly To keep your great pretences veiled till when
They needs must show themselves, which in the
hatching,
It seemed, appeared to Rome. By the discovery
We shall be shortened in our aim, which was
To take in many towns ere, almost, Rome
Should know we were afoot.
