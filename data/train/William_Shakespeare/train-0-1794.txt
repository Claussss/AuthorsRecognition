O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil
That robbed Andronicus of his good hand.
This is the pearl that pleased your Empress’ eye,
And here’s the base fruit of her burning lust.
(To Aaron) Say, wall-eyed slave, whither wouldst thou
convey
This growing image of thy fiendlike face?
Why dost not speak? What, deaf? What, not a word?
A halter, soldiers! Hang him on this tree,
And by his side his fruit of bastardy.
