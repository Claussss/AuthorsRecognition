Here one man’s hand leaned on another’s head,
His nose being shadowed by his neighbour’s ear;
Here one being thronged bears back, all boll’n and red;
Another, smothered, seems to pelt and swear,
And in their rage such signs of rage they bear As but for loss of Nestor’s golden words
It seemed they would debate with angry swords.
