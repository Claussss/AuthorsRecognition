What hast thou done, unnatural and unkind? Killed her for whom my tears have made me blind.
I am as woeful as Virginius was,
And have a thousand times more cause than he
To do this outrage, and it now is done. What, was she ravished? Tell who did the deed. Will’t please you eat? Will’t please your highness feed?
