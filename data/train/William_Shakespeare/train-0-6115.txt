Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet
The noble Brutus, thrusting this report
Into his ears. I may say ‘thrusting’ it,
For piercing steel and darts envenomed
Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus
As tidings of this sight. TITINIUS Hie you, Messala, And I will seek for Pindarus the while. Exit Messala
