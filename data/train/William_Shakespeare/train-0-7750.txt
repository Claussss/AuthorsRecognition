O, but I fear some plot against your life. Why then, ‘tis thus: the King, of his high grace,
Seeing my faithful service to his state,
Intends to send me to the King of Heaven
For a rich present; where my soul shall prove
A true rememb’rer of his majesty.
Come, prithee mourn not. The worst chance is death,
And that brings endless joy for fickle breath.
