He gives Escalus papers There is our commission, From which we would not have you warp.
(To a lord) Call hither,
I say bid come before us, Angelo. Exit lord
(To Escalus) What figure of us think you he will
bear?â€”
For you must know we have with special soul
Elected him our absence to supply,
Lent him our terror, dressed him with our love,
And given his deputation all the organs
Of our own power. What think you of it?
