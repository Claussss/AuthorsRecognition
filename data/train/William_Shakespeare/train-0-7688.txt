But they that cast an eye still whence they came
Know how they rose, and how to use the same. My lord, you set a gloss on London’s fame,
And make it happy ever by your name.
Needs must we say when we remember More,
’Twas he that drove rebellion from our door
With grave discretions, mild and gentle breath,
Shielding a many subjects’ lives from death.
O, how our city is by you renowned,
And with your virtues our endeavours crowned.
