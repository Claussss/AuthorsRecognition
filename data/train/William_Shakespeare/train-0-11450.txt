dispersedly within) The watch-dogs bark. FSPIRITS] (within) Bow-wow! Hark, hark, I hear
 The strain of strutting Chanticleer
Cry ‘cock-a-diddle-dow’. Where should this music be? I’th’ air or th’earth?
It sounds no more; and sure it waits upon
Some god o‘th’ island. Sitting on a bank,
Weeping again the King my father’s wreck,
This music crept by me upon the waters,
Allaying both their fury and my passion
With its sweet air. Thence I have followed it—
Or it hath drawn me rather. But ’tis gone.
No, it begins again.
