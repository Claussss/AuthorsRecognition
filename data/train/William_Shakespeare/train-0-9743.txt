3.7
Enter Helen and the Widow If you misdoubt me that I am not she,
I know not how I shall assure you further
But I shall lose the grounds I work upon. Though my estate be fallâ€™n, I was well born,
Nothing acquainted with these businesses,
And would not put my reputation now
In any staining act. Nor would I wish you.
