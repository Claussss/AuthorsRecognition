Despair thy charm, And let the angel whom thou still hast served
Tell thee Macduff was from his mother’s womb 15
Untimely ripped. Accurs
For it hath cowed my better part of man;
And be these juggling fiends no more believed,
That palter with us in a double sense,
That keep the word of promise to our ear
And break it to our hope. I’ll not fight with thee.
