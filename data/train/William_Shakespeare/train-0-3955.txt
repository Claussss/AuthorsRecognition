DEMETRIUS shifting place ROBIN shifting place Follow my voice; weâ€™ll try no manhood here. Exeunt 3.3 Enter Lysander He goes before me, and still dares me on;
When I come where he calls, then he is gone.
The villain is much lighter heeled than I;
I followed fast, but faster he did fly,
That fallen am I in dark uneven way,
And here will rest me.
