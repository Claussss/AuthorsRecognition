And here in Troy, for trespass of thine eye,
The sire, the son, the dame and daughter die. ‘Why should the private pleasure of someone
Become the public plague of many moe?
Let sin alone committed light alone
Upon his head that hath transgressed so;
Let guiltless souls be freed from guilty woe. For one’s offence why should so many fall,
To plague a private sin in general?
