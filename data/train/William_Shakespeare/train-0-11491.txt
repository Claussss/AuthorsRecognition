She that is Queen of Tunis; she that dwells
Ten leagues beyond man’s life; she that from Naples
Can have no note—unless the sun were post—
The man i’th’ moon’s too slow—till new-born chins
Be rough and razorable; she that from whom
We all were sea-swallowed, though some cast again—
And by that destiny, to perform an act
Whereof what’s past is prologue, what to come
In yours and my discharge.
