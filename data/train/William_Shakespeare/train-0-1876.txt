I would I were, to be revenged on thee. RICHARD GLOUCESTER It is a quarrel most unnatural,
To be revenged on him that loveth you. It is a quarrel just and reasonable,
To be revenged on him that killed my husband. RICHARD GLOUCESTER He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,
Did it to help thee to a better husband.
