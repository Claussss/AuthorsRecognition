Sc. 12
Enter Edward Prince of Wales, Lord Audley and others 
PRINCE OF WALES Audley, the arms of death embrace us round
And comfort have we none, save that to die
We pay sour earnest for a sweeter life.
At Cr
Choked up those French mouths and dissevered them,
But now their multitudes of millions hide,
Masking, as â€™twere, the beauteous burning sun,
Leaving no hope to us but sullen dark
And eyeless terror of all-ending night.
