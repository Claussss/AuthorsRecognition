I humbly thank you. To sue to live, I find I seek to die,
And seeking death, find life. Let it come on. ISABELLA (within) What ho! Peace here, grace, and good company! Who’s there? Come in; the wish deserves a welcome. DUKE (to Claudio) Dear sir, ere long I’ll visit you again. CLAUDIO Most holy sir, I thank you.
