I pray you, stay not, but in haste to horse. I shall not break your bidding, good my lord.—
Where are my other men?—Monsieur, farewell. Exeunt Helen and attendants at one door Go thou toward home, where I will never come
Whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum.—
Away, and for our flight. Bravely. Coraggio!
