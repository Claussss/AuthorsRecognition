That bites the first-born infants of the spring. Well, say I am! Why should proud summer boast
Before the birds have any cause to sing?
Why should I joy in any abortive birth?
At Christmas I no more desire a rose
Than wish a snow in May’s new-fangled shows,
But like of each thing that in season grows.
So you to study, now it is too late,
Climb o’er the house to unlock the little gate.
