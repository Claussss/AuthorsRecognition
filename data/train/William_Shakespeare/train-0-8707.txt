[Exit with the body] The King is mad. How stiff is my vile sense,
That I stand up and have ingenious feeling
Of my huge sorrows! Better I were distraught;
So should my thoughts be fenced from my griefs,
And woes by wrong imaginations lose
The knowledge of themselves. A drum afar off. [Enter Edgar] EDGAR Give me your hand.
