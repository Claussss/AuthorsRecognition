What was th’impediment that broke this off? The French ambassador upon that instant
Craved audience—and the hour I think is come
To give him hearing. Is it four o’clock? ELY It is. 95 Then go we in, to know his embassy—
Which I could with a ready guess declare
Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.
