My voice is in my sword, thou bloodier villain
Than terms can give thee out.
They fight; alarum Thou losest labour. As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed.
Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
I bear a charmed life, which must not yield
To one of woman born.
