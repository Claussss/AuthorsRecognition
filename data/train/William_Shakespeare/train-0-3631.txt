Nurse calls within I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu.—
Anon, good Nurse!—Sweet Montague, be true.
Stay but a little; I will come again. Exit O blessed, bless
Being in night, all this is but a dream,
Too flattering-sweet to be substantial. Enter Juliet aloft Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
If that thy bent of love be honourable,
Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow,
By one that I’ll procure to come to thee,
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite,
And all my fortunes at thy foot I’ll lay,
And follow thee, my lord, throughout the world.
