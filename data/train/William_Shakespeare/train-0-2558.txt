Here, all enraged, such passion her assails
That patience is quite beaten from her breast.
She tears the senseless Sinon with her nails,
Comparing him to that unhappy guest
Whose deed hath made herself herself detest. At last she smilingly with this gives o‘er:
‘Fool, fool,’ quoth she, ‘his wounds will not be sore.’
