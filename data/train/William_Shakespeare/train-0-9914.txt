Good Helicane that stayed at home,
Not to eat honey like a drone
From others’ labours, for that he strive
To killen bad, keep good alive,
And to fulfil his prince’ desire
Sent word of all that haps in Tyre;
How Thaliart came full bent with sin
And hid intent to murdren him,
And that in Tarsus was not best
Longer for him to make his rest.
He deeming so put forth to seas,
Where when men been there’s seldom ease,
For now the wind begins to blow;
Thunder above and deeps below
Makes such unquiet that the ship
Should house him safe is wrecked and split,
And he, good prince, having all lost,
By waves from coast to coast is tossed.
All perishen of man, of pelf,
Ne aught escapend but himself,
Till fortune, tired with doing bad,
Threw him ashore to give him glad.
