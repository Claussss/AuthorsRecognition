Old Cassius still. OCTAVIUS Come, Antony, away. Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth.
If you dare fight today, come to the field.
If not, when you have stomachs. Exeunt Octavius, Antony, and their army Why, now blow wind, swell billow, and swim bark.
The storm is up, and all is on the hazard. Ho, Lucillius! Hark, a word with you.
