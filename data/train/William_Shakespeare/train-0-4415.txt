LORENZO Madam, with all my heart, I shall obey you in all fair commands. My people do already know my mind,
And will acknowledge you and Jessica
In place of Lord Bassanio and myself.
So fare you well till we shall meet again. Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you! I wish your ladyship all heartâ€™s content.
