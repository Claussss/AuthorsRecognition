Let th’event—That never-erring arbitrator—tell us
When we know all ourselves, and let us follow
The becking of our chance. 1.3
Enter Pirithous, Hippolyta, and Emilia No further. Sir, farewell. Repeat my wishes To our great lord, of whose success I dare not
Make any timorous question; yet I wish him
Excess and overflow of power, an’t might be,
To dure ill-dealing fortune. Speed to him;
Store never hurts good governors.
