Sweet rose, fair flower, untimely plucked, soon faded—
Plucked in the bud and faded in the spring;
Bright orient pearl, alack, too timely shaded;
Fair creature, killed too soon by death’s sharp sting,
Like a green plum that hangs upon a tree
And falls through wind before the fall should be.
I weep for thee, and yet no cause I have,
For why: thou left‘st me nothing in thy will,
And yet thou left’st me more than I did crave,
For why: I craved nothing of thee still.
O yes, dear friend, I pardon crave of thee:
Thy discontent thou didst bequeath to me.
