Know Banquo was your enemy. True, my lord. So is he mine, and in such bloody distance
That every minute of his being thrusts
Against my nearâ€™st of life; and though I could
With barefaced power sweep him from my sight
And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,
For certain friends that are both his and mine,
Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall
Who I myself struck down. And thence it is
That I to your assistance do make love,
Masking the business from the common eye
For sundry weighty reasons.
