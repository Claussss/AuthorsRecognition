Methinks I could Cry the amen, and yet my conscience says
She’s a good creature and, sweet lady, does
Deserve our better wishes. But sir, sir, Hear me, Sir Thomas. You’re a gentleman
Of mine own way. I know you wise, religious.
And let me tell you, it will ne’er be well—
’Twill not, Sir Thomas Lovell, take’t of me—
Till Cranmer, Cromwell—her two hands—and she,
Sleep in their graves.
