CLAUDIO O noble sir! Your overkindness doth wring tears from me.
I do embrace your offer; and dispose
For henceforth of poor Claudio. Tomorrow then I will expect your coming.
Tonight I take my leave. This naughty man
Shall face to face be brought to Margaret,
Who I believe was packed in all this wrong,
Hired to it by your brother.
