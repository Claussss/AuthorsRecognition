SECOND QUEEN Now you may take him, Drunk with his victory. THIRD QUEEN And his army full Of bread and sloth. Artesius, that best knowest How to draw out, fit to this enterprise
The primâ€™st for this proceeding and the number
To carry such a business: forth and levy
Our worthiest instruments, whilst we dispatch
This grand act of our life, this daring deed
Of fate in wedlock.
