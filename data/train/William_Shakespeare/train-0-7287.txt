ULYSSES I cannot conjure, Trojan. She was not, sure. ULYSSES Most sure, she was. Why, my negation hath no taste of madness. Nor mine, my lord. Cressid was here but now. Let it not be believed, for womanhood.

To stubborn critics, apt without a theme
For depravation to square the general sex
By Cressidâ€™s rule. Rather, think this not Cressid.
