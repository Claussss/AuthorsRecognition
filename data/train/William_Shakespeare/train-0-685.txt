Will she? I know now how to tame a shrew.
I dreamt upon it all this night till now,
And thou hast waked me out of the best dream
That ever I had in my life. But I’ll to my
Wife presently and tame her too,
An if she anger me. Nay, tarry, Sly, for I’ll go home with thee
And hear the rest that thou hast dreamt tonight.
