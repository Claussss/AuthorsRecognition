But there’s a saying very old and true: ‘If that you will France win, Then with Scotland first begin.’  For once the eagle England being in prey,
To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot
Comes sneaking, and so sucks her princely eggs,
Playing the mouse in absence of the cat,
To ’tame and havoc more than she can eat.
