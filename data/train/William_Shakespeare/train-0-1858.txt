RICHARD GLOUCESTER No doubt, no doubtâ€”and so shall Clarence too,
For they that were your enemies are his,
And have prevailed as much on him as you. LORD HASTINGS More pity that the eagles should be mewed
While kites and buzzards prey at liberty. RICHARD GLOUCESTER What news abroad? 135 LORD HASTINGS
