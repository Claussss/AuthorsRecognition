DUKE SENIOR What fool is this? 35 O worthy fool!—One that hath been a courtier,
And says ‘If ladies be but young and fair
They have the gift to know it.’ And in his brain,
Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
After a voyage, he hath strange places crammed
With observation, the which he vents
In mangled forms. O that I were a fool,
I am ambitious for a motley coat.
