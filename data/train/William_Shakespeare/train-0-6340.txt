So please you, for I never heard it yet,
Yet heard too much of Phoebe’s cruelty. She Phoebes me. Mark how the tyrant writes:
(reads) ‘Art thou god to shepherd turned,
That a maiden’s heart hath burned?’
Can a woman rail thus? SILVIUS Call you this railing? ROSALIND (reads) ‘Why, thy godhead laid apart,
Warr’st thou with a woman’s heart?’
