SECOND CLOWN Go to. FIRST CLOWN What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter? SECOND CLOWN The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand tenants. FIRST CLOWN I like thy wit well, in good faith. The gallows does well. But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the church, argal the gallows may do well to thee. Toâ€™t again, come.
