Is not that he that lies upon the ground? He lies not like the living.—O my heart! Is not that he? TITINlUS No, this was he, Messala; But Cassius is no more. O setting sun,
As in thy red rays thou dost sink tonight,
So in his red blood Cassius’ day is set.
The sun of Rome is set. Our day is gone.
Clouds, dews, and dangers come. Our deeds are done.
Mistrust of my success hath done this deed.
