CELIA So you may put a man in your belly. ROSALIND Is he of Godâ€™s making? What manner of man? Is his head worth a hat? Or his chin worth a beard? CELIA Nay, he hath but a little beard. ROSALIND Why, God will send more, if the man will be thankful. Let me stay the growth of his beard, if thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin.
