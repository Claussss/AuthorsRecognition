MOTE A woman, master. ARMADO Of what complexion ? MOTE Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the four. ARMADO Tell me precisely of what complexion? MOTE Of the sea-water green, sir. ARMADO Is that one of the four complexions? MOTE As I have read, sir; and the best of them, too. ARMADO Green indeed is the colour of lovers, but to have a love of that colour, methinks Samson had small reason for it. He surely affected her for her wit.
