RICHARD GLOUCESTER Commend me to Lord William. Tell him, Catesby,
His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries
Tomorrow are let blood at Pomfret Castle,
And bid my lord, for joy of this good news,
Give Mrs Shore one gentle kiss the more. Good Catesby, go effect this business soundly. My good lords both, with all the heed I can.
