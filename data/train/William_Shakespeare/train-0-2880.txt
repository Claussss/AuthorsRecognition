DROMIO OF SYRACUSE (aside) O, for my beads! I cross me for a sinner.
This is the fairy land. O spite of spites,
We talk with goblins, oafs, and sprites.
If we obey them not, this will ensue:
They’ll suck our breath or pinch us black and blue. Why prat‘st thou to thyself, and answer’st not?
Dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot.
