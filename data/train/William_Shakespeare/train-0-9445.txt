CLEOPATRA Good my lord— ANTONY You have been a boggler ever. But when we in our viciousness grow hard—
O misery on’t!—the wise gods seel our eyes,
In our own filth drop our clear judgements, make us
Adore our errors, laugh at’s while we strut
To our confusion. O, is’t come to this? I found you as a morsel cold upon
Dead Caesar’s trencher; nay, you were a fragment
Of Gnaeus Pompey’s, besides what hotter hours
Unregistered in vulgar fame you have
Luxuriously picked out. For I am sure,
Though you can guess what temperance should be,
You know not what it is.
