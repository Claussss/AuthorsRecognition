CAMILLO (to the Old Shepherd) Why, how now, father? Speak ere thou diest. OLD SHEPHERD I cannot speak, nor think, Nor dare to know that which I know.
(To Florizel) O sir, You have undone a man of fourscore-three,
That thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea,
To die upon the bed my father died,
To lie close by his honest bones. But now
Some hangman must put on my shroud, and lay me
Where no priest shovels in dust.
(To Perdita)
