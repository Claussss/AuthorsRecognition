Are you so formal, sir? Well, I must wait.
(Aside) And watch withal, for but I be deceived
Our fine musician groweth amorous. Madam, before you touch the instrument
To learn the order of my fingering,
I must begin with rudiments of art,
To teach you gamut in a briefer sort,
More pleasant, pithy, and effectual
Than hath been taught by any of my trade;
And there it is in writing, fairly drawn.
