I do beseech you, either not believe
The envious slanders of her false accusers
Or, if she be accused on true report,
Bear with her weakness, which I think proceeds
From wayward sickness, and no grounded malice. Saw you the King today, my lord of Derby? But now the Duke of Buckingham and I
Are come from visiting his majesty.
