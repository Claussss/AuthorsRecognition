DUKE FREDERICK Send to his brother; fetch that gallant hither.
If he be absent, bring his brother to me,
I’ll make him find him. Do this suddenly,
And let not search and inquisition quail
To bring again these foolish runaways. Exeunt severally 2.3
Enter Orlando and Adam, meeting 
ORLANDO Who’s there?
