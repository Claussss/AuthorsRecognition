PRIAM Come, Hector, come. Go back. Thy wife hath dreamt, thy mother hath had visions,
Cassandra doth foresee, and I myself
Am like a prophet suddenly enrapt
To tell thee that this day is ominous.
Therefore come back. HECTOR Aeneas is afield, And I do stand engaged to many Greeks,
Even in the faith of valour, to appear
This morning to them.
