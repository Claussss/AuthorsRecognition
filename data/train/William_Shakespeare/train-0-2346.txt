As falcons to the lure, away she flies.
The grass stoops not, she treads on it so light;
And in her haste unfortunately spies
The foul boarâ€™s conquest on her fair delight; Which seen, her eyes, as murdered with the view,
Like stars ashamed of day, themselves withdrew. Or as the snail, whose tender horns being hit
Shrinks backward in his shelly cave with pain,
And there, all smothered up, in shade doth sit,
Long after fearing to creep forth again;
