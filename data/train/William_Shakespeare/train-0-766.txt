CARDINAL BEAUFORT I am Plantagenet as well as thou,
And son to John of Gaunt. GLOUCESTER In bastardy. CARDINAL BEAUFORT I scorn thy words. Make up no factious numbers for the matter,
In thine own person answer thy abuse. CARDINAL BEAUFORT Ay, where thou dar‘st not peep; an if thou dar’st,
This evening on the east side of the grove.
