Thus ebbs and flows the current of her sorrow,
And time doth weary time with her complaining.
She looks for night, and then she longs for morrow,
And both she thinks too long with her remaining.
Short time seems long in sorrowâ€™s sharp sustaining. Though woe be heavy, yet it seldom sleeps,
And they that watch see time how slow it creeps.
