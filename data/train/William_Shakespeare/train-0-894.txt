O Thou eternal mover of the heavens,
Look with a gentle eye upon this wretch.
O, beat away the busy meddling fiend
That lays strong siege unto this wretch’s soul,
And from his bosom purge this black despair. See how the pangs of death do make him grin. Disturb him not; let him pass peaceably. Peace to his soul, if God’s good pleasure be.
Lord Card‘nal, if thou think’st on heaven’s bliss,
Hold up thy hand, make signal of thy hope.
