GRAZIANO (to Shylock) In christâ€™ning shalt thou have two godfathers.
Had I been judge thou shouldst have had ten more,
To bring thee to the gallows, not the font. Exit Shylock DUKE (to Portia) Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner. I humbly do desire your grace of pardon. I must away this night toward Padua,
And it is meet I presently set forth.
