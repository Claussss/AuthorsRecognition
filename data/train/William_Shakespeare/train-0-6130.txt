Free from the bondage you are in, Messala.
The conquerors can but make a fire of him,
For Brutus only overcame himself,
And no man else hath honour by his death. So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,
That thou hast proved Lucilliusâ€™ saying true. All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.
(To Strato)
Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?
