PROTEUS And what says she to my little jewel? LANCE Marry, she says your dog was a cur, and tells you currish thanks is good enough for such a present. PROTEUS But she received my dog? LANCE No indeed did she not. Here have I brought him back again. PROTEUS What, didst thou offer her this from me? LANCE Ay, sir. The other squirrel was stolen from me by the hangman boys in the market place, and then I offered her mine own, who is a dog as big as ten of yours, and therefore the gift the greater.
