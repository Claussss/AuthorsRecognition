and Shrewsbury My lords of Surrey and of Shrewsbury, give me your
hands yet before we part. Ye see, though it pleaseth the
King to raise me thus high, yet I am not proud; for the
higher I mount the better I can see my friends about me.
I am now on a far voyage, and this strange wooden
horse must bear me thither. Yet I perceive by your looks
you like my bargain so ill that there’s not one of ye all
dare venture with me. (Walking) Truly, here’s a most
sweet gallery. I like the air of it better than my garden at
Chelsea. By your patience, good people that have
pressed thus into my bedchamber, if you’ll not trouble
me I’ll take a sound sleep here.
