Yet I was mortally brought forth, and am
No other than I seem. PERICLES aside I am great with woe, and shall deliver weeping.
My dearest wife was like this maid, and such
My daughter might have been. My queen’s square
brows,
Her stature to an inch, as wand-like straight,
As silver-voiced, her eyes as jewel-like,
And cased as richly, in pace another Juno,
Who starves the ears she feeds, and makes them
hungry
The more she gives them speech.—Where do you live?
