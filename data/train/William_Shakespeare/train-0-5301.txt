He gives the King papers O Westmorland, thou art a summer bird
Which ever in the haunch of winter sings
The lifting up of day. Enter Harcourt Look, hereâ€™s more news. From enemies heaven keep your majesty;
And when they stand against you, may they fall
As those that I am come to tell you of!
The Earl Northumberland and the Lord Bardolph,
With a great power of English and of Scots,
Are by the sheriff of Yorkshire overthrown.
The manner and true order of the fight
This packet, please it you, contains at large.
