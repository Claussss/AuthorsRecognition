PLAYER KING Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too.
My operant powers their functions leave to do,
And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
Honoured, beloved; and haply one as kind
For husband shalt thouâ€” PLAYER QUEEN O, confound the rest! Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
In second husband let me be accurst;
None wed the second but who killed the first.
