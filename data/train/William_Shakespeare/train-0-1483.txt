Bedford dies, and is carried in by two in his chair 
3.6
An alarum. Enter Lord Talbot, the Duke of Burgundy, and the rest of the English soldiers Lost and recovered in a day again!
This is a double honour, Burgundy;
Yet heavens have glory for this victory! Warlike and martial Talbot, Burgundy
Enshrines thee in his heart, and there erects
Thy noble deeds as valourâ€™s monuments.
