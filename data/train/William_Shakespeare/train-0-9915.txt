[Enter Pericles wet and half-naked] And here he comes. What shall be next
Pardon old Gower; this ’longs the text. Exit [Thunder and lightning] Yet cease your ire, you angry stars of heaven!
Wind, rain, and thunder, remember earthly man
Is but a substance that must yield to you,
And I, as fits my nature, do obey you.
Alas, the seas hath cast me on the rocks,
Washed me from shore to shore, and left my breath
Nothing to think on but ensuing death.
Let it suffice the greatness of your powers
To have bereft a prince of all his fortunes,
And, having thrown him from your wat’ry grave,
Here to have death in peace is all he’ll crave.
