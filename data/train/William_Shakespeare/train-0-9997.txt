I have seen many, but such a night as this
Till now I ne’er endured. Your master will be dead ere you return.
There’s nothing can be ministered in nature
That can recover him. To poor man
pothecary
And tell me how it works. Exeunt poor man and servant Enter two Gentlemen FIRST GENTLEMAN Good morrow.
