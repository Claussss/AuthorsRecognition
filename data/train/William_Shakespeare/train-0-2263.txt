He sees his love, and nothing else he sees,
For nothing else with his proud sight agrees. Look when a painter would surpass the life
In limning out a well proportioned steed,
His art with natureâ€™s workmanship at strife,
As if the dead the living should exceed: So did this horse excel a common one
In shape, in courage, colour, pace, and bone.
