Stay, madam, here is more belongs to her.
First thresh the corn, then after burn the straw.
This minion stood upon her chastity,
Upon her nuptial vow, her loyalty,
And with that quaint hope braves your mightiness.
And shall she carry this unto her grave? An if she do I would I were an eunuch.
Drag hence her husband to some secret hole,
And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust.
