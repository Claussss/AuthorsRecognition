MENENIUS (to Coriolanus) Pray you be gone. I’ll try whether my old wit be in request
With those that have but little. This must be patched
With cloth of any colour. COMINIUS Nay, come away. Exeunt Coriolanus and Cominius A PATRICIAN This man has marred his fortune. His nature is too noble for the world.
He would not flatter Neptune for his trident
Or Jove for’s power to thunder. His heart’s his mouth.
What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent,
And, being angry, does forget that ever
He heard the name of death.
