Forbear, Seleucus. Exit Seleucus Be it known that we, the greatest, are misthought
For things that others do; and when we fall
We answer others’ merits in our name,
Are therefore to be pitied. Not what you have reserved nor what acknowledged
Put we i’th’ roll of conquest. Still be’t yours.
Bestow it at your pleasure, and believe
Caesar’s no merchant, to make prize with you
Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheered.
Make not your thoughts your prisons. No, dear
Queen;
For we intend so to dispose you as
Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed and sleep.
Our care and pity is so much upon you
That we remain your friend; and so adieu.
