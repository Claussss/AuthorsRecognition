PRINCE HARRY So please your majesty, I would I could
Quit all offences with as clear excuse
As well as I am doubtless I can purge
Myself of many I am charged withal;
Yet such extenuation let me beg
As, in reproof of many tales devised—
Which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear
By smiling pickthanks and base newsmongers—
I may, for some things true wherein my youth
Hath faulty wandered and irregular,
Find pardon on my true submission.
