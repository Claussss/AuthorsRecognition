SIR TOBY By this hand, they are scoundrels and substractors that say so of him. Who are they? MARIA They that add, moreover, he’s drunk nightly in your company. SIR TOBY With drinking healths to my niece. I’ll drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat and drink in Illyria. He’s a coward and a coistrel that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o’th’ toe, like a parish top. What wench, Castiliano, vulgo, for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface.
