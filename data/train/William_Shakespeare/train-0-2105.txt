Let me have open means to come to them,
And soon I’ll rid you from the fear of them. KING RICHARD Thou sing’st sweet music. Hark, come hither, Tyrrell.
Go, by this token. Rise, and lend thine ear. Richard whispers in his ear ‘Tis no more but so. Say it is done,
And I will love thee, and prefer thee for it.
