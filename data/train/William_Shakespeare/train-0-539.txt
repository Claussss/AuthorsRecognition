HORTENSIO Madam, my instrument’s in tune. BIANCA Let’s hear. (Hortensio plays) O fie, the treble jars. LUCENTIO Spit in the hole, man, and tune again. Hortensio tunes his lute again BIANCA Now let me see if I can construe it. ‘Hic ibat Simois’, I know you not—‘hic est Sigeia tellus’, I trust you not—‘hic steterat Priami’, take heed he hear us not—‘regia’, presume not—‘celsa senis’, despair not.
