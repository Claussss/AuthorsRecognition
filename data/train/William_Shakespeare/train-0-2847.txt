ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Thy mistress’ marks? What mistress, slave, hast thou? DROMIO OF EPHESUS Your worship’s wife, my mistress, at the Phoenix:
She that doth fast till you come home to dinner,
And prays that you will hie you home to dinner. ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,
Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave!
