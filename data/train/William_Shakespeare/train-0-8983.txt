FIRST SENATOR What we are sorry for, ourselves in thee.
The senators with one consent of love
Entreat thee back to Athens, who have thought
On special dignities which vacant lie
For thy best use and wearing. SECOND SENATOR They confess Toward thee forgetfulness too general-gross,
Which now the public body, which doth seldom
Play the recanter, feeling in itself
A lack of Timonâ€™s aid, hath sense withal
Of it own fail, restraining aid to Timon;
And send forth us to make their sorrowed render,
Together with a recompense more fruitful
Than their offence can weigh down by the dram;
Ay, even such heaps and sums of love and wealth
As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs,
And write in thee the figures of their love,
Ever to read them thine.
