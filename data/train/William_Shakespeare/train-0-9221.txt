Exit. Alarums 
5.9
Enter Malcolm and Siward This way, my lord. The castle’s gently rendered.
The tyrant’s people on both sides do fight.
The noble thanes do bravely in the war.
The day almost itself professes yours,
And little is to do. We have met with foes That strike beside us. Enter, sir, the castle.
