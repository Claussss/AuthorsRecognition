[Exit Governor] Come, Uncle Exeter,
Go you and enter Harfleur. There remain,
And fortify it strongly â€™gainst the French.
Use mercy to them all. For us, dear uncle,
The winter coming on, and sickness growing
Upon our soldiers, we will retire to Calais.
Tonight in Harfleur will we be your guest;
Tomorrow for the march are we addressed.
