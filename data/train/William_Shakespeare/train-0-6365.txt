It is to be all made of sighs and tears,
And so am I for Phoebe. PHOEBE And I for Ganymede. ORLANDO And I for Rosalind. ROSALIND And I for no woman. It is to be all made of faith and service,
And so am I for Phoebe. PHOEBE And I for Ganymede. ORLANDO And I for Rosalind. ROSALIND And I for no woman. It is to be all made of fantasy,
All made of passion, and all made of wishes,
All adoration, duty, and observance,
All humbleness, all patience and impatience,
All purity, all trial, all obedience,
And so am I for Phoebe.
