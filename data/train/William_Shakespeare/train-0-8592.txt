FIRST GENTLEMAN Give me your hand. Have you no more to say? KENT Few words, but to effect More than all yet: that when we have found the King—
In which endeavour I’ll this way, you that—
He that first lights on him holla the other. Exeunt severally Sc. 9
Storm. Enter King Lear and his Fool Blow, wind, and crack your cheeks! Rage, blow,
You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout
Till you have drenched the steeples, drowned the
cocks!
You sulphurous and thought-executing fires,
Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,
Singe my white head; and thou all-shaking thunder,
Smite flat the thick rotundity of the world,
Crack nature’s mould, all germens spill at once
That make ingrateful man.
