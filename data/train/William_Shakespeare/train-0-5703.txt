For me, the gold of France did not seduce,
Although I did admit it as a motive
The sooner to effect what I intended.
But God be thank
Which heartily in sufferance will rejoice,
Beseeching God and you to pardon me. Never did faithful subject more rejoice
At the discovery of most dangerous treason
Than I do at this hour joy oâ€™er myself,
Prevented from a damned enterprise.
My fault, but not my body, pardon, sovereign.
