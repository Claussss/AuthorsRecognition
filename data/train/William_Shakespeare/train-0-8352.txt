To whom, my lord? With whom? How am I false? OTHELLO (weeping) Ah, Desdemon, away, away, away! Alas, the heavy day! Why do you weep?
Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?
If haply you my father do suspect
An instrument of this your calling back,
Lay not your blame on me. If you have lost him,
I have lost him too.
