FIRST SENATOR These walls of ours Were not erected by their hands from whom
You have received your grief; nor are they such
That these great towâ€™rs, trophies, and schools should fall
For private faults in them. SECOND SENATOR Nor are they living Who were the motives that you first went out.
Shame that they wanted cunning, in excess,
Hath broke their hearts. March, noble lord,
Into our city with thy banners spread.
By decimation and a tithed death,
If thy revenges hunger for that food
Which nature loathes, take thou the destined tenth,
And by the hazard of the spotted die
Let die the spotted.
