CASSIUS (to the Poet) Away, away, be gone! Lucillius and Titinius, bid the commanders
Prepare to lodge their companies tonight. And come yourselves, and bring Messala with you
Immediately to us. Exeunt Lucillius and Titinius BRUTUS Lucius, a bowl of wine. Exit Lucius I did not think you could have been so angry.
