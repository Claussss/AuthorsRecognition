PORTER How got they in, and be hanged? Alas, I know not. How gets the tide in?
As much as one sound cudgel of four foot— He raises his cudgel You see the poor remainder—could distribute,
I made no spare, sir. You did nothing, sir. I am not Samson, nor Sir Guy, nor Colbrand,
To mow ‘em down before me; but if I spared any
That had a head to hit, either young or old,
He or she, cuckold or cuckold-maker,
Let me ne’er hope to see a chine again—
And that I would not for a cow, God save her!
