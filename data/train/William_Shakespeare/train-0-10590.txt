Go on, go on. Thou canst not speak too much. I have deserved
All tongues to talk their bitt’rest. A LORD (to Paulina) Say no more. Howe‘er the business goes, you have made fault
I’th’ boldness of your speech. I am sorry for’t. All faults I make, when I shall come to know them
I do repent. Alas, I have showed too much
The rashness of a woman. He is touched
To th’ noble heart. What’s gone and what’s past help
Should be past grief.
(To Leontes) Do not receive affliction
At my petition. I beseech you, rather
Let me be punished, that have minded you
Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege,
Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman.
The love I bore your queen—lo, fool again!
I’ll speak of her no more, nor of your children.
I’ll not remember you of my own lord,
Who is lost too. Take your patience to you,
And I’ll say nothing.
