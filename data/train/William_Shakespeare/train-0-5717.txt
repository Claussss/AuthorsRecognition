Ambassadors from Harry, King of England,
Do crave admittance to your majesty. KING CHARLES Weâ€™ll give them present audience. Go and bring them. Exit Messenger You see this chase is hotly followed, friends. Turn head and stop pursuit. For coward dogs
Most spend their mouths when what they seem to
threaten
Runs far before them. Good my sovereign,
Take up the English short, and let them know
Of what a monarchy you are the head.
Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sin
As self-neglecting.
