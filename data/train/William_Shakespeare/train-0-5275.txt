PRINCE JOHN You are too shallow, Hastings, much too shallow,
To sound the bottom of the after-times. WESTMORLAND Pleaseth your grace to answer them directly
How far forth you do like their articles? PRINCE JOHN I like them all, and do allow them well, 280
And swear here, by the honour of my blood,
My father’s purposes have been mistook,
And some about him have too lavishly
Wrested his meaning and authority.
(To the Archbishop)
My lord, these griefs shall be with speed redressed;
Upon my soul they shall. If this may please you,
Discharge your powers unto their several counties,
As we will ours; and here between the armies
Let’s drink together friendly and embrace,
That all their eyes may bear those tokens home
Of our restored love and amity.
