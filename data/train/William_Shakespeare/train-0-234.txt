I think your lordship is not ignorant
How his companion, youthful Valentine,
Attends the Emperor in his royal court. ANTONIO I know it well. â€˜Twere good, I think, your lordship sent him thither.
There shall he practise tilts and tournaments,
Hear sweet discourse, converse with noblemen,
And be in eye of every exercise
Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth.
