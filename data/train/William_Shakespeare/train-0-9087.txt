God’s benison go with you, and with those
That would make good of bad, and friends of foes.
Exeunt severally 3.1
Enter Banquo Thou hast it now: King, Cawdor, Glamis, all
As the weird women promised; and I fear
Thou played’st most foully for’t. Yet it was said
It should not stand in thy posterity,
But that myself should be the root and father
Of many kings. If there come truth from them—
As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine-
Why by the verities on thee made good
May they not be my oracles as well,
And set me up in hope? But hush, no more.
Sennet sounded. Enter Macbeth as King, Lady Macbeth
as Queen, Lennox, Ross, lords, and attendants
