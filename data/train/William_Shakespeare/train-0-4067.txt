Enter, marching,King John of England, the Bastard, Queen Eleanor, Lady Blanche, the Earl of Pembroke, and soldiers Peace be to France, if France in peace permit
Our just and lineal entrance to our own. 85
If not, bleed France, and peace ascend to heaven,
Whiles we, Godâ€™s wrathful agent, do correct
Their proud contempt that beats his peace to heaven.
