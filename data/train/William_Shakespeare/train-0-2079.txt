MAYOR (to Richard) Do, good my lord; your citizens entreat you. BUCKINGHAM (to Richard) Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffered love. CATFSBY (to Richard) O make them joyful: grant their lawful suit. RICHARD GLOUCESTER Alas, why would you heap this care on me?
I am unfit for state and majesty.
I do beseech you, take it not amiss.
I cannot, nor I will not, yield to you.
