CLEOPATRA Take thou no care; it shall be heeded. CLOWN Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is not worth the feeding. CLEOPATRA Will it eat me? CLOWN You must not think I am so simple but I know the devil himself will not eat a woman; I know that a woman is a dish for the gods, if the devil dress her not. But truly, these same whoreson devils do the gods great harm in their women; for in every ten that they make, the devils mar five.
