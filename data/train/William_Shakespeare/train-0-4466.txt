This ring, good sir? Alas, it is a trifle. I will not shame myself to give you this. I will have nothing else, but only this;
And now, methinks, I have a mind to it. Thereâ€™s more depends on this than on the value.
The dearest ring in Venice will I give you,
And find it out by proclamation.
Only for this, I pray you pardon me.
