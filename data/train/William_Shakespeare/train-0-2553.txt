The well skilled workman this mild image drew
For perjured Sinon, whose enchanting story
The credulous old Priam after slew;
Whose words like wildfire burnt the shining glory
Of rich-built Ilion, that the skies were sorry, And little stars shot from their fixed places
When their glass fell wherein they viewed their faces.
