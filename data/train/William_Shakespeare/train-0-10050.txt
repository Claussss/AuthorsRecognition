CLEON Heavens forgive it. DIONYZA And as for Pericles, What should he say? We wept after her hearse,
And yet we mourn. Her monument
Is almost finished, and her epitaphs
In glitt‘ring golden characters express
A gen’ral praise to her and care in us,
At whose expense ’tis done. CLEON Thou art like the harpy, Which, to betray, dost, with thine angel face, Seize in thine eagle talons.
