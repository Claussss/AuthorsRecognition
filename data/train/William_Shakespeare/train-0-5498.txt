Yet tell her of it, hear what she will say. No. Rather I will go to Benedick And counsel him to fight against his passion. And truly, Iâ€™ll devise some honest slanders To stain my cousin with. One doth not know How much an ill word may empoison liking. O, do not do your cousin such a wrong.
She cannot be so much without true judgement,
Having so swift and excellent a wit
As she is prized to have, as to refuse
So rare a gentleman as Signor Benedick.
