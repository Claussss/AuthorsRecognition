TROILUS (tearing the letter) Words, words, mere words, no matter from the heart.
Th’effect doth operate another way.
Go, wind, to wind: there turn and change together.
My love with words and errors still she feeds,
But edifies another with her deeds. PANDARUS Why, but hear you— Hence, broker-lackey! Ignomy and shame
Pursue thy life, and live aye with thy name.
