KING SIMONIDES O, that’s as much as you would be denied
Of your fair courtesy. Unclasp, unclasp. Thanks, gentlemen, to all. All have done well,
(To Pericles) But you the best.—Lights, pages, to
conduct
These knights unto their sev’ral lodgings.—Yours, sir,
We have giv’n order should be next our own.
