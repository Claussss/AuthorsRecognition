That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine. FRIAR LAURENCE God pardon sin!—Wast thou with Rosaline? With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No,
I have forgot that name and that name’s woe. FRIAR LAURENCE That’s my good son; but where hast thou been then? I’ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.
I have been feasting with mine enemy,
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me
That’s by me wounded. Both our remedies
Within thy help and holy physic lies.
I bear no hatred, blessed man, for lo,
My intercession likewise steads my foe.
