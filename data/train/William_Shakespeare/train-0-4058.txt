LADY FALCONBRIDGE Hast thou conspired with thy brother too,
That for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour?
What means this scorn, thou most untoward knave? Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like!
What! I am dubbed; I have it on my shoulder. 245
But, mother, I am not Sir Robertâ€™s son.
I have disclaimed Sir Robert; and my land,
Legitimation, name, and all is gone.
Then, good my mother, let me know my father;
Some proper man, I hope; who was it, mother? 250
LADY FALCONBRIDGE
Hast thou denied thyself a Falconbridge ?
