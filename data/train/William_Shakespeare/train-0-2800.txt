Sound trumpets. Enter Lord Audley  But say, what grim discouragement comes here?
Alas, what thousand arm
Have writ that note of death in Audley’s face?
(To Audley) Speak thou, that woo‘st death with thy
careless smile,
And look’st so merrily upon thy grave
As if thou wert enamoured on thine end.
What hungry sword hath so bereaved thy face
And lopped a true friend from my loving soul?
