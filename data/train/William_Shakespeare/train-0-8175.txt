2.1
Enter below Montano, Governor of Cyprus; two other gentlemen above What from the cape can you discern at sea? FIRST GENTLEMAN Nothing at all. It is a high-wrought flood.
I cannot ’twixt the heaven and the main
Descry a sail. Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land.
A fuller blast ne’er shook our battlements.
If it ha’ ruffianed so upon the sea,
What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,
Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?
