Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity,
Under th‘allowance of your great aspect,
Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire
On flick’ring Phoebus’ front— What mean’st by this? KENT To go out of my dialect, which you discommend so much. I know, sir, I am no flatterer. He that beguiled you in a plain accent was a plain knave, which for my part I will not be, though I should win your displeasure to entreat me to’t.
