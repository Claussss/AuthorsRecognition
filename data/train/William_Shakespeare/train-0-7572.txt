SURESBY (shrugging gladly) Ay, marry, Lifter, wherefore serve they? Only to feel Whether you go full under sail or no,
Or that your lading be aboard your barque. In plainer English, Lifter, if my purse
Be stored or no? Ye have it, sir. Excellent, excellent! Then, sir, you cannot but for mannersâ€™ sake
Walk on with him, for he will walk your way,
Alleging either you have much forgot him,
Or he mistakes you.
