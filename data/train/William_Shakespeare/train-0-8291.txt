Now, by yon marble heaven,
In the due reverence of a sacred vow
I here engage my words. IAGO Do not rise yet. Iago kneels Witness you ever-burning lights above,
You elements that clip us round about,
Witness that here Iago doth give up
The execution of his wit, hands, heart
To wronged Othelloâ€™s service. Let him command,
And to obey shall be in me remorse,
What bloody business ever.
