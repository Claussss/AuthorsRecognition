Affection faints not, like a pale-faced coward,
But then woos best when most his choice is froward. When he did frown, O, had she then gave over,
Such nectar from his lips she had not sucked.
Foul words and frowns must not repel a lover.
What though the rose have prickles, yet â€™tis plucked! Were beauty under twenty locks kept fast,
Yet love breaks through, and picks them all at last.
