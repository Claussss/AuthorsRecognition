The deep vexation of his inward soul
Hath served a dumb arrest upon his tongue,
Who, mad that sorrow should his use control,
Or keep him from heart-easing words so long,
Begins to talk; but through his lips do throng Weak words, so thick come in his poor heartâ€™s aid
That no man could distinguish what he said.
