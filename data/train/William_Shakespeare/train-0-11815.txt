CARDINAL WOLSEY God bless him. The next is that Sir Thomas More is chosen
Lord Chancellor in your place. CARDINAL WOLSEY That’s somewhat sudden. But he
Long in his highness’ favour, and do justice
For truth’s sake and his conscience, that his bones,
When he has run his course and sleeps in blessings,
May have a tomb of orphans’ tears wept on him.
What more?
