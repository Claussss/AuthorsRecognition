Win her with gifts if she respect not words.
Dumb jewels often in their silent kind
More than quick words do move a woman’s mind. But she did scorn a present that I sent her. A woman sometime scorns what best contents her.
Send her another. Never give her o’er,
For scorn at first makes after-love the more.
If she do frown, ‘tis not in hate of you,
But rather to beget more love in you.
If she do chide, ‘tis not to have you gone,
Forwhy the fools are mad if left alone.
Take no repulse, whatever she doth say:
For ‘Get you gone’ she doth not mean ‘Away’.
Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;
Though ne’er so black, say they have angels’ faces.
That man that hath a tongue I say is no man
If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.
