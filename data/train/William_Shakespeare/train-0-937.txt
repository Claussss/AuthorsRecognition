How now, madam? Still lamenting and mourning
Suffolk’s death?
I fear me, love, if that I had been dead,
Thou wouldest not have mourned so much for me. QUEEN MARGARET No, my love, I should not mourn, but die for thee. Enter a Messenger, Fin haste How now? What news? Why com’st thou in such haste? The rebels are in Southwark—fly, my lord!
Jack Cade proclaims himself Lord Mortimer,
Descended from the Duke of Clarence’ house,
And calls your grace usurper, openly,
And vows to crown himself in Westminster.
His army is a ragged multitude
Of hinds and peasants, rude and merciless.
Sir Humphrey Stafford and his brother’s death
Hath given them heart and courage to proceed.
All scholars, lawyers, courtiers, gentlemen,
They call false caterpillars and intend their death.
