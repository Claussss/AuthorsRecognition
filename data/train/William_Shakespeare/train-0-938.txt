O, graceless men; they know not what they do. My gracious lord, retire to Kenilworth
Until a power be raised to put them down. QUEEN MARGARET Ah, were the Duke of Suffolk now alive
These Kentish rebels would be soon appeased! Lord Saye, the trait’rous rabble hateth thee—
Therefore away with us to Kenilworth.
