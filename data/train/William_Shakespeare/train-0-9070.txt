LENNOX (to Macbeth) Good morrow, noble sir. Good morrow, both. Is the King stirring, worthy thane? He did command me to call timely on him.
I have almost slipped the hour. I’ll bring you to him. I know this is a joyful trouble to you,
But yet ’tis one. The labour we delight in physics pain.
This is the door.
