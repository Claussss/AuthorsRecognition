Pray heaven he prove so when you come to him. Now, as thou lovâ€™st me, do him not that wrong
To bear a hard opinion of his truth.
Only deserve my love by loving him,
And presently go with me to my chamber
To take a note of what I stand in need of
To furnish me upon my longing journey.
All that is mine I leave at thy dispose,
My goods, my lands, my reputation;
Only in lieu thereof dispatch me hence.
Come, answer not, but to it presently.
I am impatient of my tarriance.
