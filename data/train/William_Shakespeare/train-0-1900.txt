RICHARD GLOUCESTER You may deny that you were not the mean
Of my Lord Hastings’ late imprisonment. RIVERS She may, my lord, for— RICHARD GLOUCESTER She may, Lord Rivers; why, who knows not so?
She may do more, sir, than denying that.
She may help you to many fair preferments,
And then deny her aiding hand therein,
And lay those honours on your high desert.
What may she not? She may—ay, marry, may she.
