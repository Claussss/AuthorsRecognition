CORNWALL Why art thou angry? That such a slave as this should wear a sword,
Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,
Like rats, oft bite the holy cords a-twain
Which are too intrince t’unloose, smooth every
passion
That in the natures of their lords rebel;
Being oil to fire, snow to the colder moods,
Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks
With every gall and vary of their masters,
Knowing naught, like dogs, but following.
To Oswald
Smile you my speeches as I were a fool?
Goose, an I had you upon Sarum Plain
I’d drive ye cackling home to Camelot.
