BENVOLIO Soft, I will go along; An if you leave me’so, you do me wrong. Tut, I have lost myself. I am not here.
This is not Romeo; he’s some other where. Tell me in sadness, who is that you love? ROMEO What, shall I groan and tell thee? Groan? Why no; but sadly tell me who. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will,
A word ill urged to one that is so ill.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
