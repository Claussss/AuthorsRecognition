Enter Luciana  Go, Dromio, there’s the money. Bear it straight,
And bring thy master home immediately. Come, sister, I am pressed down with conceit:
Conceit, my comfort and my injury. 4.3
Enter Antipholus of Syracuse, wearing the chain 
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE There’s not a man I meet but doth salute me
As if I were their well-acquainted friend,
And everyone doth call me by my name.
Some tender money to me, some invite me,
Some other give me thanks for kindnesses.
Some offer me commodities to buy.
Even now a tailor called me in his shop,
And showed me silks that he had bought for me,
And therewithal took measure of my body.
Sure, these are but imaginary wiles,
And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here.
