KING OF FRANCE (giving money) There’s for thy news. Return unto thy barque,
And if thou scape the bloody stroke of war
And do survive the conflict, come again,
And let us hear the manner of the fight. Exit Mariner
Mean space, my lords, ’tis best we be dispersed
To several places, lest they chance to land.
(To the King of Bohemia) First you, my lord, with your Bohemian troops,
Shall pitch your battles on the lower hand.
(To the Dauphin 
My eldest son, the Duke of Normandy,
Together with this aid of Muscovites,
Shall climb the higher ground another way.
Here in the middle coast, betwixt you both,
Philippe, my youngest boy, and I will lodge.
So, lords, be gone, and look unto your charge,
You stand for France, an empire fair and large.
