Alarum. Enter Richard Duke of York YORK The army of the Queen hath got the field;
My uncles both are slain in rescuing me;
And all my followers to the eager foe
Turn back, and fly like ships before the wind,
Or lambs pursued by hunger-starved wolves.
My sons
But this I know—they have demeaned themselves
Like men born to renown by life or death.
Three times did Richard make a lane to me,
And thrice cried, ‘Courage, father, fight it out!’
And full as oft came Edward to my side,
With purple falchion painted to the hilt
In blood of those that had encountered him.
And when the hardiest warriors did retire,
Richard cried, ‘Charge and give no foot of ground!’
And cried ‘A crown or else a glorious tomb!
A sceptre or an earthly sepulchre!’
With this, we charged again—but out, alas—
We bodged again, as I have seen a swan
With bootless labour swim against the tide
And spend her strength with over-matching waves.
A short alarum within
