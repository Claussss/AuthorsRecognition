O infinite virtue, com’st thou smiling from
The world’s great snare uncaught? My nightingale, We have beat them to their beds. What, girl, though
grey
Do something mingle with our younger brown, yet
ha’ we
A brain that nourishes our nerves, and can
Get goal for goal of youth. Behold this man.
Commend unto his lips thy favouring hand;
Kiss it, my warrior.
