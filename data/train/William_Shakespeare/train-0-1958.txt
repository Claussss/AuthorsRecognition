So do not I. Go, coward as thou art.—
Well, I’ll go hide the body in some hole
Till that the Duke give order for his burial.
And, when I have my meed, I will away,
For this will out, and then I must not stay. Exit 2.1
Flourish. Enter King Edward, sick, Queen Elizabeth, Lord Marquis Dorset, Lord Rivers, Lord Hastings, Sir William Catesby, the Duke of Buckingham and Lord Gray
