Of all thy suitors here I charge thee tell
Whom thou lov’st best. See thou dissemble not. Believe me, sister, of all the men alive
I never yet beheld that special face
Which I could fancy more than any other. Minion, thou liest. Is’t not Hortensio? If you affect him, sister, here I swear
I’ll plead for you myself but you shall have him.
