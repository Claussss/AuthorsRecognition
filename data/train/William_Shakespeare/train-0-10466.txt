THIRD CONSPIRATOR Therefore, at your vantage, Ere he express himself or move the people
With what he would say, let him feel your sword,
Which we will second. When he lies along,
After your way his tale pronounced shall bury
His reasons with his body. Enter the Lords of the city Say no more. Here come the lords.
