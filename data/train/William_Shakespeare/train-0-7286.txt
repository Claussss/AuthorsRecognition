THERSITES (aside) A proof of strength she could not publish more
Unless she said, ‘My mind is now turned whore’. All’s done, my lord. TROILUS It is. ULYSSES Why stay we then? To make a recordation to my soul
Of every syllable that here was spoke.
But if I tell how these two did co-act,
Shall I not lie in publishing a truth?
Sith yet there is a credence in my heart,
An esperance so obstinately strong,
That doth invert th’attest of eyes and ears,
As if those organs had deceptious functions
Created only to calumniate.
Was Cressid here?
