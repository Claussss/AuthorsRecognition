I’ll go, my lord, and tell him what you say. Exit Enter Catesby Many good morrows to my noble lord. LORD HASTINGS Good morrow, Catesby. You are early stirring.
What news, what news, in this our tott’ring state? It is a reeling world indeed, my lord,
And I believe will never stand upright
Till Richard wear the garland of the realm.
