CHARMIAN I warrant you, madam.

Enter Antony and Octavia Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that,
That were excusable, that and thousands more
Of semblable import; but he hath waged
New wars ‘gainst Pompey, made his will and read it
To public ear, spoke scantly of me;
When perforce he could not
But pay me terms of honour, cold and sickly
He vented them, most narrow measure lent me.
When the best hint was given him, he not took’t,
Or did it from his teeth.
