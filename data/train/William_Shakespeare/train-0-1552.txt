Ay, marry, uncle; for I always thought
It was both impious and unnatural
That such immanity and bloody strife
Should reign among professors of one faith. Beside, my lord, the sooner to effect
And surer bind this knot of amity,
The Earl of Armagnac, near knit to Charles—
A man of great authority in France—
Proffers his only daughter to your grace
In marriage, with a large and sumptuous dowry.
