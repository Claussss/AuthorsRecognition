ANNE My honoured lord. Exit the Lord Chamberlain OLD LADY Why, this it is—see, see! I have been begging sixteen years in court,
Am yet a courtier beggarly, nor could
Come pat betwixt too early and too late
For any suit of pounds; and you—O, fate!—
A very fresh fish here—fie, fie upon
This compelled fortune!—have your mouth filled up
Before you open it.
