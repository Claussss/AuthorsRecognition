O Lord have mercy on me, woeful man! What chance is this that suddenly hath crossed us?
Speak, Salisbury—at least, if thou canst, speak.
How far‘st thou, mirror of all martial men?
One of thy eyes and thy cheek’s side struck off?
Accursed tower! Accursed fatal hand
That hath contrived this woeful tragedy!
In thirteen battles Salisbury o’ercame;
Henry the Fifth he first trained to the wars;
Whilst any trump did sound or drum struck up
His sword did ne‘er leave striking in the field.
Yet liv’st thou, Salisbury? Though thy speech doth
fail,
One eye thou hast to look to heaven for grace.
The sun with one eye vieweth all the world.
Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive
If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands.—
Sir Thomas Gargrave, hast thou any life?
Speak unto Talbot. Nay, look up to him.—
Bear hence his body; I will help to bury it.
