A pretty while these pretty creatures stand,
Like ivory conduits coral cisterns filling.
One justly weeps, the other takes in hand
No cause but company of her drops’ spilling.
Their gentle sex to weep are often willing, Grieving themselves to guess at others’ smarts,
And then they drown their eyes or break their hearts.
