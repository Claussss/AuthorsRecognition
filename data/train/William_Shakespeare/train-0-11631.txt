I mean, who set the body and the limbs
Of this great sport together, as you guess? One, certes, that promises no element
In such a business. I pray you who, my lord? All this was ordered by the good discretion
Of the right reverend Cardinal of York. The devil speed him! No man’s pie is freed
From his ambitious finger. What had he
To do in these fierce vanities? I wonder
That such a keech can, with his very bulk,
Take up the rays o’th’ beneficial sun,
And keep it from the earth.
