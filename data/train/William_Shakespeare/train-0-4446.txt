Here ’tis, most reverend doctor, here it is. Shylock, there’s thrice thy money offered thee. An oath, an oath! I have an oath in heaven. Shall I lay perjury upon my soul? No, not for Venice. PORTIA Why, this bond is forfeit, And lawfully by this the Jew may claim
A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off
Nearest the merchant’s heart. (To Shylock) Be merciful.
Take thrice thy money. Bid me tear the bond.
