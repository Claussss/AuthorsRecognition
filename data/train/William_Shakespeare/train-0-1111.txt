My royal father, cheer these noble lords
And hearten those that fight in your defence.
Unsheathe your sword, good father; cry ‘Saint George!’ March. Enter Edward Duke of York, the Earl of
Warwick, Richard, George, the Duke of Norfolk, the
Marquis of Montague, and soldiers Now, perjured Henry, wilt thou kneel for grace,
And set thy diadem upon my head—
Or bide the mortal fortune of the field?
