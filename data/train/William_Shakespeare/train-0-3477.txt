BOLINGBROKE Name it, fair cousin. Fair cousin? I am greater than a king;
For when I was a king my flatterers
Were then but subjects; being now a subject,
I have a king here to my flatterer.
Being so great, I have no need to beg. BOLINGBROKE Yet ask. RICHARD And shall I have? BOLINGBROKE You shall. RICHARD Then give me leave to go.
