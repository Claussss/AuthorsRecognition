Content, in faith. I’ll seal to such a bond,
And say there is much kindness in the Jew. You shall not seal to such a bond for me.
I’ll rather dwell in my necessity. Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it.
Within these two months—that’s a month before
This bond expires—I do expect return
Of thrice three times the value of this bond.
