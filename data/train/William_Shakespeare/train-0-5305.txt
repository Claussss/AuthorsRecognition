Speak lower, princes, for the King recovers. This apoplexy will certain be his end. I pray you take me up and bear me hence
Into some other chamber; softly, pray. The King is carried over the stage in his bed Let there be no noise made, my gentle friends,
Unless some dull and favourable hand
Will whisper music to my weary spirit.
