Sir, this should be answered. â€™Tis done already, and the messenger gone.
I have told him Lepidus was grown too cruel,
That he his high authority abused
And did deserve his change. For what I have
conquered,
I grant him part; but then in his Armenia,
And other of his conquered kingdoms,
I demand the like.
