CARDINAL WOLSEY You have here, lady, And of your choice, these reverend fathers, men
Of singular integrity and learning,
Yea, the elect o’th’ land, who are assembled
To plead your cause. It shall be therefore bootless
That longer you desire the court, as well
For your own quiet, as to rectify
What is unsettled in the King.
