Madam, I pity much your grievances,
Which, since I know they virtuously are placed,
I give consent to go along with you,
Recking as little what betideth me
As much I wish all good befortune you.
When will you go? This evening coming. Where shall I meet you? At Friar Patrickâ€™s cell, Where I intend holy confession.
