FIRST LORD One of your lordship’s pages. CLOTEN Is it fit I went to look upon him? Is there no derogation in’t? SECOND LORD You cannot derogate, my lord. CLOTEN Not easily, I think. SECOND LORD (aside) You are a fool granted, therefore your issues, being foolish, do not derogate. CLOTEN Come, I’ll go see this Italian. What I have lost today at bowls I’ll win tonight of him. Come, go.
