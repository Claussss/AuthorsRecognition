‘So shall these slaves be king, and thou their slave;
Thou nobly base, they basely dignified;
Thou their fair life, and they thy fouler grave;
Thou loathed in their shame, they in thy pride.
The lesser thing should not the greater hide. The cedar stoops not to the base shrub’s foot,
But low shrubs wither at the cedar’s root.
