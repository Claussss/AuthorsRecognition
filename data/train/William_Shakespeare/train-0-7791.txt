An so it might have liked my sovereign lord,
I would to God you might have walked there still.
He weeps Sir, we are walking to a better place.
O sir, your kind and loving tears
Are like sweet odours to embalm your friend.
Thank your good lady; since I was your guest
She has made me a very wanton, in good sooth.
