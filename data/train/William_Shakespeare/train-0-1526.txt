RICHARD DUKE OF YORK He dies, we lose; I break my warlike word;
We mourn, France smiles; we lose, they daily get,
All ‘long of this vile traitor Somerset. Then God take mercy on brave Talbot’s soul,
And on his son young John, who two hours since
I met in travel toward his warlike father.
This seven years did not Talbot see his son,
And now they meet where both their lives are done.
