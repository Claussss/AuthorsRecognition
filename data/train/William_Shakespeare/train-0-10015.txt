Sc. 14
Enter Cerimon and Thaisa Madam, this letter and some certain jewels
Lay with you in your coffer, which are all
At your command. Know you the character? It is my lord’s. That I was shipped at sea
I well remember, ev’n on my eaning time,
But whether there delivered, by th’ holy gods
I cannot rightly say. But since King Pericles,
My wedded lord, I ne‘er shall see again,
A vestal liv’ry will I take me to,
And never more have joy.
