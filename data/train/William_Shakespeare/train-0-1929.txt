RICHARD GLOUCESTER Your eyes drop millstones when fools’ eyes fall tears.
I like you, lads. About your business straight.
Go, go, dispatch. Exeunt Richard at one door, the Murderers at another 1.4
Enter George Duke of Clarence and Sir Robert Brackenbury 
Why looks your grace so heavily today? O I have passed a miserable night,
So full of fearful dreams, of ugly sights,
That as I am a Christian faithful man,
I would not spend another such a night
Though ‘twere to buy a world of happy days,
So full of dismal terror was the time.
