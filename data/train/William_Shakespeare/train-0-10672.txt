How, Camillo, May this, almost a miracle, be done?—
That I may call thee something more than man,
And after that trust to thee. Have you thought on A place whereto you’ll go? Not any yet. But as th’unthought-on accident is guilty
To what we wildly do, so we profess
Ourselves to be the slaves of chance, and flies
Of every wind that blows.
