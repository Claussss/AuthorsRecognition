He plucks a white rose Let him that is no coward nor no flatterer,
But dare maintain the party of the truth,
Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me. He plucks a red rose I love no colours, and without all colour
Of base insinuating flattery
I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet. I pluck this red rose with young Somerset,
And say withal I think he held the right.
