 3.3
Enter King Claudius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern 
KING CLAUDIUS I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you.
I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
And he to England shall along with you.
The terms of our estate may not endure
Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow
Out of his lunacies.
