If you shall prove This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy
Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence,
Where yet she never was. Exit guarded Enter the Gentleman Austringer with a paper KING I am wrapped in dismal thinkings. GENTLEMAN Gracious sovereign, Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not.
Hereâ€™s a petition from a Florentine
Who hath for four or five removes come short
To tender it herself. I undertook it,
Vanquished thereto by the fair grace and speech
Of the poor suppliant, who by this I know
Is here attending. Her business looks in her
With an importing visage, and she told me
In a sweet verbal brief it did concern
Your highness with herself.
