My lord your son drew on my master. No harm, I trust, is done? There might have been, But that my master rather played than fought,
And had no help of anger. They were parted
By gentlemen at hand. I am very glad on’t. Your son’s my father’s friend; he takes his part
To draw upon an exile—O brave sir!
I would they were in Afric both together,
Myself by with a needle, that I might prick
The goer-back. (To Pisanio) Why came you from your
master?
