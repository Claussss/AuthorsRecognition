OCTAVIA (weeping) My noble brother! The April’s in her eyes; it is love’s spring,
And these the showers to bring it on. Be cheerful. Sir, look well to my husband’s house, and— What, Octavia? I’ll tell you in your ear. She whispers to Caesar Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can
Her heart inform her tongue—the swan’-down
feather,
That stands upon the swell at full of tide,
And neither way inclines.
