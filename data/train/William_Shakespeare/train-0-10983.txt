Madam, I had rather— I know your lady does not love her husband.
I am sure of that, and at her late being here
She gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks
To noble Edmond. I know you are of her bosom. OSWALD I, madam? I speak in understanding. Y’are, I know’t.
Therefore I do advise you take this note.
My lord is dead. Edmond and I have talked,
And more convenient is he for my hand
Than for your lady’s. You may gather more.
If you do find him, pray you give him this,
And when your mistress hears thus much from you,
I pray desire her call her wisdom to her.
So, fare you well.
If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,
Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.
