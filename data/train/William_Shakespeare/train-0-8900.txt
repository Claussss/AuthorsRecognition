3.7
Enter divers of Timonâ€™s friends, amongstthem Lucullus, Lucius, Sempronius, and other Lords and Senators, 
FIRST LORD The good time of day to you, sir. SECOND LORD I also wish it to you. I think this honourable lord did but try us this other day. FIRST LORD Upon that were my thoughts tiring when we encountered. I hope it is not so low with him as he made it seem in the trial of his several friends.
