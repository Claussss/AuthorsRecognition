Say, Somerville-what says my loving son?
And, by thy guess, how nigh is Clarence now? At Southam I did leave him with his forces,
And do expect him here some two hours hence. A march afar off Then Clarence is at hand-I hear his drum. It is not his, my lord. Here Southam lies.
The drum your honour hears marcheth from Warwick.
