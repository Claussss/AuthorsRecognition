Let me end the story. I slew him there. Marry, the gods forfend! I would not thy good deeds should from my lips
Pluck a hard sentence. Prithee, valiant youth,
Deny’t again. GUIDERIUS I have spoke it, and I did it. CYMBELINE He was a prince. A most incivil one. The wrongs he did me
Were nothing prince-like, for he did provoke me
With language that would make me spurn the sea
If it could so roar to me. I cut off ’s head,
And am right glad he is not standing here
To tell this tale of mine.
