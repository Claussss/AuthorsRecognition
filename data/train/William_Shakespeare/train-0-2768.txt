PRINCE OF WALES Death’s name is much more mighty than his deeds.
Thy parcelling this power hath made it more
Than all the world! Call it but a power.
As many sands as these, my hands, can hold
Are but my handful of so many sands,
Eas‘ly ta’en up and quickly thrown away.
But if I stand to count them, sand by sand,
The number would confound my memory,
And make a thousand millions of a task
Which, briefly, is no more in deed than one.
These quarters, squadrons and these regiments
Before, behind us, and on either hand,
Are but a power. When we name a man,
His hand, his foot, his head hath several strengths,
And, being all but one self-instanced strength,
Why, all this many, Audley, is but one,
And we can call it all but one man’s strength.
He that hath far to go tells it by miles;
If he should tell the steps it kills his heart.
The drops are infinite that make a flood,
And yet, thou know’st, we call it but a rain.
There is but one France, and one king of France:
That France hath no more kings, and that same king
Hath but the puissant legion of one king.
And we have one. Then apprehend no odds,
For one to one is fair equality.
