Look to the lady. O, she’s but o’erjoyed.
Early one blustering morn this lady
Was thrown upon this shore. I oped the coffin,
Found there rich jewels, recovered her, and placed her
Here in Diana’s temple. PERICLES May we see them? Great sir, they shall be brought you to my house,
Whither I invite you. Look, Thaisa is
Recovered.
