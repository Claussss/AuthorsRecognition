CLOTEN Why, so I say. FIRST LORD Did you hear of a stranger that’s come to court tonight? CLOTEN A stranger, and I not know on’t? SECOND LORD (aside) He’s a strange fellow himself and knows it not. FIRST LORD There’s an Italian come, and, ’tis thought, one of Leonatus’ friends. CLOTEN Leonatus? A banished rascal; and he’s another, whatsoever he be. Who told you of this stranger?
