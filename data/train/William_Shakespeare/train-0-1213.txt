KING EDWARD Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice,
That you stand pensive, as half-malcontent? GEORGE OF CLARENCE As well as Louis of France, or the Earl of Warwick,
Which are so weak of courage and in judgement
That they’ll take no offence at our abuse. KING EDWARD Suppose they take offence without a cause—
They are but Louis and Warwick; I am Edward,
Your king and Warwick’s, and must have my will.
