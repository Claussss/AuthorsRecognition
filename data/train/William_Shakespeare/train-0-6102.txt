Even by the rule of that philosophy
By which I did blame Cato for the death
Which he did give himself—I know not how,
But I do find it cowardly and vile
For fear of what might fall so to prevent
The time of life—arming myself with patience
To stay the providence of some high powers
That govern us below.
