Sc. 2
An arras is drawn, and behind it, as in sessions, sit the Lord Mayor, Justice Suresby, and other Justices, and the Recorder, Sheriff More and the other Sheriff sitting by. Smart is the plaintiff, Lifter the prisoner at the bar 
LORD MAYOR Having dispatched our weightier businesses,
We may give ear to petty felonies.
Master Sheriff More, what is this fellow?
