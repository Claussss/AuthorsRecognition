See where his grace stands ’tween two clergymen. Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,
To stay him from the fall of vanity;
And see, a book of prayer in his hand—
True ornaments to know a holy man.—
Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,
Lend favourable ear to our request,
And pardon us the interruption
Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.
