PHRYNIA and TIMANDRA More counsel with more money, bounteous Timon. More whore, more mischief first; I have given you earnest. Strike up the drum towards Athens. Farewell, Timon.
If I thrive well, I’ll visit thee again. If I hope well, I’ll never see thee more. ALCIBIADES I never did thee harm. TIMON Yes, thou spok’st well of me.
