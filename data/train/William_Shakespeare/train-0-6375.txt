I have promised to make all this matter even.
Keep you your word, O Duke, to give your daughter.
You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter.
Keep your word, Phoebe, that you’ll marry me,
Or else refusing me to wed this shepherd.
Keep your word, Silvius, that you’ll marry her
If she refuse me; and from hence I go
To make these doubts all even.
