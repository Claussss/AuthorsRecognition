A ROMAN LORD Let Rome herself be bane unto herself,
And she whom mighty kingdoms curtsy to,
Like a forlorn and desperate castaway,
Do shameful execution on herself
But if my frosty signs and chaps of age,
Grave witnesses of true experience,
Cannot induce you to attend my words.
(To Lucius) Speak, Rome’s dear friend, as erst our
ancestor
When with his solemn tongue he did discourse
To lovesick Dido’s sad-attending ear
The story of that baleful-burning night
When subtle Greeks surprised King Priam’s Troy.
Tell us what Sinon hath bewitched our ears,
Or who hath brought the fatal engine in
That gives our Troy, our Rome, the civil wound.
My heart is not compact of flint nor steel,
Nor can I utter all our bitter grief,
But floods of tears will drown my oratory
And break my utt’rance even in the time
When it should move ye to attend me most,
And force you to commiseration.
Here’s Rome’s young captain. Let him tell the tale,
While I stand by and weep to hear him speak.
