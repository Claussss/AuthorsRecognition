Flourish. Exeunt all but Troilus and Ulysses My Lord Ulysses, tell me, I beseech you,
In what place of the field doth Calchas keep? At Menelaus’ tent, most princely Troilus.
There Diomed doth feast with him tonight—
Who neither looks on heaven nor on earth,
But gives all gaze and bent of amorous view
On the fair Cressid.
