Enter Sir Eglamour The sun begins to gild the western sky,
And now it is about the very hour
That Silvia at Friar Patrickâ€™s cell should meet me.
She will not fail; for lovers break not hours,
Unless it be to come before their time,
So much they spur their expedition. Enter Silvia See where she comes. Lady, a happy evening!
