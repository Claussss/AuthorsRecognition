BURGUNDY I know no answer. Sir, will you with those infirmities she owes,
Unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,
Covered with our curse and strangered with our oath,
Take her or leave her? BURGUNDY Pardon me, royal sir. Election makes not up on such conditions. Then leave her, sir; for by the power that made me,
I tell you all her wealth. (To France) For you, great
King,
I would not from your love make such a stray
To match you where I hate, therefore beseech you
To avert your liking a more worthier way
Than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed
Almost to acknowledge hers.
