ANTONY (to First Soldier) This is not Brutus, friend, but, I assure you,
A prize no less in worth. Keep this man safe.
Give him all kindness. I had rather have
Such men my friends than enemies.
To another Soldier
And see whe’er Brutus be alive or dead,
And bring us word unto Octavius’ tent
How everything is chanced.
