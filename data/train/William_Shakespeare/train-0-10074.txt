MARINA Whither wilt thou have me? BOULT To take from you the jewel you hold so dear. MARINA Prithee, tell me one thing first. BOULT Come, now, your one thing. What canst thou wish thine enemy to be? BOULT Why, I could wish him to be my master, or rather my mistress. Neither of these can be so bad as thou art,
Since they do better thee in their command.
Thou hold
Would not in reputation change with thee,
Thou damned doorkeeper to ev‘ry coistrel
That comes enquiring for his Tib.
To th’ choleric fisting of ev’ry rogue
Thy ear is liable. Thy food is such
As hath been belched on by infected lungs.
