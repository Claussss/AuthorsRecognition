Faith, and so we should, where now remains
A sweet reversion—we may boldly spend
Upon the hope of what is to come in.
A comfort of retirement lives in this. A rendezvous, a home to fly unto,
If that the devil and mischance look big
Upon the maidenhead of our affairs. But yet I would your father had been here. 60
The quality and hair of our attempt
Brooks no division. It will be thought
By some that know not why he is away
That wisdom, loyalty, and mere dislike
Of our proceedings kept the Earl from hence;
And think how such an apprehension
May turn the tide of fearful faction,
And breed a kind of question in our cause.
For, well you know, we of the off’ring side
Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement,
And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence
The eye of reason may pry in upon us.
This absence of your father’s draws a curtain
That shows the ignorant a kind of fear
Before not dreamt of.
