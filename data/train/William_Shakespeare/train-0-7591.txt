[Original Text (Munday)] [Addition Il (Heywood)] CLOWN BETTS Come, come, we’ll tickle their turnips, we’ll butter their boxes! Shall strangers rule the roast? Yes, but we’ll baste the roast. Come, come, aflaunt, aflaunt! GEORGE BETTS Brother, give place, and hear John Lincoln speak. CLOWN BETTS Ay, Lincoln, my leader,
And Doll, my true breeder,
With the rest of our crew
Shall ran-tan-tarra-ran.
Do all they what they can,
Shall we be bobbed, braved?—No!
Shall we be held under?—No)
We are free born
And do take scorn
To be used so.
