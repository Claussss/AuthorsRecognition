QUEEN ELIZABETH My words are dull. O quicken them with thine! QUEEN MARGARET Thy woes will make them sharp and pierce like mine. DUCHESS OF YORK Why should calamity be full of words? QUEEN ELIZABETH Windy attorneys to their client woes,
Airy recorders of intestate joys,
Poor breathing orators of miseries.
Let them have scope. Though what they will impart
Help nothing else, yet do they ease the heart.
