With silence, nephew, be thou politic.
Strong-fixed is the house of Lancaster,
And like a mountain, not to be removed.
But now thy uncle is removing hence,
As princes do their courts, when they are cloyed
With long continuance in a settled place. RICHARD PLANTAGENET O uncle, would some part of my young years
Might but redeem the passage of your age.
