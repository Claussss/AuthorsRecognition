FIRST WATCHMAN Why, noâ€”for he hath made a solemn vow
Never to lie and take his natural rest
Till Warwick or himself be quite suppressed. SECOND WATCHMAN Tomorrow then belike shall be the day,
If Warwick be so near as men report. THIRD WATCHMAN But say, I pray, what nobleman is that
That with the King here resteth in his tent?
