RICHARD GLOUCESTER So dear I loved the man that I must weep.
I took him for the plainest harmless creature
That breathed upon the earth, a Christian,
Made him my book wherein my soul recorded
The history of all her secret thoughts.
So smooth he daubed his vice with show of virtue
That, his apparent open guilt omitted—
I mean, his conversation with Shore’s wife—
He lived from all attainture of suspect.
