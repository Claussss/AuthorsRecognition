CARDINAL BEAUFORT No more of him—for I will deal with him
That henceforth he shall trouble us no more.
And so, break off; the day is almost spent.
Lord Suffolk, you and I must talk of that event. My lord of Suffolk, within fourteen days
At Bristol I expect my soldiers;
For there I’ll ship them all for Ireland.
