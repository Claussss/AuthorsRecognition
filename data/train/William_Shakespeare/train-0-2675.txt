Enter Lodowick My liege, the drum that struck the lusty march
Stands with Prince Edward, your thrice-valiant son. Enter Edward, Prince of Wales KING EDWARD I see the boy. Aside
Modelled in his, corrects my strayed desire,
And rates my heart, and chides my thievish eye,
Who, being rich enough in seeing her,
Yet seek elsewhere; and basest theft is that
Which cannot cloak itself in poverty.
(To the Prince) Now, boy, what news?
