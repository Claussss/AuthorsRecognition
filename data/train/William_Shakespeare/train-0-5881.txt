BURGUNDY God save your majesty. My royal cousin, teach you our princess English? KING HARRY I would have her learn, my fair cousin, how perfectly I love her, and that is good English. BURGUNDY Is she not apt? KING HARRY Our tongue is rough, coz, and my condition is not smooth, so that having neither the voice nor the heart of flattery about me I cannot so conjure up the spirit of love in her that he will appear in his true likeness.
