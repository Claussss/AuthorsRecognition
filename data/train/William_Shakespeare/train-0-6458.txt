2.1
Enter old Polonius with his man Reynaldo Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo. REYNALDO I will, my lord. You shall do marv’lous wisely, good Reynaldo,
Before you visit him to make enquire
Of his behaviour. My lord, I did intend it. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,
Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris,
And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
What company, at what expense; and finding
By this encompassment and drift of question
That they do know my son, come you more nearer
Than your particular demands will touch it.
Take you, as ‘twere, some distant knowledge of him,
As thus: ‘I know his father and his friends,
And in part him’—do you mark this, Reynaldo?
