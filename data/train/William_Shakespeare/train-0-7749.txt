[Original Text (Munday)] [Addition I (Chettle)] Now will I speak like More in melancholy;
For if griefs power could with her sharpest darts
Pierce my firm bosom, here’s sufficient cause
To take my farewell of mirth’s hurtless laws.
Poor humbled lady, thou that wert of late
Placed with the noblest women of the land,
Invited to their angel companies,
Seeming a bright star in the courtly sphere:
Why shouldst thou like a widow sit thus low,
And all thy fair consorts move from the clouds
That overdrip thy beauty and thy worth?
I’ll tell thee the true cause. The court, like heaven,
Examines not the anger of the prince,
And, being more frail-composed of gilded earth,
Shines upon them on whom the king doth shine,
Smiles if he smile, declines if he decline,
Yet, seeing both are mortal, court and king
Shed not one tear for any earthly thing.
For, so God pardon me, in my saddest hour
Thou hast no more occasion to lament,
Nor these, nor those, my exile from the court-
No, nor this body’s torture, were’t imposed,
As commonly disgraces of great men
Are the forewarnings of a hasty death—
Than to behold me after many a toil
Honoured with endless rest. Perchance the King,
Seeing the court is full of vanity,
Has pity lest our souls should be misled
And sends us to a life contemplative.
O, happy banishment from worldly pride,
When souls by private life are sanctified!
