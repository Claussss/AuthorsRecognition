Exeunt the Queens 
What are those? Men of great quality, as may be judged
By their appointment. Some of Thebes have told’s
They are sisters’ children, nephews to the King. By th’ helm of Mars I saw them in the war,
Like to a pair of lions smeared with prey,
Make lanes in troops aghast. I fixed my note
Constantly on them, for they were a mark
Worth a god’s view. What prisoner was’t that told me
When I enquired their names?
