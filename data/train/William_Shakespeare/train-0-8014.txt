Have you no countermand for Claudio yet,
But he must die tomorrow? PROVOST None, sir, none. As near the dawning, Provost, as it is,
You shall hear more ere morning. PROVOST Happily You something know, yet I believe there comes
No countermand. No such example have we;
Besides, upon the very siege of justice
Lord Angelo hath to the public ear
Professed the contrary.
