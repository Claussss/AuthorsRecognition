Enter Bassianus and Lavinia TAMORA (aside to Aaron) Ah, my sweet Moor, sweeter to me than life! AARON (aside to Tamora) No more, great Empress; Bassianus comes.
Be cross with him, and I’ll go fetch thy sons
To back thy quarrels, whatsoe’er they be. Exit Who have we here? Rome’s royal empress
Unfurnished of her well-beseeming troop?
Or is it Dian, habited like her
Who hath abandoned her holy groves
To see the general hunting in this forest?
