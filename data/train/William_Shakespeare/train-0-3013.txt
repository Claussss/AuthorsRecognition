ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Egeon, art thou not? Or else his ghost. DROMIO OF SYRACUSE O, my old master, who hath bound him here? Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds,
And gain a husband by his liberty.
Speak, old Egeon, if thou beest the man
That hadst a wife once called Emilia,
That bore thee at a burden two fair sons.
O, if thou beest the same Egeon, speak,
And speak unto the same Emilia.
