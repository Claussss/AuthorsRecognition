There is no question but this entertainment
Will be most honourable, most commodious.
I have oft heard good captains wish to have
Rich soldiers to attend them, such as would fight
Both for their lives and livings. Such a one
Is the good Emperor. I would to God
We had ten thousand of such able men.
Ha, then there would appear no court, no city,
But, where the wars were, they would pay
themselves.
Then, to prevent in French wars Englandâ€™s loss,
Let German flags wave with our English cross.
