KING DUNCAN Great happiness. Sweno, the Norways’ king, craves composition;
Nor would we deign him burial of his men
Till he disbursed at Saint Colum’s inch
Ten thousand dollars to our general use. KING DUNCAN No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive
Our bosom interest. Go pronounce his present death,
And with his former title greet Macbeth.
