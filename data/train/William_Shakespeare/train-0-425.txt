Exit a Servingman I know the boy will well usurp the grace,
Voice, gait, and action of a gentlewoman.
I long to hear him call the drunkard husband,
And how my men will stay themselves from laughter
When they do homage to this simple peasant.
Iâ€™ll in to counsel them. Haply my presence
May well abate the over-merry spleen
Which otherwise would grow into extremes.
