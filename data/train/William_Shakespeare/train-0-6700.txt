Enter King Claudius, Queen Gertrude, Laertes, and
lords, with Osric and other attendants with
trumpets, drums, cushions, foils, and gauntlets; a
table, and flagons of wine on it KING CLAUDIUS Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me. HAMLET (to Laertes) Give me your pardon, sir. I’ve done you wrong;
But pardon’t as you are a gentleman.
This presence knows,
And you must needs have heard, how I am punished
With sore distraction. What I have done
That might your nature, honour, and exception
Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
Was’t Hamlet wronged Laertes? Never Hamlet.
If Hamlet from himself be ta‘en away,
And when he’s not himself does wrong Laertes,
Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
Who does it then? His madness. If’t be so,
Hamlet is of the faction that is wronged.
His madness is poor Hamlet’s enemy.
Sir, in this audience
Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil
Free me so far in your most generous thoughts
That I have shot mine arrow o’er the house
And hurt my brother.
