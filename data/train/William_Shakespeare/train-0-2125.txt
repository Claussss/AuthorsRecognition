QUEEN ELIZABETH (rising) O thou, well skilled in curses, stay a while,
And teach me how to curse mine enemies. QUEEN MARGARET Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days;
Compare dead happiness with living woe;
Think that thy babes were sweeter than they were,
And he that slew them fouler than he is.
Bettâ€™ring thy loss makes the bad causer worse.
Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
