IAGO What is the matter, lady? Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her,
Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her,
That true hearts cannot bear it. DESDEMONA Am I that name, Iago? IAGO What name, fair lady? Such as she said my lord did say I was. He called her whore. A beggar in his drink
Could not have laid such terms upon his callet.
