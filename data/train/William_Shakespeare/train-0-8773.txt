PAINTER (showing the picture) ’Tis a good piece. So ’tis. This comes off well and excellent. Indifferent. POET Admirable. How this grace Speaks his own standing! What a mental power
This eye shoots forth! How big imagination
Moves in this lip! To th’ dumbness of the gesture
One might interpret. It is a pretty mocking of the life.
Here is a touch; is’t good?
