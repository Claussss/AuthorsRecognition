Yield, my lord Protector; yield, Winchester—
Except you mean with obstinate repulse
To slay your sovereign and destroy the realm.
You see what mischief-and what murder, too—
Hath been enacted through your enmity.
Then be at peace, except ye thirst for blood. He shall submit, or I will never yield. Compassion on the King commands me stoop,
Or I would see his heart out ere the priest
Should ever get that privilege of me.
