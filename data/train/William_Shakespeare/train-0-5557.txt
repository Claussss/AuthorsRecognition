CLAUDIO Leonato, stand I here?
Is this the Prince? Is this the Prince’s brother?
Is this face Hero’s? Are our eyes our own? All this is so. But what of this, my lord? Let me but move one question to your daughter,
And by that fatherly and kindly power
That you have in her, bid her answer truly. LEONATO (to Hero)
