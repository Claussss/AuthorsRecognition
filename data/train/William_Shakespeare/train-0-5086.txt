Why should the gentleman that rode by Travers
Give then such instances of loss? LORD BARDOLPH Who, he? He was some hilding fellow that had stol’n
The horse he rode on, and, upon my life,
Spoke at a venture. Enter Morton Look, here comes more news. NORTHUMBERLAND Yea, this man’s brow, like to a title leaf,
Foretells the nature of a tragic volume.
So looks the strand whereon the imperious flood
Hath left a witnessed usurpation.
Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury?
