Then leave me not, my lords. Be resolute—
I mean to take possession of my right. Neither the King nor he that loves him best—
The proudest he that holds up Lancaster—
Dares stir a wing if Warwick shake his bells.
I’ll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares.
Resolve thee, Richard—claim the English crown.
