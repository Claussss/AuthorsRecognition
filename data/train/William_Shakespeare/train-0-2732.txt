KING EDWARD Rescue, Artois? What, is he prisoner,
Or fell by violence beside his horse? COMTE D’ARTOIS Neither, my lord, but narrowly beset
With turning Frenchmen, whom he did pursue,
As ’tis impossible that he should scape
Except your highness presently descend. KING EDWARD Tut, let him fight. We gave him arms today,
And he is labouring for a knighthood, man!
