Who doth ambition shun,
 And loves to live i’th’ sun,
Seeking the food he eats
And pleased with what he gets, Come hither, come hither, come hither. Here shall he see
No enemy But winter and rough weather. JAQUES I’ll give you a verse to this note that I made yesterday in despite of my invention. AMIENS And I’ll sing it.
