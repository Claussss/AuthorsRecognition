PANDARUS I speak no more than truth. TROILUS Thou dost not speak so much. PANDARUS Faith, I’ll not meddle in it. Let her be as she is. If she be fair, ’tis the better for her; an she be not, she has the mends in her own hands. TROILUS Good Pandarus, how now, Pandarus! PANDARUS I have had my labour for my travail. Ill thought on of her and ill thought on of you. Gone between and between, but small thanks for my labour.
