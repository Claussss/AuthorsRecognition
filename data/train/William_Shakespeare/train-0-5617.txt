I thank thee for thy care and honest pains. DOGBERRY Your worship speaks like a most thankful and reverend youth, and I praise God for you. LEONATO (giving him money) Thereâ€™s for thy pains. DOGBERRY God save the foundation. LEONATO Go. I discharge thee of thy prisoner, and I thank thee. DOGBERRY I leave an arrant knave with your worship, which I beseech your worship to correct yourself, for the example of others. God keep your worship, I wish your worship well. God restore you to health. I humbly give you leave to depart, and if a merry meeting may be wished, God prohibit it. Come, neighbour.
