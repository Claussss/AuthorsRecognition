BELARIUS (aside) O noble strain! O worthiness of nature, breed of greatness!
Cowards father cowards, and base things sire base.
Nature hath meal and bran, contempt and grace.
I’m not their father, yet who this should be
Doth miracle itself, loved before me.
(Aloud) ‘Tis the ninth hour o’th’ morn. ARVIRAGUS (to Innogen)
