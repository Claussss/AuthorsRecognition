I thank you. You shall hear from me anon.
Go not away. (To Painter) What have you there, my
friend? A piece of painting, which I do beseech
Your lordship to accept. TIMON Painting is welcome. The painting is almost the natural man;
For since dishonour traffics with manâ€™s nature,
He is but outside; these pencilled figures are
Even such as they give out. I like your work,
And you shall find I like it. Wait attendance
Till you hear further from me.
