Exit Messenger Why, this is cheerful news. Friends go and come.
Reverend Erasmus, whose delicious words
Express the very soul and life of wit,
Newly took sad leave of me, with tears
Troubled the silver channel of the Thames,
Which, glad of such a burden, proudly swelled
And on her bosom bore him toward the sea.
He’s gone to Rotterdam. Peace go with him!
He left me heavy when he went from hence,
But this recomforts me. The kind Lord Mayor,
His brethren aldermen, with their fair wives
Will feast this night with us. Why, so’t should be.
More’s merry heart lives by good company.
