Philip of France, on peril of a curse,
Let go the hand of that arch-heretic,
And raise the power of France upon his head,
Unless he do submit himself to Rome. 120 QUEEN ELEANOR Lookâ€™st thou pale, France? Do not let go thy hand. CONSTANCE to King John Look to it, devil, lest that France repent,
And by disjoining hands hell lose a soul.
