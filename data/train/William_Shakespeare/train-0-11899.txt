Fetch me a dozen crab-tree staves, and strong ones,
Raising his rushes (To those within) I’ll scratch your heads. You must be seeing christenings? Do you look
For ale and cakes here, you rude rascals? Pray, sir, be patient. ’Tis as much impossible,
Unless we sweep ’em from the door with cannons,
To scatter ’em as ’tis to make ’em sleep
On May-day morning—which will never be.
We may as well push against Paul’s as stir ’em.
