Had he his hurts before? Ay, on the front. Why then, God’s soldier be he. Had I as many sons as I have hairs
I would not wish them to a fairer death;
And so his knell is knolled. He’s worth more sorrow, And that I’ll spend for him. He’s worth no more. They say he parted well and paid his score,
And so God be with him. Here comes newer comfort.
Enter Macduff with Macbeth’s head
