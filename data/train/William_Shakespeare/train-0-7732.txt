Why ask you that, dear madam? Because tonight I had the strangest dream
That e‘er my sleep was troubled with.
Methought ’twas night,
And that the King and Queen went on the Thames
In barges to hear music. My lord and I
Were in a little boat, methought—Lord, Lord,
What strange things live in slumbers!—and being near,
We grappled to the barge that bare the King;
But after many pleasing voices spent
In that still-moving music house, methought
The violence of the stream did sever us
Quite from the golden fleet and hurried us
Unto the Bridge which, with unused horror,
We entered at full tide; thence some flight shoot
Being carried by the waves, our boat stood still
Just opposite the Tower; and there it turned
And turned about, as when a whirlpool sucks
The circled waters. Methought that we both cried,
Till that we sunk, where arm in arm we died.
