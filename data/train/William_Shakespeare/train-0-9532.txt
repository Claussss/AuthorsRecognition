What, of death too, That rids our dogs of languish? Do not abuse my master’s bounty by
Th’undoing of yourself. Let the world see
His nobleness well acted, which your death
Will never let come forth. Where art thou, death? Come hither, come. Come, come, and take a queen
Worth many babes and beggars. O temperance, lady!
