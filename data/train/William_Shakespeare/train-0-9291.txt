Enter Varrius How now, Varrius? This is most certain that I shall deliver:
Mark Antony is every hour in Rome
Expected. Since he went from Egypt, ’tis
A space for farther travel. I could have given less matter A better ear. Menas, I did not think
This amorous surfeiter would have donned his helm
For such a petty war. His soldiership
Is twice the other twain. But let us rear
The higher our opinion, that our stirring
Can from the lap of Egypt’s widow pluck
The ne’er lust-wearied Antony.
