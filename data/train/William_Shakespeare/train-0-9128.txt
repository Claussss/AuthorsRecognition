SPIRIT within Where’s Puckle? ANOTHER SPIRIT within OTHER SPIRITS within And Hoppo, too, and Hellwain, too,
We lack but you, we lack but you.
Come away, make up the count. I will but ’noint, and then I mount.
Spirits appear above.A Spirit like a Cat descends SPIRITS above There’s one comes down to fetch his dues,
A kiss, a coll, a sip of blood,
And why thou stay’st so long I muse, I muse,
Since the air’s so sweet and good.
