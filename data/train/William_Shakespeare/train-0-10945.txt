Tray, Blanch, and Sweetheart—see, they bark at me. EDGAR Tom will throw his head at them.—Avaunt, you curs! Be thy mouth or black or white,
Tooth that poisons if it bite,
Mastiff, greyhound, mongrel grim,
Hound or spaniel, brach or him,
Bobtail tyke or trundle-tail,
Tom will make him weep and wail;
For with throwing thus my head,
Dogs leapt the hatch, and all are fled.
