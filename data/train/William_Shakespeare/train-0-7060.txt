ULYSSES Agamemnon, Thou great commander, nerve and bone of Greece,
Heart of our numbers, soul and only spirit
In whom the tempers and the minds of all
Should be shut up, hear what Ulysses speaks.
Besides th’applause and approbation
The which, (to Agamemnon) most mighty for thy place
and sway,
And thou, (to Nestor) most reverend for thy stretched-out
life,
I give to both your speeches—which were such
As, Agamemnon, every hand of Greece
Should hold up high in brass, and such again
As, venerable Nestor, hatched in silver,
Should with a bond of air, strong as the axle-tree
On which the heavens ride, knit all Greeks’ ears
To his experienced tongue—yet let it please both,
Thou (to Agamemnon) great, and (to Nestor) wise, to
hear Ulysses speak.
