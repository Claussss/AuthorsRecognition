BOTTOM (as Pyramus) Not Shaphalus to Procrus was so true. FLUTE (as Thisbe) As Shaphalus to Procrus, I to you. BOTTOM (as Pyramus) O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall. FLUTE (as Thisbe) I kiss the wall’s hole, not your lips at all. BOTTOM (as Pyramus) Wilt thou at Ninny’s tomb meet me straightway?
