So should the murdered look, and so should I,
Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty.
Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear
As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere. Whatâ€™s this to my Lysander? Where is he?
Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me? I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.
