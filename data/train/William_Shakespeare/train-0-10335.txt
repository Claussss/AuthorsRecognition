BRUTUS How accompanied? With old Menenius, and those senators That always favoured him. SICINIUS Have you a catalogue Of all the voices that we have procured,
Set down by th’ poll? AEDILE I have, ’tis ready. Have you collected them by tribes? AEDILE I have. Assemble presently the people hither,
And when they hear me say ‘It shall be so
I’th’ right and strength o‘th’ commons’, be it either
For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them,
If I say ‘Fine’, cry ‘Fine!’, if ‘Death’, cry ‘Death!’,
Insisting on the old prerogative
And power i‘th’ truth o’th’ cause.
