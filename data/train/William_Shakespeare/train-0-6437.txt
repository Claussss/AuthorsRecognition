He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
Of his affection to me. Affection, pooh! You speak like a green girl
Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
Do you believe his ‘tenders’ as you call them? I do not know, my lord, what I should think. Marry, I’ll teach you: think yourself a baby
That you have ta’en his tenders for true pay,
Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
Or—not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
Running it thus—you’ll tender me a fool.
