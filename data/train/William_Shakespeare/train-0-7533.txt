Ten in the hundred here lies engraved;
A hundred to ten his soul is not saved.
If anyone ask who lies in this tomb,
‘O ho!’ quoth the devil, “tis my John-a-Combe.’ 
 Another Epitaph on John Combe He being dead, and making the poor his heirs, William
Shakespeare after writes this for his epitaph:
Howe’er he lived judge not,
John Combe shall never be forgot
While poor hath memory, for he did gather
To make the poor his issue; he, their father,
As record of his tilth and seed 5
Did crown him in his latter deed.
