Thou bleed’st apace. I had a wound here that was like a T,
But now ’tis made an H. Retreat sounded far off They do retire. We’ll beat ’em into bench-holes. I have yet
Room for six scotches more. They are beaten, sir, and our advantage serves
For a fair victory. Let us score their backs And snatch ‘em up as we take hares, behind.
’Tis sport to maul a runner.
