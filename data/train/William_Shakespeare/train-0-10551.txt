PAULINA You need not fear it, sir. This child was prisoner to the womb, and is
By law and process of great nature thence
Freed and enfranchised, not a party to
The anger of the King, nor guilty of—
If any be—the trespass of the Queen. JAILER I do believe it. Do not you fear. Upon mine honour,
I will stand twixt you and danger.
