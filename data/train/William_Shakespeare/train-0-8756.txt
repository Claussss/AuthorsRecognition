Exeunt some with Edmund
Enter King Lear with Queen Cordelia in his arms,
[followed by the Second Captain] Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stones.
Had I your tongues and eyes, I would use them so
That heaven’s vault should crack. She’s gone for ever.
I know when one is dead and when one lives.
She’s dead as earth.
[He lays her down]
Lend me a looking-glass.
If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,
Why, then she lives.
