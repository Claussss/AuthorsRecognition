SUFFOLK aside O, wert thou for myself!—but Suffolk, stay.
Thou mayst not wander in that labyrinth.
There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk.
Solicit Henry with her wondrous praise.
Bethink thee on her virtues that surmount,
Mad natural graces that extinguish art.
Repeat their semblance often on the seas,
That when thou com’st to kneel at Henry’s feet
Thou mayst bereave him of his wits with wonder.
