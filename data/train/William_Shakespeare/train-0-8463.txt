This is most strange, that she that even but now
Was your best object, the argument of your praise,
Balm of your age, most best, most dearest,
Should in this trice of time commit a thing
So monstrous to dismantle
So many folds of favour. Sure, her offence
Must be of such unnatural degree
That monsters it, or your fore-vouched affections
Fallâ€™n into taint; which to believe of her
Must be a faith that reason without miracle
Could never plant in me.
