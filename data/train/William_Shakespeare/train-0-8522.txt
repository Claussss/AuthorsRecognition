GONORIL Do you mark that, my lord? I cannot be so partial, Gonoril,
To the great love I bear you— GONORIL Come, sir, no more.— You, more knave than fool, after your master! FOOL Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry, and take the fool with thee. A fox when one has caught her,
And such a daughter,
Should sure to the slaughter,
If my cap would buy a halter.
So, the fool follows after.
