From both, my lord. Bellario greets your grace. She gives a letter to the Duke. Shylock whets his knife on his shoe BASSANIO (to Shylock) Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly? To cut the forfeit from that bankrupt there. Not on thy sole but on thy soul, harsh Jew,
Thou mak’st thy knife keen. But no metal can,
No, not the hangman’s axe, bear half the keenness
Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?
