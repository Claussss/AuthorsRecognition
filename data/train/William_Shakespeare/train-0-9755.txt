INTERPRETER Boskos vauvado.— I understand thee, and can speak thy tongue.—
Kerelybonto.—Sir,
Betake thee to thy faith, for seventeen poniards
Are at thy bosom. INTERPRETER O pray, pray, pray!— Manka revania dulche? 80 Oscorbidulchos volivorco. INTERPRETER The general is content to spare thee yet,
And, hoodwinked as thou art, will lead thee on
To gather from thee. Haply thou mayst inform
Something to save thy life.
