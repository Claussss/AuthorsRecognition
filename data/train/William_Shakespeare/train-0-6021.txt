Exeunt with Caesar’s body 
 3.2
Enter Brutus and Cassius, with the Plebeians 
ALL THE PLEBEIANS We will be satisfied! Let us be satisfied! Then follow me, and give me audience, friends.
(Aside to Cassius) Cassius, go you into the other street,
And part the numbers.
(To the Plebeians)
Those that will hear me speak, let ’em stay here;
Those that will follow Cassius, go with him;
And public reasons shall be rendered
Of Caesar’s death.
