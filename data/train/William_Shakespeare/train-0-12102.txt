FIRST FRIEND JAILER’S DAUGHTER There is at least two hundred now with child by him,
There must be four; yet I keep close for all this,
Close as a cockle; and all these must be boys—
He has the trick on’t—and at ten years old
They must be all gelt for musicians
And sing the wars of Theseus. SECOND FRIEND
