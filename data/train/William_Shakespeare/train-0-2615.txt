Enter below David King of Scotland and Sir William Douglas with  (Aside) I must withdraw. The everlasting foe
Comes to the wall. I’ll closely step aside
And list their babble, blunt and full of pride. The Countess withdraws KING OF SCOTLAND My lord of Lorraine, to our brother of France
Commend us as the man in Christendom
That we most reverence and entirely love.
Touching your embassage, return and say
That we with England will not enter parley,
Nor never make fair weather, or take truce,
But burn their neighbour towns, and so persist
With eager roads beyond their city York;
And never shall our bonny riders rest,
Nor rusting canker have the time to eat
Their light-borne snaffle, nor their nimble spur,
Nor lay aside their jacks of gimmaled mail,
Nor hang their staves of grained Scottish ash
In peaceful wise upon their city walls,
Nor from their buttoned tawny leathern belts
Dismiss their biting whinyards, till your King
Cry out, ‘Enough! Spare England now for pity!’
Farewell, and tell him that you leave us here,
Before this castle; say you came from us
Even when we had that yielded to our hands.
