Let us go. Come. Our separation so abides and flies
That thou residing here goes yet with me,
And I hence fleeting, here remain with thee.
Away. Exeunt severally 
1.4
Enter Octavius reading a letter, Lepidus, and their train You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,
It is not Caesarâ€™s natural vice to hate
Our great competitor. From Alexandria
This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes
The lamps of night in revel; is not more manlike
Than Cleopatra, nor the queen of Ptolemy
More womanly than he; hardly gave audience
Or vouchsafed to think he had partners. You shall find
there
A man who is the abstract of all faults
That all men follow.
