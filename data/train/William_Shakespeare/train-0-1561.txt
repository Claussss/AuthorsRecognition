Enter Fiends This speed and quick appearance argues proof
Of your accustomed diligence to me.
Now, ye familiar spirits that are culled
Out of the powerful regions under earth,
Help me this once, that France may get the field. They walk and speak not O, hold me not with silence overlong!
Where I was wont to feed you with my blood,
Iâ€™ll lop a member off and give it you
In earnest of a further benefit,
So you do condescend to help me now.
