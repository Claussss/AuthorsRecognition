Let me beseech your grace not to do so.
His fault is much, and the good King his master
Will check him for’t. Your purposed low correction
Is such as basest and contemn
For pilf’rings and most common trespasses
Are punished with. The King must take it ill
That he’s so slightly valued in his messenger,
Should have him thus restrained.
