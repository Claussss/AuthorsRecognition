Enter Don John and Borachio 
DON JOHN It is so. The Count Claudio shall marry the daughter of Leonato. BORACHIO Yea, my lord, but I can cross it. DON JOHN Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be medicinable to me. I am sick in displeasure to him, and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges evenly with mine. How canst thou cross this marriage?
