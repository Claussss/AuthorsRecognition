DUCHESS OF YORK Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother Clarence?
And little Ned Plantagenet his son? QUEEN ELIZABETH Where is the gentle Rivers, Vaughan, Gray? DUCHESS OF YORK Where is kind Hastings? KING RICHARD (to his train) A flourish, trumpets! Strike alarum, drums!
Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women
Rail on the Lordâ€™s anointed. Strike, I say!
