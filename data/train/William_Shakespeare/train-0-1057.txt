Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not. EXETER (to King Henry) They seek revenge and therefore will not yield. Ah, Exeter. WARWICK Why should you sigh, my lord? Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son,
Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit.
But be it as it may. (To York) I here entail
The crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever,
Conditionally, that here thou take thine oath
To cease this civil war, and whilst I live
To honour me as thy king and sovereign,
And nor by treason nor hostility
To seek to put me down and reign thyself.
