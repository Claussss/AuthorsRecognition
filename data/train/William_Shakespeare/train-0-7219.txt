TROILUS No remedy. A woeful Cressid ’mongst the merry Greeks!
When shall we see again? Hear me, my love: be thou but true of heart— I true? How now! What wicked deem is this? Nay, we must use expostulation kindly,
For it is parting from us.
I speak not ‘Be thou true’ as fearing thee—
For I will throw my glove to Death himself
That there’s no maculation in thy heart—
But ‘Be thou true’ say I, to fashion in
My sequent protestation: ‘Be thou true,
And I will see thee’.
