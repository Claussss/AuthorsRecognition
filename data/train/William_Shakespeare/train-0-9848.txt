She hath that ring of yours. I think she has. Certain it is I liked her
And boarded her i‘th’ wanton way of youth.
She knew her distance and did angle for me,
Madding my eagerness with her restraint,
As all impediments in fancy’s course
Are motives of more fancy; and in fine
Her inf’nite cunning with her modern grace
Subdued me to her rate. She got the ring,
And I had that which my inferior might
At market price have bought.
