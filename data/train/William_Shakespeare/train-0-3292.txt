1.1
Enter King Richard and John of Gaunt, with the Lord Marshal, other nobles, and attendants 
KING RICHARD
Old John of Gaunt, time-honoured Lancaster,
Hast thou according to thy oath and bond
Brought hither Henry Hereford, thy bold son,
Here to make good the boistâ€™rous late appeal,
Which then our leisure would not let us hear,
Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?
