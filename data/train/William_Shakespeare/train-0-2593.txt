When they had sworn to this advised doom
They did conclude to bear dead Lucrece thence,
To show her bleeding body thorough Rome,
And so to publish Tarquin’s foul offence;
Which being done with speedy diligence, The Romans plausibly did give consent
To Tarquin’s everlasting banishment. BY WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE AND OTHERS
