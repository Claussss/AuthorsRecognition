FRIAR LAURENCE O, then I see that madmen have no ears. How should they, when that wise men have no eyes? FRIAR LAURENCE Let me dispute with thee of thy estate. Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.
Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,

And fall upon the ground, as I do now,

Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
