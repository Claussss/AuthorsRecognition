Well, sit you out. Go home, Biron. Adieu. No, my good lord, I have sworn to stay with you.
And though I have for barbarism spoke more
Than for that angel knowledge you can say,
Yet confident I’ll keep what I have sworn,
And bide the penance of each three years’ day.
Give me the paper. Let me read the same,
And to the strict’st decrees I’ll write my name.
