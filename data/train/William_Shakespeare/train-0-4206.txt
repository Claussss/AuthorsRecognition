Murder, as hating what himself hath done,
Doth lay it open to urge on revenge. Or when he doomed this beauty to a grave,
Found it too precious-princely fora grave. 40 SALISBURY (to the Bastard) Sir Richard, what think you? You have beheld.
Or have you read or heard; or could you think,
Or do you almost think, although you see,
That you do see? Could thought, without this object,
Form such another? This is the very top,
The height, the crest, or crest unto the crest,
Of murderâ€™s arms; this is the bloodiest shame,
The wildest savagery, the vilest stroke
That ever wall-eyed wrath or staring rage
Presented to the tears of soft remorse.
