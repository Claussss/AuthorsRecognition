He’s the devil. Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour, poisoned
With only suff‘ring stain by him, for him
Shall fly out of itself. Nor sleep nor sanctuary,
Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,
The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice—
Embargements all of fury—shall lift up
Their rotten privilege and custom ’gainst
My hate to Martius. Where I find him, were it
At home upon my brother’s guard, even there,
Against the hospitable canon, would I
Wash my fierce hand in’s heart. Go you to th’ city.
Learn how ’tis held, and what they are that must
Be hostages for Rome.
