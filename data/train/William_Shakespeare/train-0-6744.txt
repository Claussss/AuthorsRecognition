Musicians, sailors, lords, attendants 
Twelfth Night, or What You Will  1.1
Music. Enter Orsino Duke of Illyria, Curio, and other lords If music be the food of love, play on,
Give me excess of it that, surfeiting,
The appetite may sicken and so die.
That strain again, it had a dying fall.
O, it came o‘er my ear like the sweet sound
That breathes upon a bank of violets,
Stealing and giving odour. Enough, no more,
’Tis not so sweet now as it was before.
