2.1
Enter Angelo, Escalus, and servants; a Justice We must not make a scarecrow of the law,
Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,
And let it keep one shape till custom make it
Their perch, and not their terror. Ay, but yet Let us be keen, and rather cut a little
Than fall and bruise to death. Alas, this gentleman
Whom I would save had a most noble father.
Let but your honour know—
Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue—
That in the working of your own affections,
Had time cohered with place, or place with wishing,
Or that the resolute acting of your blood
Could have attained th’effect of your own purpose—
Whether you had not sometime in your life
Erred in this point which now you censure him,
And pulled the law upon you.
