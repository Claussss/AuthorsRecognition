O my noble brother,
 That oath was rashly made, and in your anger.
Your reason will not hold it. If such vows
Stand for express will, all the world must perish.
Beside, I have another oath ’gainst yours,
Of more authority, I am sure more love—
Not made in passion, neither, but good heed. What is it, sister?
