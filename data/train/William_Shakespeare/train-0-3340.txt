My lord, no leave take I, for I will ride
As far as land will let me by your side. JOHN OF GAUNT (to Bolingbroke) O, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words,
That thou return’st no greeting to thy friends? BOLINGBROKE I have too few to take my leave of you,
When the tongue’s office should be prodigal
To breathe the abundant dolour of the heart.
