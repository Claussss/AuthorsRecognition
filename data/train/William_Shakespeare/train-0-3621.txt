JULIET Ay me. ROMEO (aside) She speaks. O, speak again, bright angel; for thou art
As glorious to this night, being o‘er my head,
As is a winged messenger of heaven
Unto the white upturned wond’ring eyes
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
When he bestrides the lazy-passing clouds
And sails upon the bosom of the air.
