Enter Decius Hereâ€™s Decius Brutus; he shall tell them so. Calpurnia rises Caesar, all hail! Good morrow, worthy Caesar.
I come to fetch you to the Senate House. And you are come in very happy time
To bear my greeting to the senators
And tell them that I will not come today.
Cannot is false, and that I dare not, falser.
I will not come today; tell them so, Decius.
