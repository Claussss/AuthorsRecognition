HORSE-KEEPER Before God, they are very sad. I doubt my lord is condemned. PORTER God bless his soul, and a fig then for all worldly condemnation! Well said, Giles Porter, I commend thee for it.
â€™Twas spoken like a well-affected servant
Of him that was a kind lord to us all. Which now no more he shall be, for, dear fellows,
Now we are masterless. Though he may live
So long as please the King, but law hath made him
A dead man to the world, and given the axe his head,
But his sweet soul to live among the saints.
