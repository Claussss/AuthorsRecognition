ROMEO Whither? ROMEO Whose house? Indeed, I should have asked thee that before. 
the great rich Capulet, and if you be not of the house
of Montagues, I pray come and crush a cup of wine.
Rest you merry. Exit At this same ancient feast of Capuletâ€™s
Sups the fair Rosaline, whom thou so loves,
With all the admir
Go thither, and with unattainted eye
Compare her face with some that I shall show,
And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
