Wherein she framed thee, in high heaven’s despite,
To shame the sun by day and her by night. ‘And therefore hath she bribed the destinies
To cross the curious workmanship of nature,
To mingle beauty with infirmities,
And pure perfection with impure defeature, Making it subject to the tyranny
Of mad mischances and much misery;
