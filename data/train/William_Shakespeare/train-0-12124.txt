They have a noble work in hand, will honour
The very powers that love ’em. Enter Palamon with his three Knights at one door, and Arcite with his three Knights at the other door Sir, they enter. You valiant and strong-hearted enemies,
You royal german foes that this day come
To blow that nearness out that flames between ye,
Lay by your anger for an hour and, dove-like,
Before the holy altars of your helpers,
The all-feared gods, bow down your stubborn bodies.
Your ire is more than mortal—so your help be;
And as the gods regard ye, fight with justice.
I’ll leave you to your prayers, and betwixt ye
I part my wishes.
