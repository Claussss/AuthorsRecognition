THALIART (aside) What from Antioch? Royal Antiochus, on what cause I know not,
Took some displeasure at him—at least he judged so—
And doubting lest that he had erred or sinned,
To show his sorrow he’d correct himself;
So puts himself unto the ship-man’s toil,
With whom each minute threatens life or death.
