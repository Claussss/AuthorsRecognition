This beauteous combat, wilful and unwilling,
Showed like two silver doves that sit a-billing. Once more the engine of her thoughts began:
‘O fairest mover on this mortal round,
Would thou wert as I am, and I am an,
My heart all whole as thine, thy heart my wound; For one sweet look thy help I would assure thee,
Though nothing but my body’s bane would cure
thee.’
