HECTOR How now! How now! TROILUS For th’ love of all the gods, Let’s leave the hermit pity with our mother
And, when we have our armours buckled on,
The venomed vengeance ride upon our swords,
Spur them to ruthful work, rein them from ruth. Fie, savage, fie! TROILUS Hector, then ’tis wars. Troilus, I would not have you fight today.
