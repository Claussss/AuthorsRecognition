VOLUMNIA My first son, Whither will thou go? Take good Cominius
With thee a while. Determine on some course
More than a wild exposure to each chance
That starts i’th’ way before thee. I’ll follow thee a month, devise with thee
Where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us
And we of thee. So, if the time thrust forth
A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send
O‘er the vast world to seek a single man,
And lose advantage, which doth ever cool
I’th’ absence of the needer.
