Enter Beatrice By this day, sheâ€™s a fair lady. I do spy some marks of love in her. BEATRICE Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner. BENEDICK Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains. BEATRICE I took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me. If it had been painful I would not have come.
