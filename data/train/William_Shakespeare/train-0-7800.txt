HANGMAN I’ll take an order for that, my lord. MORE One thing more: take heed thou cutt’st not off my beard. O, I forgot, execution passed upon that last night, and the body of it lies buried in the Tower. Stay, is’t not possible to make a scape from all this strong guard? It is. There is a thing within me that will raise
And elevate my better part ’bove sight
Of these same weaker eyes. And Master Sheriffs,
For all this troop of steel that tends my death,
I shall break from you and fly up to heaven.
Let’s seek the means for this.
