DUCHESS OF YORK Who meets us here? My niece Plantagenet,
Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?
Now for my life, she’s wand’ring to the Tower,
On pure heart’s love, to greet the tender Prince.—
Daughter, well met. God give your graces both 5 A happy and a joyful time of day. QUEEN ELIZABETH
