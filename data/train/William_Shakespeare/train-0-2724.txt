Fight and be valiant; conquer where thou com’st.
(To Derby, Audley and Artois) Now follow, lords, and do him honour too. EARL OF DERBY Edward Plantagenet, Prince of Wales,
As I do set this helmet on thy head
Wherewith the chamber of thy brain is fenced,
So may thy temples with Bellona’s hand
Be still adorned with laurel victory.
