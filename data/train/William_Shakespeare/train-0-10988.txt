Now fare ye well, good sir. He stands aside With all my heart. EDGAR (aside) Why I do trifle thus with his despair
Is done to cure it. GLOUCESTER (keeling) O you mighty gods, This world I do renounce, and in your sights
Shake patiently my great affliction off!
If I could bear it longer, and not fall
To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,
My snuff and loathed part of nature should
Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O bless him!â€”
Now, fellow, fare thee well.
