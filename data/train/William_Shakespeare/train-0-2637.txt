LODOWICK Write I to a woman? KING EDWARD What beauty else could triumph over me,
Or who but women do our love-lays greet?
What think’st thou I did bid thee praise? A horse? Of what condition or estate she is
’Twere requisite that I should know, my lord. KING EDWARD Of such estate that hers is as a throne,
And my estate the footstool where she treads.
Then mayst thou judge what her condition is
By the proportion of her mightiness.
Write on, while I peruse her in my thoughts.
