RICHARD PLANTAGENET Now, by this maiden blossom in my hand,
I scorn thee and thy fashion, peevish boy. Turn not thy scorns this way, Plantagenet. RICHARD PLANTAGENET Proud Pole, I will, and scorn both him and thee. Iâ€™ll turn my part thereof into thy throat. Away, away, good William de la Pole.
We grace the yeoman by conversing with him.
