TRINCULO A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder of a poor drunkard! CALIBAN (to Stefano) I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow,
And I with my long nails will dig thee pig-nuts,
Show thee a jay’s nest, and instruct thee how
To snare the nimble marmoset. I’ll bring thee
To clust’ring filberts, and sometimes I’ll get thee
Young seamews from the rock. Wilt thou go with
me?
