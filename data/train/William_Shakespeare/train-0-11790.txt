CARDINAL WOLSEY For holy offices I have a time; a time
To think upon the part of business which
I bear i’th’ state; and nature does require
Her times of preservation which, perforce,
I, her frail son, amongst my brethren mortal,
Must give my tendance to. You have said well. CARDINAL WOLSEY And ever may your highness yoke together,
As I will lend you cause, my doing well
With my well-saying.
