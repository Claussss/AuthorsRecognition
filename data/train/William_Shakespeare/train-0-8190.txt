IAGO Ay, madam. I am not merry, but I do beguile
The thing I am by seeming otherwise.
Come, how wouldst thou praise me? I am about it, but indeed my invention
Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frieze—
It plucks out brains and all. But my muse labours,
And thus she is delivered:
If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,
The one’s for use, the other useth it.
