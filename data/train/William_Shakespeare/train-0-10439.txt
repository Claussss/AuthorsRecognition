viraiha kisses him O, a kiss
Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!
Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss
I carried from thee, dear, and my true lip
Hath virgined it e‘er since. You gods, I prate,
And the most noble mother of the world
Leave unsaluted! Sink, my knee, i’th’ earth.  Of thy deep duty more impression show
Than that of common sons.
