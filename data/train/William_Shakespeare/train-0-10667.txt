PERDITA (to Florizel) How often have I told you ‘twould be thus?
How often said my dignity would last
But till ’twere known? It cannot fail but by The violation of my faith, and then
Let nature crush the sides o’th’ earth together
And mar the seeds within. Lift up thy looks.
From my succession wipe me, father! I
Am heir to my affection.
