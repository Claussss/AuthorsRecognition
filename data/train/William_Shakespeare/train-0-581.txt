Nathaniel’s coat, sir, was not fully made,
And Gabriel’s pumps were all unpinked i‘th’ heel.
There was no link to colour Peter’s hat,
And Walter’s dagger was not come from sheathing.
There were none fine but Adam, Ralph, and Gregory.
The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly.
Yet as they are, here are they come to meet you.
