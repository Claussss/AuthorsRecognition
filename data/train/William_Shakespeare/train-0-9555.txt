CLEOPATRA Get thee hence, farewell. CLOWN I wish you all joy of the worm. CLEOPATRA Farewell. CLOWN You must think this, look you, that the worm will do his kind. CLEOPATRA Ay, ay; farewell. CLOWN Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping of wise people; for indeed there is no goodness in the worm.
