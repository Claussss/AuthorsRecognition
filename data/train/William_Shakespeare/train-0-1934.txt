No marvel, lord, though it affrighted you;
I am afraid, methinks, to hear you tell it. Ah, Brackenbury, I have done these things,
That now give evidence against my soul,
For Edwardâ€™s sake; and see how he requites me.
Keeper, I pray thee, sit by me awhile.
My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep. I will, my lord. God give your grace good rest.
