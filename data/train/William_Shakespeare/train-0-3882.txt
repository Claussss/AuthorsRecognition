Fare thee well, nymph. Ere he do leave this grove
Thou shalt fly him, and he shall seek thy love. Enter Robin Goodfellow the puck  Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer. Ay, there it is. OBERON I pray thee give it me. I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,
Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows, 250
Quite overcanopied with luscious woodbine,
With sweet musk-roses, and with eglantine.
There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,
Lulled in these flowers with dances and delight;
And there the snake throws her enamelled skin,
Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in;
And with the juice of this Iâ€™ll streak her eyes,
And make her full of hateful fantasies.
Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove.
A sweet Athenian lady is in love 260
With a disdainful youth. Anoint his eyes;
But do it when the next thing he espies
May be the lady. Thou shalt know the man
By the Athenian garments he hath on.
Effect it with some care, that he may prove
More fond on her than she upon her love;
And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.
