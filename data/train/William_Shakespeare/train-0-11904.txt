Enter the Lord Chamberlain LORD CHAMBERLAIN Mercy o’ me, what a multitude are here!
They grow still, too—from all parts they are coming,
As if we kept a fair here! Where are these porters,
These lazy knaves? (To the Porter and his man) You’ve
made a fine hand, fellows!
There’s a trim rabble let in—are all these
Your faithful friends o’th’ suburbs? We shall have
Great store of room, no doubt, left for the ladies
When they pass back from the christening!
