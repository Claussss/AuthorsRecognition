People of Rome, and people’s tribunes here,
I ask your voices and your suffrages.
Will ye bestow them friendly on Andronicus? To gratify the good Andronicus
And gratulate his safe return to Rome
The people will accept whom he admits. Tribunes, I thank you, and this suit I make:
That you create our emperor’s eldest son
Lord Saturnine, whose virtues will, I hope,
Reflect on Rome as Titan’s rays on earth,
And ripen justice in this commonweal.
Then if you will elect by my advice,
Crown him and say, ‘Long live our Emperor!’
