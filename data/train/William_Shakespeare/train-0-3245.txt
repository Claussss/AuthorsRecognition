COSTARD (as Pompey) I Pompey am— BIRON You lie, you are not he. COSTARD (as Pompey) I Pompey am— BOYET With leopard’s head on knee. Well said, old mocker. I must needs be friends with thee. COSTARD (as Pompey) I Pompey am, Pompey surnamed the Big. DUMAINE ‘The Great’. COSTARD It is ‘Great’, sir— (As Pompey) Pompey surnamed the Great,
That oft in field with targe and shield did make my
foe to sweat,
And travelling along this coast I here am come by
chance,
And lay my arms before the legs of this sweet lass of
France.—
If your ladyship would say ‘Thanks, Pompey’, I had
done.
