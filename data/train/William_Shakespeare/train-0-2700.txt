Retreat sounds within Retreat is soundedâ€”one side hath the worse.
O, if it be the French, sweet fortune turn,
And in thy turning, change the froward winds
That, with advantage of a favouring sky,
Our men may vanquish, and the other fly. Enter the French Mariner My heart misgives. (To the Mariner) Say, mirror of
pale death,
To whom belongs the honour of this day?
Relate, I pray thee, if thy breath will serve
The sad discourse of this discomfiture.
