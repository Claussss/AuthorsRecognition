Good morrow, Master Sheriffs of London, to ye both.
I thank ye that ye will vouchsafe to meet me.
I see by this you have not quite forgot
That I was in times past as you are now,
A sheriff of London. FIRST SHERIFF Sir, then you know our duty doth require it. I know it well, sir, else I would have been glad
You might have saved a labour at this time.
[To Second Sheriff] Ah, Master Sheriff,
You and I have been of old acquaintance.
You were a patient auditor of mine
When I read the divinity lecture
At St Laurenceâ€™s.
