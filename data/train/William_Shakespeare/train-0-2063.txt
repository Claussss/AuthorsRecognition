Which, since you come too late of our intent,
Yet witness what you hear we did intend,
And so, my good Lord Mayor, we bid farewell. RICHARD GLOUCESTER Go after; after, cousin Buckingham!
The Mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post;
There, at your meetest vantage of the time,
Infer the bastardy of Edward’s children.
Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen
Only for saying he would make his son
‘Heir to the Crown’—meaning indeed, his house,
Which by the sign thereof was termed so.
Moreover, urge his hateful luxury
And bestial appetite in change of lust,
Which stretched unto their servants, daughters, wives,
Even where his raging eye, or savage heart,
Without control, listed to make a prey.
Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:
Tell them, when that my mother went with child
Of that insatiate Edward, noble York,
My princely father, then had wars in France,
And by true computation of the time
Found that the issue was not his begot—
Which well appeared in his lineaments,
Being nothing like the noble Duke my father.
Yet touch this sparingly, as ’twere far off,
Because, my lord, you know my mother lives.
