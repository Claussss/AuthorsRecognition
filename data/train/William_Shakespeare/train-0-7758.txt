BOTH DAUGHTERS O happy alteration! Come then, subscribe, my lord. I am right glad of this your fair conversion. MORE O pardon me, I will subscribe to go unto the Tower
With all submissive willingness, and thereto add
My bones to strengthen the foundation
Of Julius Caesar’s palace. Now, my lord,
I’ll satisfy the King even with my blood.
Nor will I wrong your patience. [To Downes] Friend, do
thine office.
