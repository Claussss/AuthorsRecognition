FIRST CITIZEN Come, come, we fear the worst. All will be well. THIRD CITIZEN When clouds are seen, wise men put on their cloaks;
When great leaves fall, then winter is at hand;
When the sun sets, who doth not look for night?
Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.
All may be well, but if God sort it so
â€™Tis more than we deserve, or I expect.
