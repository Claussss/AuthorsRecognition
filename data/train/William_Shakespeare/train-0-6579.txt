QUEEN GERTRUDE Nay, then, Iâ€™ll set those to you that can speak. Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not budge.
You go not till I set you up a glass
Where you may see the inmost part of you. QUEEN GERTRUDE What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murder me?
Help, help, ho! POLONIUS (behind the arras) What ho! Help, help, help!
