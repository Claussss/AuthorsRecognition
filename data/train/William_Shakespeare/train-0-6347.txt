Are you his brother? Was’t you he rescued? Was’t you that did so oft contrive to kill him? ‘Twas I, but ’tis not I. I do not shame
To tell you what I was, since my conversion
So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am. But for the bloody napkin? OLIVER By and by. When from the first to last betwixt us two
Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed—
As how I came into that desert place—
I’ brief, he led me to the gentle Duke,
Who gave me fresh array, and entertainment,
Committing me unto my brother’s love,
Who led me instantly unto his cave,
There stripped himself, and here upon his arm
The lioness had torn some flesh away,
Which all this while had bled. And now he fainted,
And cried in fainting upon Rosalind.
Brief, I recovered him, bound up his wound,
And after some small space, being strong at heart,
He sent me hither, stranger as I am,
To tell this story, that you might excuse
His broken promise, and to give this napkin,
Dyed in his blood, unto the shepherd youth
That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.
