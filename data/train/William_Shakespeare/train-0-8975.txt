POET and PAINTER What we can do we’ll do to do you service. You’re honest men. You’ve heard that I have gold,
I am sure you have. Speak truth; you’re honest men. So it is said, my noble lord, but therefor
Came not my friend nor I. Good honest men. (To Painter) Thou draw‘st a
counterfeit
Best in all Athens; thou’rt indeed the best;
Thou counterfeit’st most lively.
