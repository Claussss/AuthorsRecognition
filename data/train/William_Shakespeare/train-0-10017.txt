Now to Marina bend your mind,
Whom our fast-growing scene must find
At Tarsus, and by Cleon trained
In music, letters; who hath gained
Of education all the grace,
Which makes her both the heart and place
Of gen‘ral wonder. But, alack,
That monster envy, oft the wrack
Of earned praise, Marina’s life
Seeks to take off by treason’s knife,
And in this kind our Cleon has
One daughter, and a full-grown lass
E’en ripe for marriage-rite. This maid
Hight Philoten, and it is said
For certain in our story she
Would ever with Marina be,
Be’t when they weaved the sleided silk
With fingers long, small, white as milk;
Or when she would with sharp nee‘le wound
The cambric which she made more sound
By hurting it, or when to th’ lute
She sung, and made the night bird mute,
That still records with moan; or when
She would with rich and constant pen
Vail to her mistress Dian. Still
This Philoten contends in skill
With absolute Marina; so
With dove of Paphos might the crow
Vie feathers white. Marina gets
All praises which are paid as debts,
And not as given. This so darks
In Philoten all graceful marks
That Cleon’s wife with envy rare
A present murder does prepare
For good Marina, that her daughter
Might stand peerless by this slaughter.
The sooner her vile thoughts to stead
Lychorida, our nurse, is dead,
A tomb is revealed
And cursed Dionyza hath
The pregnant instrument of wrath
Pressed for this blow. Th’unborn event
I do commend to your content,
Only I carry winged Time
Post on the lame feet of my rhyme,
Which never could I so convey
Unless your thoughts went on my way.
Enter Dionyza with Leonine
Dionyza does appear,
With Leonine, a murderer. Exit
