A beast, as thou art. The canker gnaw thy heart
For showing me again the eyes of man. What is thy name? Is man so hateful to thee
That art thyself a man? I am Misanthropos, and hate mankind.
For thy part, I do wish thou wert a dog,
That I might love thee something. ALCIBIADES I know thee well, But in thy fortunes am unlearned and strange.
