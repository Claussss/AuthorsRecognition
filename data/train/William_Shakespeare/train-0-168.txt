Thomas Freeman, Run and a Great Cast (1614) Inscriptions upon the Shakespeare monument, Stratford-upon-Avon Iudicio Pylium, genio Socratem, arte Maronem, Terra tegit, populus maeret, Olympus habet. Stay, passenger, why goest thou by so fast?
Read, if thou canst, whom envious death hath placed
Within this monument: Shakespeare, with whom
Quick nature died; whose name doth deck this tomb
Far more than cost, sith all that he hath writ
Leaves living art but page to serve his wit.
