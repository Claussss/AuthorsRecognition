Gloucester, whate’er we like, thou art Protector,
And lookest to command the Prince and realm.
Thy wife is proud: she holdeth thee in awe,
More than God or religious churchmen may. Name not religion, for thou lov‘st the flesh,
And ne’er throughout the year to church thou go’st,
Except it be to pray against thy foes.
