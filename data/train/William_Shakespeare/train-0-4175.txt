Well, see to live. I will not touch thine eye
For all the treasure that thine uncle owes.
Yet am I sworn, and I did purpose, boy,
With this same very iron to burn them out. O, now you look like Hubert. All this while
You were disguised. HUBERT Peace, no more. Adieu. Your uncle must not know but you are dead.
Iâ€™ll fill these dogged spies with false reports;
And, pretty child, sleep doubtless and secure
That Hubert, for the wealth of all the world,
Will not offend thee.
