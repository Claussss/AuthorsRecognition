EDMUND (to soldiers) Take them away. LEAR (to Cordelia) Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,
The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught
thee?
He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven
And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes.
The goodyear shall devour ‘em, flesh and fell,
Ere they shall make us weep. We’ll see ’em starve
first. Come.
