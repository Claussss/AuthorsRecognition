CLOWN BETTS Would I were so far on my journey. The first stretch is the worst, methinks. SHERIFF Bring Williamson there forward. Good Master Sheriff, I have an earnest suit,
And, as you are a man, denyâ€™t me not. Woman, what is it? Be it in my power,
Thou shalt obtain it. Let me die next, sir, that is all I crave.
You know not what a comfort you shall bring
To my poor heart to die before my husband.
