BAWD Thou mayst cut a morsel off the spit. BOULT I may so. BAWD Who should deny it? (To Marina) Come, young one, I like the manner of your garments well. BOULT Ay, by my faith, they shall not be changed yet. BAWD (giving him money) Boult, spend thou that in the town. Report what a sojourner we have. Youâ€™ll lose nothing by custom. When nature framed this piece she meant thee a good turn. Therefore say what a paragon she is, and thou reapest the harvest out of thine own setting forth.
