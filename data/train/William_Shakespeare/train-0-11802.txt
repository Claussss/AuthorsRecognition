The King that gave it. CARDINAL WOLSEY It must be himself then. Thou art a proud traitor, priest. CARDINAL WOLSEY Proud lord, thou liest. Within these forty hours Surrey durst better
Have burnt that tongue than said so. Thy ambition, Thou scarlet sin, robbed this bewailing land
Of noble Buckingham, my father-in-law.
The heads of all thy brother cardinals
With thee and all thy best parts bound together
Weighed not a hair of his. Plague of your policy,
You sent me deputy for Ireland,
Far from his succour, from the King, from all
That might have mercy on the fault thou gavâ€™st him;
Whilst your great goodness, out of holy pity,
Absolved him with an axe.
