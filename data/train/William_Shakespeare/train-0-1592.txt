Enter the Bishop of Winchester, now Cardinal RICHARD DUKE OF YORK (to Joan) Break thou in pieces, and consume to ashes,
Thou foul accursed minister of hell. Exit Joan, guarded Lord Regent, I do greet your excellence
With letters of commission from the King.
For know, my lords, the states of Christendom,
Moved with remorse of these outrageous broils,
Have earnestly implored a general peace
Betwixt our nation and the aspiring French,
And here at hand the Dauphin and his train
Approacheth to confer about some matter.
