My precious queen, forbear, And give true evidence to his love, which stands
An honourable trial. So Fulvia told me. I prithee turn aside and weep for her,
Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears
Belong to Egypt. Good now, play one scene
Of excellent dissembling, and let it look
Like perfect honour.
