Gualtier or Walterâ€”which it is I care not.
Never yet did base dishonour blur our name
But with our sword we wiped away the blot.
Therefore, when merchant-like I sell revenge,
Broke be my sword, my arms torn and defaced,
And I proclaimed a coward through the world. Stay, Whitmore; for thy prisoner is a prince,
The Duke of Suffolk, William de la Pole.
