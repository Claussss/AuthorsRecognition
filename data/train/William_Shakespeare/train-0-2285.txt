He kisses her; and she, by her good will,
Will never rise, so he will kiss her still. The night of sorrow now is turned to day.
Her two blue windows faintly she upheaveth,
Like the fair sun when, in his fresh array,
He cheers the morn, and all the earth relieveth; And as the bright sun glorifies the sky,
So is her face illumined with her eye,
