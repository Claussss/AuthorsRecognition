Were I chief lord of all this spacious world
I’d give it to undo the deed. A lady
Much less in blood than virtue, yet a princess
To equal any single crown o‘th’ earth
I’th’ justice of compare. O villain Leonine,
Whom thou hast poisoned too,
If thou hadst drunk to him ‘t’ad been a kindness
Becoming well thy fact. What canst thou say
When noble Pericles demands his child?
