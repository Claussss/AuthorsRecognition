Enter Corin and Silvius ROSALIND Ay, be so, good Touchstone. Look you, who comes here—a young man and an old in solemn talk. CORIN (to Silvius) That is the way to make her scorn you still. O Corin, that thou knew’st how I do love her! I partly guess; for I have loved ere now. No, Corin, being old thou canst not guess,
Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover
As ever sighed upon a midnight pillow.
But if thy love were ever like to mine—
As sure I think did never man love so—
How many actions most ridiculous
Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?
