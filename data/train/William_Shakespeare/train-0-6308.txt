Thou hast my love, is not that neighbourly? I would have you. PHOEBE Why, that were covetousness. Silvius, the time was that I hated thee;
And yet it is not that I bear thee love.
But since that thou canst talk of love so well,
Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,
I will endure; and Iâ€™ll employ thee, too.
But do not look for further recompense
Than thine own gladness that thou art employed.
