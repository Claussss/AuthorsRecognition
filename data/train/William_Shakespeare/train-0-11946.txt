Are you not out? Meet you no ruin but the soldier in
The cranks and turns of Thebes? You did begin
As if you met decays of many kinds.
Perceive you none that do arouse your pity
But th’unconsidered soldier? Yes, I pity Decays where’er I find them, but such most
That, sweating in an honourable toil,
Are paid with ice to cool ’em.
