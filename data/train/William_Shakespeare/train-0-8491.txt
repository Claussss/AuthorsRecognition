OSWALD He’s coming, madam. I hear him. Put on what weary negligence you please,
You and your fellow servants. I’d have it come in
question.
If he dislike it, let him to our sister,
Whose mind and mine I know in that are one,
Not to be overruled. Idle old man,
That still would manage those authorities
That he hath given away! Now, by my life,
Old fools are babes again, and must be used
With checks as flatteries, when they are seen abused.
Remember what I tell you.
