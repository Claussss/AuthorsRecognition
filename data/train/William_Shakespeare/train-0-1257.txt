Enter a Post WARWICK What news, my friend? That Edward is escaped from your brother
And fled, as he hears since, to Burgundy. WARWICK
Unsavoury news—but how made he escape ? He was conveyed by Richard Duke of Gloucester
And the Lord Hastings, who attended him
In secret ambush on the forest side
And from the Bishop’s huntsmen rescued him—
For hunting was his daily exercise.
