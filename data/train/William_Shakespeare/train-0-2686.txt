Which now lies fast asleep within my heart.
When they are gone, then I’ll consent to love.
Stir not, lascivious King, to hinder me.
My resolution is more nimbler far
Than thy prevention can be in my rescue.
An if thou stir, I strike. Therefore stand still,
And hear the choice that I will put thee to.
Either swear to leave thy most unholy suit
And never henceforth to solicit me,
Or else, by heaven, this sharp-pointed knife
Shall stain thy earth with that which thou wouldst stain—
My poor, chaste blood. Swear, Edward, swear,
Or I will strike and die before thee here.
