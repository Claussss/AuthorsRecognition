Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends
They have chose a consul that will from them take
Their liberties, make them of no more voice
Than dogs that are as often beat for barking,
As therefor kept to do so. SICINIUS (to the Citizens) Let them assemble, And on a safer judgement all revoke
Your ignorant election. Enforce his pride
And his old hate unto you. Besides, forget not
With what contempt he wore the humble weed,
How in his suit he scorned you; but your loves,
Thinking upon his services, took from you
Thâ€™apprehension of his present portance,
Which most gibingly, ungravely he did fashion
After the inveterate hate he bears you.
