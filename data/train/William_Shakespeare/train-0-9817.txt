Enter a Gentleman Austringer In happy time!
This man may help me to his majesty’s ear,
If he would spend his power.—God save you, sir. GENTLEMAN And you. Sir, I have seen you in the court of France. GENTLEMAN I have been sometimes there. I do presume, sir, that you are not fall’n
From the report that goes upon your goodness,
And therefore, goaded with most sharp occasions
Which lay nice manners by, I put you to
The use of your own virtues, for the which
I shall continue thankful.
