Good father, tell her that she and my aunt Percy
Shall follow in your conduct speedily. She is desperate here, a peevish self-willed harlotry,
One that no persuasion can do good upon. 195 The lady speaks in Welsh I understand thy looks. That pretty Welsh
Which thou down pourest from these swelling
heavens
I am too perfect in, and but for shame
In such a parley should I answer thee.
