Enter a Messenger O my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall’s dead,
Slain by his servant going to put out
The other eye of Gloucester. Gloucester’s eyes? A servant that he bred, thrilled with remorse,
Opposed against the act, bending his sword
To his great master, who thereat enraged
Flew on him, and amongst them felled him dead,
But not without that harmful stroke which since
Hath plucked him after.
