Jesus preserve your royal majesty. What sayst thou? ‘Majesty’ ? I am but ‘grace’. But by the grace of God and Hume’s advice
Your grace’s title shall be multiplied. What sayst thou, man? Hast thou as yet conferred
With Margery Jordan, the cunning witch of Eye,
With Roger Bolingbroke, the conjuror?
And will they undertake to do me good?
