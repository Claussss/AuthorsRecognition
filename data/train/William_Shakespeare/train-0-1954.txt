FIRST MURDERER Why, so he doth, when he delivers you
From this earth’s thraldom to the joys of heaven. SECOND MURDERER Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord. Have you that holy feeling in your souls
To counsel me to make my peace with God,
And are you yet to your own souls so blind
That you will war with God by murd’ring me?
O sirs, consider: they that set you on
To do this deed will hate you for the deed.
