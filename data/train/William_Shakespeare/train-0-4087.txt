Enter at another doorthe English Herald, with a trumpeter ENGLISH HERALD Rejoice, you men of Angers, ring your bells!
King John, your king and England’s, doth approach,
Commander of this hot malicious day.
Their armours that marched hence so silver-bright 315
Hither return all gilt with Frenchmen’s blood.
There stuck no plume in any English crest
That is removed by a staff of France;
Our colours do return in those same hands
That did display them when we first marched forth;
And like a jolly troop of huntsmen come 321
Our lusty English, all with purpled hands
Dyed in the dying slaughter of their foes.
Open your gates and give the victors way.
