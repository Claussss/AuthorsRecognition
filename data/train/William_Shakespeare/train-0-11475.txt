You cram these words into mine ears against
The stomach of my sense. Would I had never
Married my daughter there! For, coming thence,
My son is lost; and, in my rate, she too,
Who is so far from Italy removed
I neâ€™er again shall see her. O thou mine heir
Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
Hath made his meal on thee?
