Thus, hoping that Adonis is alive,
Her rash suspect she doth extenuate,
And, that his beauty may the better thrive,
With death she humbly doth insinuate; Tells him of trophies, statues, tombs; and stories
His victories, his triumphs, and his glories. ‘O Jove,’ quoth she, ‘how much a fool was I
To be of such a weak and silly mind
To wail his death who lives, and must not die
Till mutual overthrow of mortal kind!
