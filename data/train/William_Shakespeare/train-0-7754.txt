Good morrow, good Sir Thomas. SURREY [to Lady More] Good day, good madam. Kind salutations Welcome, my good lords. What ails your lordships look so melancholy?
O, I know: you live in court, and the court diet
Is only friend to physic. O Sir Thomas, Our words are now the King‘s, and our sad looks
The interest of your love. We are sent to you
From our mild sovereign once more to demand
If you’ll subscribe unto those articles
He sent ye th’other day. Be well advised,
For, on my honour, lord, grave Doctor Fisher,
Bishop of Rochester, at the self-same instant
Attached with you, is sent unto the Tower
For the like obstinacy. His majesty
Hath only sent you prisoner to your house,
But, if you now refuse for to subscribe,
A stricter course will follow.
