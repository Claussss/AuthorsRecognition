King Lear is [discovered] asleep O my dear father, restoration hang
Thy medicine on my lips, and let this kiss
Repair those violent harms that my two sisters
Have in thy reverence made! KENT Kind and dear princess! Had you not been their father, these white flakes
Had challenged pity of them. Was this a face
To be exposed against the warring winds,
To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder
In the most terrible and nimble stroke
Of quick cross-lightning, to watch—poor perdu—
With this thin helm? Mine injurer’s mean‘st dog,
Though he had bit me, should have stood that night
Against my fire. And wast thou fain, poor father,
To hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn
In short and musty straw? Alack, alack,
’Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once
Had not concluded all! (To the Doctor) He wakes.
Speak to him.
