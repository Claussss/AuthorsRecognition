Ay, my good lord, I know the gentleman
To be of worth, and worthy estimation,
And not without desert so well reputed. DUKE Hath he not a son? Ay, my good lord, a son that well deserves
The honour and regard of such a father. DUKE You know him well? I knew him as myself, for from our infancy
We have conversed, and spent our hours together.
And though myself have been an idle truant,
Omitting the sweet benefit of time
To clothe mine age with angel-like perfection,
Yet hath Sir Proteus—for that’s his name—
Made use and fair advantage of his days:
His years but young, but his experience old;
His head unmellowed, but his judgement ripe.
And in a word—for far behind his worth
Comes all the praises that I now bestow—
He is complete, in feature and in mind,
With all good grace to grace a gentleman.
