JAMY I say gud day, Captain Fluellen. FLUELLEN Good e’en to your worship, good Captain James. GOWER How now, Captain MacMorris, have you quit the mines? Have the pioneers given o’er? MACMORRIS By Chrish law, ‘tish ill done. The work ish give over, the trumpet sound the retreat. By my hand I swear, and my father’s soul, the work ish ill done, it ish give over. I would have blowed up the town, so Chrish save me law, in an hour. O ’tish ill done, ‘tish ill done, by my hand ’tish ill done.
