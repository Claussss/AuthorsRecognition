REYNALDO As gaming, my lord? Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing,
Quarrelling, drabbing—you may go so far. My lord, that would dishonour him. Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.
You must not put another scandal on him,
That he is open to incontinency.
That’s not my meaning—but breathe his faults so
quaintly
That they may seem the taints of liberty,
The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
Of general assault.
