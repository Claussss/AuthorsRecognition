STANLEY (to Anne) Come, madam, come. I in all haste was sent. And I in all unwillingness will go.
O would to God that the inclusive verge
Of golden metal that must round my brow
Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brains.
Anointed let me be with deadly venom,
And die ere men can say ‘God save the Queen’.
