LADY MACBETH Help me hence, ho! Look to the lady. MALCOLM (aside to Donalbain) Why do we hold our tongues,
That most may claim this argument for ours? DONALBAIN (aside to Malcolm) What should be spoken here, where our fate,
Hid in an auger-hole, may rush and seize us?
Letâ€™s away. Our tears are not yet brewed.
