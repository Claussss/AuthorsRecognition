FIRST GENTLEMAN The heavens Through you increase our wonder, and set up
Your fame for ever. CERIMON She is alive. Behold, Her eyelids, cases to those heav’nly jewels
Which Pericles hath lost,
Begin to part their fringes of bright gold.
The diamonds of a most praised water
Doth appear to make the world twice rich.—Live,
And make us weep to hear your fate, fair creature,
Rare as you seem to be.
