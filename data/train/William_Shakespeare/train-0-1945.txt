SECOND MURDERER You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon. In God’s name, what art thou? FIRST MURDERER A man, as you are. CLARENCE But not as I am, royal. FIRST MURDERER Nor you as we are, loyal. Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble. FIRST MURDERER My voice is now the King’s; my looks, mine own.
