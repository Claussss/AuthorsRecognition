PRINCE OF WALES Renowned Audley, live, and have from me
This gift twice doubled to these squires and thee.
But live or die, what thou hast given away
To these and theirs shall lasting freedom stay.
(To the Squires) Come, gentlemen, I’ll see my friend bestowed
Within an easy litter. Then we’ll march
Proudly toward Calais with triumphant pace,
Unto my royal father, and there bring
The tribute of my wars: fair France his king.
