Ah, hark—the fatal followers do pursue,
And I am faint and cannot fly their fury;
And were I strong, I would not shun their fury.
The sands are numbered that makes up my life.
Here must I stay, and here my life must end.
Enter Queen Margaret, Lord Clifford, the Earl of
Northumberland, and the young Prince Edward,
with soldiers
Come bloody Clifford, rough Northumberland—
I dare your quenchless fury to more rage!
I am your butt, and I abide your shot.
