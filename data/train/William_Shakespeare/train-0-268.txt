VALENTINE Yourself, sweet lady, for you gave the fire. Sir Thurio borrows his wit from your ladyshipâ€™s looks, and spends what he borrows kindly in your company. THURIO Sir, if you spend word for word with me, I shall make your wit bankrupt. VALENTINE I know it well, sir. You have an exchequer of words, and, I think, no other treasure to give your followers. For it appears by their bare liveries that they live by your bare words.
