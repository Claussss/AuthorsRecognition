York set him on; York should have sent him aid. And York as fast upon your grace exclaims,
Swearing that you withhold his levied horse
Collected for this expedition. York lies. He might have sent and had the horse.
I owe him little duty and less love,
And take foul scorn to fawn on him by sending. The fraud of England, not the force of France,
Hath now entrapped the noble-minded Talbot.
Never to England shall he bear his life,
But dies betrayed to fortune by your strife.
