NORTHUMBERLAND Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,
Bloody with spurring, fiery red with haste. BOLINGBROKE Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues
A banished traitor. All my treasury
Is yet but unfelt thanks, which, more enriched,
Shall be your love and labourâ€™s recompense. Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord.
