BOLINGBROKE So that by this intelligence we learn
The Welshmen are dispersed, and Salisbury
Is gone to meet the King, who lately landed
With some few private friends upon this coast. NORTHUMBERLAND The news is very fair and good, my lord.
Richard not far from hence hath hid his head. It would beseem the Lord Northumberland
To say ‘King Richard’. Alack the heavy day
When such a sacred king should hide his head!
