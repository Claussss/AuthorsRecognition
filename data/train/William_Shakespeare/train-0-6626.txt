KING CLAUDIUS Who shall stay you? LAERTES My will, not all the world; And for my means, I’ll husband them so well
They shall go far with little. KING CLAUDIUS Good Laertes, If you desire to know the certainty
Of your dear father’s death, is’t writ in your revenge
That, sweepstake, you will draw both friend and foe,
Winner and loser?
