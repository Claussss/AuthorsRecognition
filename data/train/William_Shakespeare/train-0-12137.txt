Enter the Doctor, the jailer, and the Wooer in the habit of Palamon 
DOCTOR Has this advice I told you done any good upon her? WOOER O, very much. The maids that kept her company have half persuaded her that I am Palamon. Within this half-hour she came smiling to me, and asked me what I would eat, and when I would kiss her. I told her presently, and kissed her twice.
