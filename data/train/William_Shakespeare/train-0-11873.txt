Now by thy looks I guess thy message. Is the Queen delivered? Say, ‘Ay, and of a boy.’ Ay, ay, my liege, And of a lovely boy. The God of heaven
Both now and ever bless her! ’Tis a girl
Promises boys hereafter. Sir, your queen
Desires your visitation, and to be
Acquainted with this stranger. ’Tis as like you
As cherry is to cherry.
