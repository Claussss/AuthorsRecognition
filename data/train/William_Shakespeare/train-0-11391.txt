POSTHUMUS (raising him) Kneel not to me. The power that I have on you is to spare you,
The malice towards you to forgive you. Live,
And deal with others better. Nobly doomed! We’ll learn our freeness of a son-in-law.
Pardon’s the word to all. ARVIRAGUS (to Posthumus) You holp us, sir, As you did mean indeed to be our brother.
Joyed are we that you are.
