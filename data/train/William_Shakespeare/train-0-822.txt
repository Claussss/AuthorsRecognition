Must you, Sir John, protect my lady here? So am I given in charge, mayâ€™t please your grace. Entreat her not the worse in that I pray
You use her well. The world may laugh again,
And I may live to do you kindness if
You do it her. And so, Sir John, farewell. 85
Gloucester begins to leave What, gone, my lord, and bid me not farewell?
