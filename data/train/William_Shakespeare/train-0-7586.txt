But if the English blood be once but up,
As I perceive their hearts already full,
I fear me much, before their spleens be cooled,
Some of these saucy aliens for their pride 60
Will pay for’t soundly, wheresoe’er it lights.
This tide of rage that with the eddy strives,
I fear me much, will drown too many lives.
