I shall serve you, sir, Truly, however else. GLOUCESTER (to Cornwall) For him I thank your grace. You know not why we came to visit you— Thus out of season, threading dark-eyed night—
Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,
Wherein we must have use of your advice.
Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,
Of differences which I least thought it fit
To answer from our home. The several messengers
From hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,
Lay comforts to your bosom, and bestow
Your needful counsel to our businesses,
Which craves the instant use.
