FLAVIUS My dear lord— TIMON What if it should be so? FLAVIUS My lord— I’ll have it so. My steward! FLAVIUS Here, my lord. So fitly? Go bid all my friends again:
Lucius, Lucullus, and Sempronius—all luxors, all.
I’ll once more feast the rascals. FLAVIUS O my lord, You only speak from your distracted soul.
There is not so much left to furnish out
A moderate table.
