CAPULET’S WIFE A crutch, a crutch—why call you for a sword? Enter Montague  My sword, I say. Old Montague is come,
And flourishes his blade in spite of me. Thou villain Capulet! Hold me not, let me go. MONTAGUE’S WIFE Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe. Enter Prince Escalus with his train Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
Profaners of this neighbour-stained steet—
Will they not hear? What ho, you men, you beasts,
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
With purple fountains issuing from your veins:
On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground,
And hear the sentence of your moved Prince.
