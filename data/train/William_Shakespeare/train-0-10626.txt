O Lady Fortune, Stand you auspicious! See, your guests approach. Address yourself to entertain them sprightly,
And let’s be red with mirth. Enter the Old Shepherd, with Polixenes and Camillo,
disguised, the Clown, Mopsa, Dorcas, and others OLD SHEPHERD (to Perdita) Fie, daughter, when my old wife lived, upon
This day she was both pantler, butler, cook,
Both dame and servant, welcomed all, served all,
Would sing her song and dance her turn, now here
At upper end o‘th’ table, now i’th’ middle,
On his shoulder, and his, her face afire
With labour, and the thing she took to quench it
She would to each one sip. You are retired
As if you were a feasted one and not
The hostess of the meeting. Pray you bid
These unknown friends to’s welcome, for it is
A way to make us better friends, more known.
Come, quench your blushes, and present yourself
That which you are, mistress o’th’ feast. Come on,
And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,
As your good flock shall prosper.
