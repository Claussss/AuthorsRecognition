ARCHIDAMUS Would they else be content to die? CAMILLO Yes—if there were no other excuse why they should desire to live. ARCHIDAMUS If the King had no son they would desire to live on crutches till he had one. Exeunt 1.2
Enter Leontes, Hermione, Mamillius, Polixenes, and Camillo Nine changes of the wat‘ry star hath been
The shepherd’s note since we have left our throne
Without a burden. Time as long again
Would be filled up, my brother, with our thanks,
And yet we should for perpetuity
Go hence in debt. And therefore, like a cipher,
Yet standing in rich place, I multiply
With one ‘We thank you’ many thousands more
That go before it.
