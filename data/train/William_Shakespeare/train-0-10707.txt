You are one of those Would have him wed again. If you would not so You pity not the state, nor the remembrance
Of his most sovereign name, consider little
What dangers, by his highness’ fail of issue,
May drop upon his kingdom and devour
Incertain lookers-on. What were more holy
Than to rejoice the former queen is well?
What holier, than for royalty’s repair,
For present comfort and for future good,
To bless the bed of majesty again
With a sweet fellow to’t?
