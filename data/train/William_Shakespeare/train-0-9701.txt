Flourish. Exeunt 3.2
Enter the Countess with a letter, and Lavatch COUNTESS It hath happened all as I would have had it, save that he comes not along with her. LAVATCH By my troth, I take my young lord to be a very melancholy man. COUNTESS By what observance, I pray you? LAVATCH Why, he will look upon his boot and sing, mend the ruff and sing, ask questions and sing, pick his teeth and sing. I know a man that had this trick of melancholy sold a goodly manor for a song.
