Like a milch doe whose swelling dugs do ache,
Hasting to feed her fawn hid in some brake. By this she hears the hounds are at a bay,
Whereat she starts, like one that spies an adder
Wreathed up in fatal folds just in his way,
The fear whereof doth make him shake and shudder; Even so the timorous yelping of the hounds
Appals her senses, and her spirit confounds.
