Thou hast, Ventidius, that Without the which a soldier and his sword
Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony? I’ll humbly signify what in his name,
That magical word of war, we have effected;
How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,
The ne‘er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia
We have jaded out o’th’ field.
