O, Publius, is not this a heavy case,
To see thy noble uncle thus distraught? Therefore, my lords, it highly us concerns
By day and night tâ€™attend him carefully
And feed his humour kindly as we may,
Till time beget some careful remedy. Kinsmen, his sorrows are past remedy,
But 
Join with the Goths, and with revengeful war
Take wreak on Rome for this ingratitude,
And vengeance on the traitor Saturnine.
