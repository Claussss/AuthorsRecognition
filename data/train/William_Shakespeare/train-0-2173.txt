SHERIFF It is. Why then All-Souls’ day is my body’s doomsday.
This is the day which, in King Edward’s time,
I wished might fall on me, when I was found
False to his children and his wife’s allies.
This is the day wherein I wished to fall
By the false faith of him whom most I trusted.
This, this All-Souls’ day to my fearful soul
Is the determined respite of my wrongs.
That high all-seer which I dallied with
Hath turned my feigned prayer on my head,
And given in earnest what I begged in jest.
Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men
To turn their own points in their masters’ bosoms.
Thus Margaret’s curse falls heavy on my neck.
‘When he’, quoth she, ‘shall split thy heart with sorrow,
Remember Margaret was a prophetess.’
Come lead me, officers, to the block of shame.
Wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame.
