Lucina lent not me her aid,
But took me in my throes,
That from me was Posthumus ripped,
Came crying ’mongst his foes,
A thing of pity. Great nature like his ancestry
Moulded the stuff so fair
That he deserved the praise o’th’ world
As great Sicilius’ heir. FIRST BROTHER When once he was mature for man,
In Britain where was he
That could stand up his parallel,
Or fruitful object be
In eye of Innogen, that best
Could deem his dignity?
