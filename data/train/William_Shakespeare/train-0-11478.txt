So is the dear‘st o’th’ loss. GONZALO My lord Sebastian, The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness
And time to speak it in. You rub the sore
When you should bring the plaster. SEBASTIAN (to Antonio) Very well. ANTONIO And most chirurgeonly. GONZALO (to Alonso) It is foul weather in us all, good sir,
When you are cloudy.
