Enter Pindarus Fly further off, my lord, fly further off!
Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord;
Fly therefore, noble Cassius, fly farre off. This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius,
Are those my tents where I perceive the fire? They are, my lord. CASSIUS Titinius, if thou lovest me, Mount thou my horse, and hide thy spurs in him
Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops
And here again, that I may rest assured
Whether yon troops are friend or enemy.
