Exit, [carried in the chair] KING RICHARD And let them die that age and sullens have,
For both hast thou, and both become the grave. I do beseech your majesty impute his words
To wayward sickliness and age in him.
He loves you, on my life, and holds you dear
As Harry Duke of Hereford, were he here. KING RICHARD
