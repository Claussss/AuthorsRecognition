LEONINE When was this? MARINA When I was born. Never was waves nor wind more violent.
Once from the ladder tackle washes off
A canvas-climber. ‘Ha!’ says one, ‘wolt out?’
And with a dropping industry they skip
From stem to stern. The boatswain whistles, and
The master calls and trebles their confusion.
