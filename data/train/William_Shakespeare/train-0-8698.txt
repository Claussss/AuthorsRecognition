What, I will be jovial. Come, come,
I am a king, my masters, know you that? You are a royal one, and we obey you. LEAR Then there’s life in’t. Nay, an you get it, you shall get it with running. Exit running, pursued by two Gentlemen A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,

Who redeems nature from the general curse
Which twain hath brought her to.
