FESTE Will you make me believe that I am not sent for you? Go to, go to, thou art a foolish fellow,
Let me be clear of thee. FESTE Well held out, iâ€™faith! No, I do not know you, nor I am not sent to you by my lady to bid you come speak with her, nor your name is not Master Cesario, nor this is not my nose, neither. Nothing that is so, is so.
