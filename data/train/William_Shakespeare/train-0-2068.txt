RICHARD GLOUCESTER What tongueless blocks were they! Would they not speak? RICHARD GLOUCESTER Will not the Mayor then, and his brethren, come? The Mayor is here at hand. Intend some fear;
Be not you spoke with, but by mighty suit;
And look you get a prayer book in your hand,
And stand between two churchmen, good my lord,
For on that ground I’ll build a holy descant.
And be not easily won to our request.
Play the maid’s part: still answer ‘nay’—and take it.
