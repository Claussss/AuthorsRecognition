Old lord, I cannot blame thee, Who am myself attached with weariness
To thâ€™ dulling of my spirits. Sit down and rest.
Even here I will put off my hope, and keep it
No longer for my flatterer. He is drowned
Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks
Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go. ANTONIO (aside to Sebastian)
