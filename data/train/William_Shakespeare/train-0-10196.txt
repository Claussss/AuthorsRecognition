AUFIDIUS We hate alike. Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor
More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot. Let the first budger die the other’s slave,
And the gods doom him after. If I fly, Martius, Holla me like a hare. MARTIUS Within these three hours, Tullus, Alone I fought in your Corioles’ walls,
And made what work I pleased. ’Tis not my blood
Wherein thou seest me masked. For thy revenge,
Wrench up thy power to th’ highest.
