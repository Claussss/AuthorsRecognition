Sound trumpets, and set forward combatants! A charge is sounded. King Richard throws down his warder Stay, the King hath thrown his warder down. KING RICHARD Let them lay by their helmets and their spears,
And both return back to their chairs again. Bolingbroke and Mowbray disarm and sit (To the nobles) Withdraw with us, and let the trumpets sound
While we return these dukes what we decree.
