Madam, I go with all convenient speed. Exit Come on, Nerissa. I have work in hand
That you yet know not of. We’ll see our husbands
Before they think of us. NERISSA Shall they see us? They shall, Nerissa, but in such a habit
That they shall think we are accomplish
With that we lack. I’ll hold thee any wager,
When we are both accoutered like young men
I’ll prove the prettier fellow of the two,
And wear my dagger with the braver grace,
And speak between the change of man and boy
With a reed voice, and turn two mincing steps
Into a manly stride, and speak of frays
Like a fine bragging youth, and tell quaint lies
How honourable ladies sought my love,
Which I denying, they fell sick and died.
I could not do withal. Then I’ll repent,
And wish for all that that I had not killed them;
And twenty of these puny lies I’ll tell,
That men shall swear I have discontinued school
Above a twelvemonth. I have within my mind
A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks
Which I will practise.
NERISSA Why, shall we turn to men?
