His majesty hath honoured much the city
In this his princely choice. MORE My lord and brethren, Though I depart for court, my love shall rest I now must sleep in court, sound sleeps forbear.
The chamberlain to state is public care.
Yet in this rising of my private blood
My studious thoughts shall tend the cityâ€™s good.
