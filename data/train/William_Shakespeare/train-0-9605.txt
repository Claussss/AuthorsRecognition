COUNTESS Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouthed and calumnious knave? LAVATCH A prophet? Ay, madam, and I speak the truth the next way. [He sings]
For I the ballad will repeat,
 Which men full true shall find:
 Your marriage comes by destiny,
 Your cuckoo sings by kind. COUNTESS Get you gone, sir. Iâ€™ll talk with you more anon.
