That Doctor Beal may chance beshrew himself
For reading of the bill. Let us go gather forces to the Mayor
For quick suppressing this rebellious rout. Now I bethink myself of Master More,
One of the sheriffs, a wise and learned gentleman,
And in especial favour with the people.
He, backed with other grave and sober men,
May by his gentle and persuasive speech
Perhaps prevail more than we can with power.
