Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench!
I love her ten times more than e’er I did.
O, how I long to have some chat with her! BAPTISTA (to Hortensio) Well, go with me, and be not so discomfited.
Proceed in practice with my younger daughter.
She’s apt to learn, and thankful for good turns.
Signor Petruccio, will you go with us,
Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you ?
