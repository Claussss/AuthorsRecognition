But what says Jupiter, I ask thee? CLOWN Alas, sir, I know not ‘Jupiter’. I never drank with him in all my life. Why, villain, art not thou the carrier? CLOWN Ay, of my pigeons, sir; nothing else. TITUS Why, didst thou not come from heaven? CLOWN From heaven? Alas, sir, I never came there. God forbid I should be so bold to press to heaven in my young days. Why, I am going with my pigeons to the tribunal plebs to take up a matter of brawl betwixt my uncle and one of the Emperal’s men.
