KING (to Diana) Methought you said You saw one here in court could witness it. I did, my lord, but loath am to produce
So bad an instrument. His name’s Paroles. I saw the man today, if man he be. Find him and bring him hither. Exit one What of him? He’s quoted for a most perfidious slave
With all the spots o’th’ world taxed and debauched,
Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth.
Am I or that or this for what he’ll utter,
That will speak anything?
