Preposterous ass, that never read so far
To know the cause why music was ordained!
Was it not to refresh the mind of man
After his studies or his usual pain?
Then give me leave to read philosophy,
And while I pause, serve in your harmony. Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine. Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong
To strive for that which resteth in my choice.
I am no breeching scholar in the schools.
I’ll not be tied to hours nor ‘pointed times,
But learn my lessons as I please myself;
And to cut off all strife, here sit we down.
(To Hortensio) Take you your instrument, play you the
whiles.
His lecture will be done ere you have tuned.
