My lord, I claim the gift, my due by promise,
For which your honour and your faith is pawned:
Thâ€™earldom of Hereford, and the movables
Which you have promised I shall possess. KING RICHARD Stanley, look to your wife. If she convey
Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it. What says your highness to my just request?
