And all those sayings will I overswear,
And all those swearings keep as true in soul
As doth that orbed continent the fire
That severs day from night. ORSINO Give me thy hand, And let me see thee in thy woman’s weeds. The captain that did bring me first on shore
Hath my maid’s garments. He upon some action
Is now in durance, at Malvolio’s suit,
A gentleman and follower of my lady’s.
