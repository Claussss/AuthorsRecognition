Your hostages I have, so have you mine,
And we shall talk before we fight. That first we come to words, and therefore have we
Our written purposes before us sent,
Which if thou hast considered, let us know
If â€™twill tie up thy discontented sword
And carry back to Sicily much tall youth
That else must perish here.
