COUNTESS OF SALISBURY Far from this place let ugly treason lie. KING EDWARD (aside) No farther off than her conspiring eye,
Which shoots infected poison in my heart
Beyond repulse of wit or cure of art.
Now in the sun alone it doth not lie
With light to take light from a mortal eye;
For here two day-stars that mine eyes would see
More than the sun steals mine own light from me.
Contemplative desire, desire to be
In contemplation that may master thee.
(Aloud) Warwick, Artois, to horse and letâ€™s away!
