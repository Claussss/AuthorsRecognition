Exit Steward Enter Helen COUNTESS (aside) Even so it was with me when I was young.
If ever we are nature’s, these are ours: this thorn
Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong.
Our blood to us, this to our blood is born;
It is the show and seal of nature’s truth,
Where love’s strong passion is impressed in youth.
By our remembrances of days foregone,
Such were our faults—or then we thought them
none.
Her eye is sick on’t. I observe her now.
