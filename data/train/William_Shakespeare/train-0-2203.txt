KING RICHARD The sun will not be seen today. The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.
I would these dewy tears were from the ground.
Not shine todayâ€”why, what is that to me
More than to Richmond? For the selfsame heaven
That frowns on me looks sadly upon him. Enter the Duke of Norfolk Arm, arm, my lord! The foe vaunts in the field.
