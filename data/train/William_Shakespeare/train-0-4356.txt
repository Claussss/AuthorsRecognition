This first of gold, who this inscription bears:
‘Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.’
The second silver, which this promise carries:
‘Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.’
This third dull lead, with warning all as blunt:
‘Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.’
How shall I know if I do choose the right?
