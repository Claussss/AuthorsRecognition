I care not, I, knew she and all the world,
I love Lavinia more than all the world. Youngling, learn thou to make some meaner choice.
Lavinia is thine elder brotherâ€™s hope. Why, are ye mad? Or know ye not in Rome
How furious and impatient they be,
And cannot brook competitors in love?
I tell you, lords, you do but plot your deaths
By this device.
