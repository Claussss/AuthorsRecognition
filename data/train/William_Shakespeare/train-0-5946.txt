Enter Lucius, with a letter The taper burneth in your closet, sir.
Searching the window for a flint, I found
This paper, thus sealed up, and I am sure
It did not lie there when I went to bed. He gives him the letter Get you to bed again; it is not day.
Is not tomorrow, boy, the ides of March? LUCIUS I know not, sir.
