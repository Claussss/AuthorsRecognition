Ay, noble father, if our words will serve. And if words will not, then our weapons shall. Why, what a brood of traitors have we here! Look in a glass, and call thy image so.
I am thy king, and thou a false-heart traitor.
Call hither to the stake my two brave bears,
That with the very shaking of their chains,
They may astonish these fell-lurking curs.
(To an attendant)
Bid Salisbury and Warwick come to me.
