An untimely ague Stayed me a prisoner in my chamber when 5
Those suns of glory, those two lights of men,
Met in the vale of Ardres. â€™Twixt Guisnes and Ardres. I was then present, saw them salute on horseback,
Beheld them when they lighted, how they clung
In their embracement as they grew together,
Which had they, what four throned ones could have
weighed
Such a compounded one?
