DEMETRIUS (to Tamora) Listen, fair madam, let it be your glory
To see her tears, but be your heart to them
As unrelenting flint to drops of rain. When did the tiger’s young ones teach the dam?
O, do not learn her wrath! She taught it thee.
The milk thou sucked’st from her did turn to marble,
Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny.
Yet every mother breeds not sons alike.
(To Chiron) Do thou entreat her show a woman’s pity.
