No quarrel, but a slight contention. YORK About what? About that which concerns your grace and us—
The crown of England, father, which is yours. Mine, boy? Not till King Henry be dead. Your right depends not on his life or death. Now you are heir—therefore enjoy it now.
By giving the house of Lancaster leave to breathe,
It will outrun you, father, in the end.
