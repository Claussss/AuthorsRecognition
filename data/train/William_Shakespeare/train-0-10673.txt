Then list to me. This follows, if you will not change your purpose
But undergo this flight: make for Sicilia,
And there present yourself and your fair princess,
For so I see she must be, fore Leontes.
She shall be habited as it becomes
The partner of your bed. Methinks I see
Leontes opening his free arms and weeping
His welcomes forth; asks thee there ‘Son, forgiveness!’
As ‘twere i’th’ father’s person, kisses the hands
Of your fresh princess; o‘er and o’er divides him
‘Twixt his unkindness and his kindness. Th’one
He chides to hell, and bids the other grow
Faster than thought or time.
