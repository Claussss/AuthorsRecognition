OPHELIA Still better, and worse. HAMLET So you mis-take your husbands. (To Lucianus) Begin, murderer. Pox, leave thy damnable faces and begin. Come: ‘the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge’. PLAYER LUCIANUS Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time

Thou mixture rank of midnight weeds collected,
With Hecate’s ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
Thy natural magic and dire property
On wholesome life usurp immediately.
