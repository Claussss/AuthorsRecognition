No, no, cousin,
 I will no more be hidden, nor put off
This great adventure to a second trial.
I know your cunning and I know your cause—
He that faints now, shame take him! Put thyself
Upon thy present guard— You are not mad? Or I will make th’advantage of this hour
Mine own, and what to come shall threaten me
I fear less than my fortune. Know, weak cousin,
I love Emilia, and in that I’ll bury
Thee and all crosses else.
