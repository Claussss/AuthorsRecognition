RICHARD GLOUCESTER These eyes could not endure sweet beauty’s wreck.
You should not blemish it if I stood by. As all the world is cheered by the sun,
So I by that: it is my day, my life. Black night o’ershade thy day, and death thy life. RICHARD GLOUCESTER Curse not thyself, fair creature: thou art both.
