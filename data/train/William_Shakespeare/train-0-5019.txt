MISTRESS PAGE That likewise have we thought upon, and thus.
Nan Page my daughter, and my little son,
And three or four more of their growth, weâ€™ll dress
Like urchins, oafs, and fairies, green and white,
With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads,
And rattles in their hands. Upon a sudden,
As Falstaff, she, and I are newly met,
Let them from forth a saw-pit rush at once,
With some diffused song. Upon their sight
We two in great amaz
Then let them all encircle him about,
And, fairy-like, to pinch the unclean knight,
And ask him why, that hour of fairy revel,
In their so sacred paths he dares to tread
In shape profane.
