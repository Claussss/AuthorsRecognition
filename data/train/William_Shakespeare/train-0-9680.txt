Will this capriccio hold in thee? Art sure? Go with me to my chamber and advise me.
I’ll send her straight away. Tomorrow
I’ll to the wars, she to her single sorrow. Why, these balls bound, there’s noise in it. ‘Tis hard:
A young man married is a man that’s marred.
Therefore away, and leave her bravely. Go.
The King has done you wrong, but hush ’tis so.
