HAMLET O God! Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder. HAMLET Murder? Murder most foul, as in the best it is,
But this most foul, strange, and unnatural. Haste, haste me to know it, that with wings as swift
As meditation or the thoughts of love
May sweep to my revenge. I find thee apt,
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf
Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
’Tis given out that, sleeping in mine orchard,
A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
Is by a forged process of my death
Rankly abused. But know, thou noble youth,
The serpent that did sting thy father’s life
Now wears his crown.
