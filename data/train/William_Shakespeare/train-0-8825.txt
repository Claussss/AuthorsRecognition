O I beseech you pardon me, my lord, in that. You may take my word, my lord, I know no man
Can justly praise but what he does affect.
I weigh my friends’ affection with mine own.
I’ll tell you true, I’ll call to you. ALL LORDS O, none so welcome. I take all and your several visitations
So kind to heart, ‘tis not enough to give.
Methinks I could deal kingdoms to my friends,
And ne’er be weary. Alcibiades,
Thou art a soldier, therefore seldom rich.
Giving a present
thy living
Is ’mongst the dead, and all the lands thou hast
Lie in a pitched field.
