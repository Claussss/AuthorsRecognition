All’s well, sir. Take my power i’th’ court for yours. My humble thanks. I had almost forgot
T’entreat your grace but in a small request,
And yet of moment too, for it concerns
Your lord; myself and other noble friends
Are partners in the business. Pray what is’t? Some dozen Romans of us, and your lord—
Best feather of our wing—have mingled sums
To buy a present for the Emperor,
Which I, the factor for the rest, have done
In France. ’Tis plate of rare device, and jewels
Of rich and exquisite form; their value’s great,
And I am something curious, being strange,
To have them in safe stowage. May it please you
To take them in protection?
