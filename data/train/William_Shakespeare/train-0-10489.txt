HERMIONE Nay, but you will? POLIXENES I may not, verily. HERMIONE Verily? You put me off with limber vows. But I,
Though you would seek t‘unsphere the stars with
oaths,
Should yet say ‘Sir, no going.’ Verily
You shall not go. A lady’s ‘verily’ ’s
As potent as a lord’s. Will you go yet?
Force me to keep you as a prisoner,
Not like a guest: so you shall pay your fees
When you depart, and save your thanks. How say
you?
My prisoner? or my guest? By your dread ‘verily’,
One of them you shall be.
