Nay, but hear me. Your sense pursues not mine. Either you are ignorant,
Or seem so craftily, and that’s not good. Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good
But graciously to know I am no better. Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
When it doth tax itself: as these black masks
Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder
Than beauty could, displayed. But mark me.
To be received plain, I’ll speak more gross.
Your brother is to die.
