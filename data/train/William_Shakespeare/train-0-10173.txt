They sound a parley. Enter two Senators, with others, on the walls of Corioles  (To the Senators) Tullus Aufidius, is he within your walls? FIRST SENATOR No, nor a man that fears you less than he:
That’s lesser than a little. Drum afar off  To the Volscians
Are bringing forth our youth. We’ll break our walls
Rather than they shall pound us up. Our gates,
Which yet seem shut, we have but pinned with rushes.
They’ll open of themselves.
