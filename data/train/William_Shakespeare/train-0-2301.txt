Being moved, he strikes, whate’er is in his way,
And whom he strikes his crooked tushes slay. ‘His brawny sides with hairy bristles armed
Are better proof than thy spear’s point can enter.
His short thick neck cannot be easily harmed.
Being ireful, on the lion he will venture. The thorny brambles and embracing bushes,
As fearful of him, part; through whom he rushes.
