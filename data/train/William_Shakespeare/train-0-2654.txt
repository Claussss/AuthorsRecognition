KING EDWARD Whether is her beauty by her words divine,
Or are her words sweet chaplains to her beauty?
Like as the wind doth beautify a sail
And as a sail becomes the unseen wind,
So do her words her beauties, beauty words.
O, that I were a honey-gathering bee
To bear the comb of virtue from this flower,
And not a poison-sucking, envious spider
To turn the juice I take to deadly venoml
Religion is austere, and beauty gentleâ€”
Too strict a guardian for so fair a ward.
O, that she were as is the air to me!
Why, so she is: for when I would embrace her,
This do I (embracing the air), and catch nothing but myself.
I must enjoy her, for I cannot beat
With reason and reproof fond love away.
