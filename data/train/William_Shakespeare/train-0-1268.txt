RICHARD OF GLOUCESTER (to King Edward) Why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points? KING EDWARD When we grow stronger, then we’ll make our claim.
Till then ’tis wisdom to conceal our meaning. Away with scrupulous wit! Now arms must rule. RICHARD OF GLOUCESTER And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.
Brother, we will proclaim you out of hand,
The bruit thereof will bring you many friends.
