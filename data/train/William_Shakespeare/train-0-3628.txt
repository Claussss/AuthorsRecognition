Lady, by yonder bless
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops— O swear not by the moon, th’inconstant moon
That monthly changes in her circled orb,
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable. What shall I swear by? JULIET Do not swear at all, Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
Which is the god of my idolatry,
And I’ll believe thee.
