They say that they have measured many a mile
To tread a measure with you on this grass. It is not so. Ask them how many inches
Is in one mile. If they have measured many,
The measure then of one is easily told. If to come hither you have measured miles,
And many miles, the Princess bids you tell
How many inches doth fill up one mile.
