CLEON Fear not, my lord, but think Your grace, that fed my country with your corn—
For which the people’s pray’rs still fall upon you—
Must in your child be thought on. If neglection
Should therein make me vile, the common body
By you relieved would force me to my duty.
But if to that my nature need a spur,
The gods revenge it upon me and mine
To th’ end of generation.
