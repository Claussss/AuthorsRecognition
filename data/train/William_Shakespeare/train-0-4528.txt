PRINCE HARRY Well then, once in my days I’ll be a madcap. SIR JOHN Why, that’s well said. PRINCE HARRY Well, come what will, I’ll tarry at home. SIR JOHN By the Lord, I’ll be a traitor then, when thou art king. PRINCE HARRY I care not. POINS Sir John, I prithee leave the Prince and me alone. I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure that he shall go.
