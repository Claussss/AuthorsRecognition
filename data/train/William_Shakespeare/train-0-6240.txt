Hey-ho, sing hey-ho, unto the green holly.
Most friendship is feigning, most loving, mere folly. Then hey-ho, the holly;
This life is most jolly. DUKE SENIOR (to Orlando) If that you were the good Sir Rowland’s son,
As you have whispered faithfully you were,
And as mine eye doth his effigies witness
Most truly limned and living in your face,
Be truly welcome hither. I am the Duke
That loved your father. The residue of your fortune,
Go to my cave and tell me. (To Adam) Good old man,
Thou art right welcome, as thy master is.—
(To Lords) Support him by the arm. (To Orlando) Give
me your hand,
And let me all your fortunes understand. Exeunt
