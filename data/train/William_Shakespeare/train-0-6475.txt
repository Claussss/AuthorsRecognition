KING CLAUDIUS It likes us well, And at our more considered time we’ll read,
 Answer, and think upon this business.
 Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour.
 Go to your rest; at night we’ll feast together.
 Most welcome home.
Exeunt Valtemand and Cornelius This business is very well ended.
My liege, and madam, to expostulate
What majesty should be, what duty is,
Why day is day, night night, and time is time,
Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
I will be brief. Your noble son is mad—
‘Mad’ call I it, for to define true madness,
What is’t but to be nothing else but mad?
But let that go.
