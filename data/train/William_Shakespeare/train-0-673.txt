And so it is. I wonder what it bodes. Marry, peace it bodes, and love, and quiet life;
An aweful rule and right supremacy,
And, to be short, what not thatâ€™s sweet and happy. Now fair befall thee, good Petruccio,
The wager thou hast won, and I will add
Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns,
Another dowry to another daughter,
For she is changed as she had never been.
