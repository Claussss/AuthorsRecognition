LUCIUS’ SERVANT Mark how strange it shows. Timon in this should pay more than he owes,
And e‘en as if your lord should wear rich jewels
And send for money for ’em. HORTENSIUS’ SERVANT I’m weary of this charge, the gods can witness.
I know my lord hath spent of Timon’s wealth,
And now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth.
