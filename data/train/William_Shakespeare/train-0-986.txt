Enter King Henry and attendants Buckingham, doth York intend no harm to us,
That thus he marcheth with thee arm in arm? In all submission and humility
York doth present himself unto your highness. Then what intends these forces thou dost bring? To heave the traitor Somerset from hence,
And fight against that monstrous rebel Cade,
Who since I heard to be discomfited.
