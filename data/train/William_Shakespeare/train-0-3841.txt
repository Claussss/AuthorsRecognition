Relent, sweet Hermia; and, Lysander, yield
Thy crazed title to my certain right. You have her father’s love, Demetrius;
Let me have Hermia’s. Do you marry him. Scornful Lysander! True, he hath my love;
And what is mine my love shall render him,
And she is mine, and all my right of her
I do estate unto Demetrius.
