Now does he feel His secret murders sticking on his hands.
Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach.
Those he commands move only in command,
Nothing in love. Now does he feel his title
Hang loose about him, like a giantâ€™s robe
Upon a dwarfish thief. Who then shall blame His pestered senses to recoil and start
When all that is within him does condemn
Itself for being there?
