You taught me language, and my profit on’t
Is I know how to curse. The red plague rid you
For learning me your language! Hag-seed, hence! Fetch us in fuel. And be quick, thou’rt best,
To answer other business.—Shrug’st thou, malice?
If thou neglect’st or dost unwillingly
What I command, I’ll rack thee with old cramps,
Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar,
That beasts shall tremble at thy din.
