Follow, I pray you. Exeunt 4.1
Enter Prospero, Ferdinand, and Miranda 
PROSPFRO (to Ferdinand) If I have too austerely punished you,
Your compensation makes amends, for I
Have given you here a third of mine own tife—
Or that for which I live—who once again
I tender to thy hand. All thy vexations
Were but my trials of thy love, and thou
Hast strangely stood the test. Here, afore heaven,
I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,
Do not smile at me that I boast of her,
For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise,
And make it halt behind her.
