Farewell, kind lord. Fight valiantly todayâ€”
And yet I do thee wrong to mind thee of it,
For thou art framed of the firm truth of valour.
Exit Salisbury He is as full of valour as of kindness,
Princely in both.
Enter King Harry, behind O that we now had here But one ten thousand of those men in England
That do no work today.
