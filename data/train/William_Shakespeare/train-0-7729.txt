MORE Most willingly I go. My lords, if you will visit me at Chelsea
We’ll go a-fishing, and with a cunning net,
Not like weak film, we’ll catch none but the great.
Farewell, my noble lords. Why, this is right:
Good morrow to the sun, to state good night. Will you subscribe, my lords? Instantly, good Sir Thomas.
