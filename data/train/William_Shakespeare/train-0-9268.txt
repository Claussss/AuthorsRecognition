Though age from folly could not give me freedom,
It does from childishness. Can Fulvia die? ANTONY She’s dead, my queen. He offers letters Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read
The garboils she awaked. At the last, best,
See when and where she died. O most false love! Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill
With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,
In Fulvia’s death how mine received shall be.
