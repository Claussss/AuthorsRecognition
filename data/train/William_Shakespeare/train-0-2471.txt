And talked of virtue—O unlooked-for evil,
When virtue is profaned in such a devil! ‘Why should the worm intrude the maiden bud,
Or hateful cuckoos hatch in sparrows’ nests,
Or toads infect fair founts with venom mud,
Or tyrant folly lurk in gentle breasts,
Or kings be breakers of their own behests? But no perfection is so absolute
That some impurity doth not pollute.
