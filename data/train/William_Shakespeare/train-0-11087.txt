When shall we see again? Enter Cymbeline and lords Alack, the King! Thou basest thing, avoid hence, from my sight!
If after this command thou fraught the court
With thy unworthiness, thou diest. Away.
Thouâ€™rt poison to my blood. The gods protect you, And bless the good remainders of the court!
I am gone.
