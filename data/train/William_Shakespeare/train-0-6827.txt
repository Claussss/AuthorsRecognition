SIR TOBY We did keep time, sir, in our catches. Sneck up! MALVOLIO Sir Toby, I must be round with you. My lady bade me tell you that though she harbours you as her kinsman sheâ€™s nothing allied to your disorders. If you can separate yourself and your misdemeanours you are welcome to the house. If not, an it would please you to take leave of her she is very willing to bid you farewell.
