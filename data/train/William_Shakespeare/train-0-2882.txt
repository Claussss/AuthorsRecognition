DROMIO OF SYRACUSE to Antipholus ’Tis true she rides me, and I long for grass.
’Tis so, I am an ass; else it could never be
But I should know her as well as she knows me. Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,
To put the finger in the eye and weep
Whilst man and master laughs my woes to scorn.
(To Antipholus) Come, sir, to dinner.—Dromio, keep
the gate.—
Husband, I’ll dine above with you today,
And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.—
Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,
Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter.—
Come, sister.—Dromio, play the porter well.
