Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,
For fear they die before their pardon come. My hand shall go. By heaven it shall not go. Sirs, strive no more. Such withered herbs as these
Are meet for plucking up, and therefore mine. Sweet father, if I shall be thought thy son,
Let me redeem my brothers both from death.
