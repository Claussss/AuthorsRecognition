DUCHESS OF YORK God bless thee, and put meekness in thy breast,
Love, charity, obedience, and true duty. RICHARD GLOUCESTER Amen. (Aside) ‘And make me die a good old man.’
That is the butt-end of a mother’s blessing;
I marvel that her grace did leave it out. You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers
That bear this heavy mutual load of moan,
Now cheer each other in each other’s love.
Though we have spent our harvest of this king,
We are to reap the harvest of his son.
The broken rancour of your high-swoll’n hearts
But lately splinted, knit, and joined together,
Must gently be preserved, cherished, and kept.
Meseemeth good that, with some little train,
Forthwith from Ludlow the young Prince be fet
Hither to London to be crowned our king.
