GRAZIANO Know him? Ay. Signor Graziano, I cry your gentle pardon.
These bloody accidents must excuse my manners
That so neglected you. GRAZIANO I am glad to see you. How do you, Cassio? O, a chair, a chair! GRAZIANO Roderigo. He, he, ’tis he. Enter attendants with a chair O, that’s well said, the chair!
Some good man bear him carefully from hence.
I’ll fetch the general’s surgeon. (To Bianca) For you,
mistress,
Save you your labour. He that lies slain here, Cassio,
Was my dear friend. What malice was between you?
