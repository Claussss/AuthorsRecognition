The posture of your blows are yet unknown;
But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,
And leave them honeyless. ANTONY Not stingless too. BRUTUS O yes, and soundless too, For you have stolen their buzzing, Antony,
And very wisely threat before you sting. Villains, you did not so when your vile daggers
Hacked one another in the sides of Caesar.
You showed your teeth like apes, and fawned like
hounds,
And bowed like bondmen, kissing Caesarâ€™s feet,
Whilst damn
Struck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!
