Enter Shrewsbury, Surrey, Palmer; Cholmley Lord Mayor, his majesty, receiving notice
Of this most dangerous insurrection,
Hath sent my lord of Surrey and myself,
Sir Thomas Palmer, and our followers
To add unto your forces our best means
For pacifying of this mutiny.
In Godâ€™s name, then, set on with happy speed.
The King laments if one true subject bleed.
