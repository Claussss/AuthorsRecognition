Mort dieu! They quoit at us and kill us up!
No less than forty thousand wicked elders
Have forty lean slaves this day stoned to death. O, that I were some other countryman!
This day hath set derision on the French,
And all the world will blurt and scorn at us. KING OF FRANCE What, is there no hope left?
