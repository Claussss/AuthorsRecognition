I am woe forâ€™t, sir. Irreparable is the loss, and patience
Says it is past her cure. I rather think You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace
For the like loss I have her sovereign aid,
And rest myself content. You the like loss? As great to me as late; and supportable
To make the dear loss have I means much weaker
Than you may call to comfort you, for I
Have lost my daughter.
