AGAMEMNON (to the Greeks) This Trojan scorns us, or the men of Troy
Are ceremonious courtiers. Courtiers as free, as debonair, unarmed,
As bending angels—that’s their fame in peace.
But when they would seem soldiers they have galls,
Good arms, strong joints, true swords—and great
Jove’s acorn
Nothing so full of heart. But peace, Aeneas,
Peace, Trojan; lay thy finger on thy lips.
The worthiness of praise distains his worth,
If that the praised himself bring the praise forth.
But what, repining, the enemy commends,
That breath fame blows; that praise, sole pure,
transcends.
