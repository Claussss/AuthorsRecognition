Good fellows all, The latest of my wealth I’ll share amongst you.
Wherever we shall meet, for Timon’s sake
Let’s yet be fellows. Let’s shake our heads and say,
As ‘twere a knell unto our master’s fortunes,
’We have seen better days.’ He gives them money Let each take some. Nay, put out all your hands. Not one word more.
Thus part we rich in sorrow, parting poor.
