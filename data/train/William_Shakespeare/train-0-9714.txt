Flourish of trumpets. Enter the Duke of Florence, Bertram, a drummer and trumpeters, soldiers, and Paroles 
DUKE (to Bertram) The general of our horse thou art, and we,

Upon thy promising fortune. A charge too heavy for my strength, but yet
We’ll strive to bear it for your worthy sake
To th’extreme edge of hazard.
