Enter Friar Laurence with lantern, crow, and spade FRIAR LAURENCE Saint Francis be my speed! How oft tonight
Have my old feet stumbled at graves? Who’s there? Here’s one, a friend, and one that knows you well. FRIAR LAURENCE Bliss be upon you. Tell me, good my friend,
What torch is yon that vainly lends his light 125
To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,
It burneth in the Capels’ monument.
