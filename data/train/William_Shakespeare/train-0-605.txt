Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little. Why then, the beef, and let the mustard rest. Nay, then I will not. You shall have the mustard,
Or else you get no beef of Grumio. Then both, or one, or anything thou wilt. Why then, the mustard without the beef. Go, get thee gone, thou false, deluding slave,
(Beating him) That feedâ€™st me with the very name of
meat.
Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you,
That triumph thus upon my misery.
Go, get thee gone, I say.
