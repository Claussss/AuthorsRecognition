For in my death I murder shameful scorn;
My shame so dead, mine honour is new born. â€˜Dear lord of that dear jewel I have lost,
What legacy shall I bequeath to thee?
My resolution, love, shall be thy boast,
By whose example thou revenged mayst be.
How Tarquin must be used, read it in me. Myself, thy friend, will kill myself, thy foe;
And for my sake serve thou false Tarquin so.
