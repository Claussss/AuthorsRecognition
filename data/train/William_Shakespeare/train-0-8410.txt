OTHELLO What, now? EMILIA But now, my lord. It is the very error of the moon,
She comes more nearer earth than she was wont,
And makes men mad. Cassio, my lord, hath killed a young Venetian
Called Roderigo. OTHELLO Roderigo killed And Cassio killed? EMILIA No, Cassio is not killed. Not Cassio killed? Then murderâ€™s out of tune,
And sweet revenge grows harsh.
