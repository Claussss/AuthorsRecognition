My gracious lord, here is the bag of gold. SATURNINUS (to Titus) Two of thy whelps, fell curs of bloody kind,
Have here bereft my brother of his life.
Sirs, drag them from the pit unto the prison.
There let them bide until we have devised
Some never-heard-of torturing pain for them. What, are they in this pit? O wondrous thing!
How easily murder is discovered!
