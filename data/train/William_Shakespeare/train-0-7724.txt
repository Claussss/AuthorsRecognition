Yet, my good lordâ€” Let me conclude my speech. As subjects share no portion in the conquest
Of their true sovereign other than the merit
That from the sovereign guerdons the true subject,
So the good Emperor in a friendly league
Of amity with England will not soil
His honour with the theft of English spoil.
