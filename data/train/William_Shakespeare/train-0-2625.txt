KING EDWARD Hath she been fairer, Warwick, than she is? EARL OF WARWICK My gracious King, fair is she not at all
If that her self were by to stain herself
As I have seen her when she was her self. KING EDWARD aside What strange enchantment lurked in those her eyes,
When they excelled this excellence they have,
That now her dim decline hath power to draw
My subject eyes from piercing majesty
To gaze on her with doting admiration?
