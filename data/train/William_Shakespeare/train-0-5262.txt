What thing in honour had my father lost
That need to be revived and breathed in me?
The King that loved him, as the state stood then,
Was force perforce compelled to banish him;
And then that Henry Bolingbroke and he, 115
Being mounted and both roused in their seats,
Their neighing coursers daring of the spur,
Their armed staves in charge, their beavers down,
Their eyes of fire sparkling through sights of steel,
And the loud trumpet blowing them together,
Then, then, when there was nothing could have stayed
My father from the breast of Bolingbrokeâ€”
O, when the King did throw his warder down,
His own life hung upon the staff he threw;
Then threw he down himself and all their lives 125
That by indictment and by dint of sword
Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke.
