Exeunt Pembroke and Stafford But ere I go, Hastings and Montague,
Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,
Are near’st to Warwick by blood and by alliance.
Tell me if you love Warwick more than me.
If it be so, then both depart to him—
I rather wish you foes than hollow friends.
But if you mind to hold your true obedience,
Give me assurance with some friendly vow
That I may never have you in suspect.
