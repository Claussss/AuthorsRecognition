You speak to Casca, and to such a man
That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold. My hand.
Be factious for redress of all these griefs,
And I will set this foot of mine as far
As who goes farthest.
They join hands CASSIUS There’s a bargain made. Now know you, Casca, I have moved already
Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans
To undergo with me an enterprise
Of honourable-dangerous consequence.
And I do know by this they stay for me
In Pompey’s Porch; for now, this fearful night,
There is no stir or walking in the streets,
And the complexion of the element
In favour’s like the work we have in hand,
Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.
