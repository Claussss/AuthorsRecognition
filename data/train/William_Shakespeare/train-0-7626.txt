He gives More a staff of office My lord, for to deny my sovereign’s bounty
Were to drop precious stones into the heaps
Whence first they came.
To urge my imperfections in excuse
Were all as stale as custom. No, my lord,
My service is my king’s. Good reason why,
Since life or death hangs on our sovereign’s eye.
