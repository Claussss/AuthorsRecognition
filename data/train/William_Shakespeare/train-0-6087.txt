He takes away Lucius’ instrument, then opens the book  Let me see, let me see, is not the leaf turned down
Where I left reading? Here it is, I think. Enter the Ghost of Caesar  How ill this taper burns! Ha! Who comes here?
I think it is the weakness of mine eyes
That shapes this monstrous apparition.
It comes upon me. Art thou any thing?
Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil,
That mak’st my blood cold and my hair to stare?
Speak to me what thou art.
