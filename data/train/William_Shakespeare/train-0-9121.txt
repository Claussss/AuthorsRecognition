I drink to th’ general joy of th’whole table,
And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss.
Would he were here. To all and him we thirst,
And all to all. Our duties, and the pledge. MACBETH (seeing the Ghost) Avaunt, and quit my sight! Let the earth hide thee.
Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold.
Thou hast no speculation in those eyes
Which thou dost glare with.
