BOTTOM We will meet, and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously. Take pains; be perfect. Adieu. QUINCE At the Duke’s oak we meet. BOTTOM Enough. Hold, or cut bowstrings. Exeunt 2.1
Enter a Fairy at one door and Robin Goodfellow, a puck, at another How now, spirit, whither wander you? Over hill, over dale,
Thorough bush, thorough brier,
Over park, over pale,
Thorough flood, thorough fire:
I do wander everywhere
Swifter than the moon
And I serve the Fairy Queen
To dew her orbs upon the green.
The cowslips tall her pensioners be.
In their gold coats spots you see;
Those be rubies, fairy favours;
In those freckles live their savours.
I must go seek some dewdrops here,
And hang a pearl in every cowslip’s ear.
Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I’ll be gone.
Our Queen and all her elves come here anon.
