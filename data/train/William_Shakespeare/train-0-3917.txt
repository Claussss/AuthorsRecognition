TITANIA (to the Fairies) Come, wait upon him, lead him to my bower.
The moon, methinks, looks with a wat’ry eye,
And when she weeps, weeps every little flower,
Lamenting some enforced chastity.
Tie up my love’s tongue; bring him silently. Exeunt 3.2
Enter Oberon, King of Fairies I wonder if Titania be awaked,
Then what it was that next came in her eye,
Which she must dote on in extremity.
