Nay, be not angry, sir. ’Lack, to what end? Who dares not stand his foe, I’ll be his friend,
For if he’ll do as he is made to do,
I know he’ll quickly fly my friendship too.
You have put me into rhyme. Farewell; you’re angry. Still going? This a lord? O noble misery,
To be i‘th’ field and ask ‘What news?’ of me!
Today how many would have given their honours
To have saved their carcasses-took heel to do’t,
And yet died too! I, in mine own woe charmed,
Could not find death where I did hear him groan,
Nor feel him where he struck. Being an ugly monster,
‘Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,
Sweet words, or hath more ministers than we
That draw his knives i’th’ war. Well, I will find him;
For being now a favourer to the Briton,
No more a Briton, I have resumed again
The part I came in. Fight I will no more,
But yield me to the veriest hind that shall
Once touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is
Here made by th’ Roman; great the answer be
Britons must take. For me, my ransom’s death,
On either side I come to spend my breath,
Which neither here I’ll keep nor bear again,
But end it by some means for Innogen.
