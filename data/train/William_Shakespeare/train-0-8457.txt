LEAR Kent, on thy life, no more! My life I never held but as a pawn
To wage against thy enemies, nor fear to lose it,
Thy safety being the motive. LEAR Out of my sight! See better, Lear, and let me still remain
The true blank of thine eye. LEAR Now, by Apollo- Now, by Apollo, King, thou swearâ€™st thy gods in vain.
