Sir, you of Troy, call you yourself Aeneas? Ay, Greek, that is my name. AGAMEMNON What’s your affair, I pray you? Sir, pardon, ’tis for Agamemnon’s ears. He hears naught privately that comes from Troy. Nor I from Troy come not to whisper him.
I bring a trumpet to awake his ear,
To set his sense on the attentive bent,
And then to speak.
