5.3
Enter Paris and his Page, with flowers, sweet water, and a torch Give me thy torch, boy. Hence, and stand aloof.
Yet put it out, for I would not be seen. His Page puts out the torch Under yon yew trees lay thee all along,
Holding thy ear close to the hollow ground.
So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread, 5
Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me
As signal that thou hearâ€™st something approach.
Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee. Go.
