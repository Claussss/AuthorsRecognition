I dare not know, my lord. How, ‘dare not’? Do not? Do you know, and dare not?
Be intelligent to me. ‘Tis thereabouts.
For to yourself what you do know you must,
And cannot say you ‘dare not’. Good Camillo,
Your changed complexions are to me a mirror
Which shows me mine changed, too; for I must be
A party in this alteration, finding
Myself thus altered with’t.
