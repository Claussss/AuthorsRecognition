O father Abram, what these Christians are,
Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect 160
The thoughts of others! (To Bassanio) Pray you tell me
this:
If he should break his day, what should I gain
By the exaction of the forfeiture?
A pound of manâ€™s flesh taken from a man
Is not so estimable, profitable neither,
As flesh of muttons, beeves, or goats. I say,
To buy his favour I extend this friendship.
If he will take it, so. If not, adieu,
And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.
