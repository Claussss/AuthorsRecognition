LOUIS THE DAUPHIN Lady, with me, with me thy fortune lies. There where my fortune lives, there my life dies. KING JOHN (to the Bastard) Cousin, go draw our puissance together.â€” Exit the Bastard  France, I am burned up with inflaming wrath,
A rage whose heat hath this condition:
That nothing can allay, nothing but blood,
The blood, and dearest-valued blood, of France.
