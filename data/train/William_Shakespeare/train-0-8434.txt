OTHELLO O villain! CASSIO Most heathenish and most gross. Now here’s another discontented paper
Found in his pocket too, and this it seems
Roderigo meant to’ve sent this damned villain,
But that, belike, Iago in the interim
Came in and satisfied him. OTHELLO (to Iago) O thou pernicious caitiff! How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief
That was my wife’s?
