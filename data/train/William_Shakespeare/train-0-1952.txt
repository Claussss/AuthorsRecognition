SECOND MURDERER You are deceived. Your brother Gloucester hates you. O no, he loves me, and he holds me dear.
Go you to him from me. FIRST MURDERER Ay, so we will. Tell him, when that our princely father York
 Blessed his three sons with his victorious arm,
 And charged us from his soul to love each other,
 He little thought of this divided friendship.
 Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.
