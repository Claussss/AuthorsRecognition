I have some wounds upon me, and they smart
To hear themselves remembered. Should they not, Well might they fester ‘gainst ingratitude,
And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses—
Whereof we have ta’en good, and good store—of all
The treasure in this field achieved and city,
We render you the tenth, to be ta’en forth
Before the common distribution
At your only choice.
