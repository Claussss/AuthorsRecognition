MALCOLM (aside to Donalbain) Nor our strong sorrow Upon the foot of motion. Look to the lady; Exit Lady Macbeth, attended And when we have our naked frailties hid,
That suffer in exposure, let us meet
And question this most bloody piece of work,
To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us.
In the great hand of God I stand, and thence
Against the undivulged pretence I fight
Of treasonous malice.
