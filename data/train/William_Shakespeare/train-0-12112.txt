O, he that’s freckle-faced? The same, my lord.
 Are they not sweet ones? Yes, they are well. Methinks,
 Being so few and well disposed, they show
Great and fine art in nature. He’s white-haired—
Not wanton white, but such a manly colour
Next to an auburn, tough and nimble set,
Which shows an active soul. His arms are brawny,
Lined with strong sinews—to the shoulder piece
Gently they swell, like women new-conceived,
Which speaks him prone to labour, never fainting
Under the weight of arms; stout-hearted, still,
But when he stirs, a tiger. He’s grey-eyed,
Which yields compassion where he conquers; sharp
To spy advantages, and where he finds ’em,
He’s swift to make ’em his. He does no wrongs,
Nor takes none. He’s round-faced, and when he smiles
He shows a lover; when he frowns, a soldier.
About his head he wears the winner’s oak,
And in it stuck the favour of his lady.
His age, some six-and-thirty. In his hand
He bears a charging staff embossed with silver.
