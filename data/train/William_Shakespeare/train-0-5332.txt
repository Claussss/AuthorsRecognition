CLARENCE (to Lord Chief Justice) Well, you must now speak Sir John Falstaff fair,
Which swims against your stream of quality. LORD CHIEF JUSTICE Sweet princes, what I did I did in honour,
Led by th’impartial conduct of my soul;
And never shall you see that I will beg
A ragged and forestalled remission.
If truth and upright innocency fail me,
I’ll to the King my master, that is dead,
And tell him who hath sent me after him.
