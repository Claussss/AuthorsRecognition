Bootless is flight—they follow us with wings,
And weak we are, and cannot shun pursuit. Enter Richard, running Ah, Warwick, why hast thou withdrawn thyself?
Thy brother’s blood the thirsty earth hath drunk,
Broached with the steely point of Clifford’s lance.
And in the very pangs of death he cried,
Like to a dismal clangour heard from far,
‘Warwick, revenge—brother, revenge my death!’
So, underneath the belly of their steeds
That stained their fetlocks in his smoking blood,
The noble gentleman gave up the ghost.
