Enter Troilus PANDARUS O here he comes.—How now, how now? TROILUS Sirrah, walk off. Exit Man PANDARUS Have you seen my cousin? No, Pandarus, I stalk about her door
Like a strange soul upon the Stygian banks
Staying for waftage. O be thou my Charon,
And give me swift transportance to those fields
Where I may wallow in the lily beds
Proposed for the deserver. O gentle Pandar,
From Cupid’s shoulder pluck his painted wings
And fly with me to Cressid.
