ADAM (coming forward) Sweet masters, be patient. For your fatherâ€™s remembrance, be at accord. OLIVER (to Orlando) Let me go, I say. ORLANDO I will not till I please. You shall hear me. My father charged you in his will to give me good education. You have trained me like a peasant, obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in me, and I will no longer endure it. Therefore allow me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or give me the poor allottery my father left me by testament. With that I will go buy my fortunes.
