But, my good lord, How now for mitigation of this bill
Urged by the Commons? Doth his majesty
Incline to it, or no? CANTERBURY He seems indifferent, Or rather swaying more upon our part
Than cherishing thâ€™exhibitors against us;
For I have made an offer to his majesty,
Upon our spiritual convocation
And in regard of causes now in hand,
Which I have opened to his grace at large:
As touching France, to give a greater sum
Than ever at one time the clergy yet
Did to his predecessors part withal.
