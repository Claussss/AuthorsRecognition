DUKE (to Egeon) I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years
Have I been patron to Antipholus,
During which time he neâ€™er saw Syracusa.
I see thy age and dangers make thee dote. Enter from the prioryAntipholus
of Syracuse, wearing the chain, and Dromio of Syracuse Most mighty Duke, behold a man much wronged.
