My noble lord, would we so much had known!
The Council’s warrant hastened our dispatch.
It had not else been done so suddenly. Sir Thomas More humbly upon his knee
Did beg the lives of all, since on his word
They did so gently yield. The King hath granted it,
And made him Lord High Chancellor of England,
According as he worthily deserves.
Since Lincoln’s life cannot be had again,
Then for the rest, from my dread sovereign’s lips,
I here pronounce free pardon for them all—
