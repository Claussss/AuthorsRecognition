That to his borrowed bed he make retire,
And stoop to honour, not to foul desire. Quoth she, â€˜Reward not hospitality
With such black payment as thou hast pretended.
Mud not the fountain that gave drink to thee;
Mar not the thing that cannot be amended;
End thy ill aim before thy shoot be ended. He is no woodman that doth bend his bow
To strike a poor unseasonable doe.
