What fear is this which startles in our ears? CHIEF WATCHMAN Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain,
And Romeo dead, and Juliet, dead before,
Warm, and new killed. Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes. CHIEF WATCHMAN Here is a friar, and slaughtered Romeo’s man,
With instruments upon them fit to open
These dead men’s tombs.
