GEORGE OF CLARENCE What else? And that succession be determined. Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part. But with the first of all your chief affairs,
Let me entreat—for I command no more—
That Margaret your queen and my son Edward
Be sent for, to return from France with speed.
For, till I see them here, by doubtful fear
My joy of liberty is half eclipsed.
