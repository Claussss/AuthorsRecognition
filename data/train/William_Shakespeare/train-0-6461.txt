But, my good lord— Wherefore should you do this? Ay, my lord. I would know that. Marry, sir, here’s my drift, And I believe it is a fetch of warrant:
You laying these slight sullies on my son,
As ‘twere a thing a little soiled i’th’ working,
Mark you, your party in converse, him you would
sound,
Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured
He closes with you in this consequence:
‘Good sir’, or so, or ‘friend’, or ‘gentleman’,
According to the phrase and the addition
Of man and country.
