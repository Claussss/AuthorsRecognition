CELIA Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman. Rosalind and Celia turn to go ORLANDO (aside) Can I not say ‘I thank you’? My better parts
Are all thrown down, and that which here stands up
Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block. ROSALIND (to Celia) He calls us back. My pride fell with my fortunes,
I’ll ask him what he would.—Did you call, sir?
Sir, you have wrestled well, and overthrown
More than your enemies.
