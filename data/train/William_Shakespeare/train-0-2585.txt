Yet sometime ‘Tarquin’ was pronounced plain,
But through his teeth, as if the name he tore.
This windy tempest, till it blow up rain,
Held back his sorrow’s tide to make it more.
At last it rains, and busy winds give o’er. Then son and father weep with equal strife
Who should weep most, for daughter or for wife.
