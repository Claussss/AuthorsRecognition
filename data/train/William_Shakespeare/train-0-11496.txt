Then let us both be sudden. GONZALO (awaking) Now good angels Preserve the King! ALONSO (awaking) Why, how now? Ho, awake! The others awake (To Antonio and Sebastian) Why are you drawn?
(To Gonzalo) Wherefore this ghastly looking? What’s the matter? Whiles we stood here securing your repose,
Even now we heard a hollow burst of bellowing,
Like bulls, or rather lions. Did’t not wake you?
It struck mine ear most terribly.
