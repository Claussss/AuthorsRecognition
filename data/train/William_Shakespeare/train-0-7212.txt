PANDARUS Do, do. Tear my bright hair, and scratch my praised cheeks,
Crack my clear voice with sobs, and break my heart
With sounding ‘Troilus’. I will not go from Troy.  4.4
Enter Paris, Troilus, Aeneas, Deiphobus, Antenor, and Diomedes It is great morning, and the hour prefixed
Of her delivery to this valiant Greek
Comes fast upon us. Good my brother Troilus,
Tell you the lady what she is to do,
And haste her to the purpose.
