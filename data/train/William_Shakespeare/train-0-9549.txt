I shall remain your debtor. I your servant. Adieu, good Queen. I must attend on Caesar. Farewell, and thanks. Exit Dolabella Now, Iras, what thinkâ€™st thou? Thou, an Egyptian puppet shall be shown
In Rome, as well as I. Mechanic slaves
With greasy aprons, rules, and hammers shall
Uplift us to the view. In their thick breaths,
Rank of gross diet, shall we be enclouded,
And forced to drink their vapour.
