Why then, I know the extremity, my lord.
I must return to prison, whence I came. DAUPHIN Return? I hope thou wilt not! What bird that hath escaped the fowler’s gin
Will not beware how she’s ensnared again?
Or what is he so senseless and secure
That, having hardly passed a dangerous gulf,
Will put himself in peril there again?
