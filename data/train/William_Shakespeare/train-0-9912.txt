Which welcome we’ll accept, feast here a while,
Until our stars that frown lend us a smile. Exeunt Sc. 5
Enter Gower Here have you seen a mighty king
His child, iwis, to incest bring;
A better prince and benign lord
Prove awe-full both in deed and word.
Be quiet then, as men should be,
Till he hath passed necessity.
I’ll show you those in trouble’s reign,
Losing a mite, a mountain gain.
The good in conversation,
To whom I give my benison,
Is still at Tarsus where each man
Thinks all is writ he speken can,
And to remember what he does
His statue build to make him glorious.
But tidings to the contrary
Are brought your eyes. What need speak I?
