I beseech your grace to pardon me, and do withal
Forbear your conference with the noble Duke. We know thy charge, Brackenbury, and will obey. RICHARD GLOUCESTER We are the Queen’s abjects, and must obey.
Brother, farewell. I will unto the King,
And whatsoe‘er you will employ me in—
Were it to call King Edward’s widow ‘sister’—
I will perform it to enfranchise you.
Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood
Touches me dearer than you can imagine.
