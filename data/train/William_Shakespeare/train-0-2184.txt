Exit Catesby RATCLIFFE My lord? KING RICHARD Sawâ€™st thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland? Thomas the Earl of Surrey and himself,
Much about cockshut time, from troop to troop
Went through the army, cheering up the soldiers. KING RICHARD So, I am satisfied. Give me some wine.
I have not that alacrity of spirit,
Nor cheer of mind, that I was wont to have.
