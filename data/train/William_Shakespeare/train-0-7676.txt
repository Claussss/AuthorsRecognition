MORRIS You coxcomb! FALKNER Nay, you ha’ poached me, you ha’ given me a hire, it’s here, here. Away, you kind ass. Come, sir, dry your eyes.
Keep your old place, and mend these fooleries. FALKNER I care not to be turned off, an ’twere a ladder, so it be in my humour or the Fates beckon to me. Nay, pray, sir, if the Destinies spin me a fine thread, Falkner flies another pitch. And to avoid the headache, hereafter before I’ll be a hairmonger I’ll be a whoremonger.
