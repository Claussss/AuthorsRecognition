Alack, alack! Enter Camidius Our fortune on the sea is out of breath,
And sinks most lamentably. Had our general
Been what he knew himself, it had gone well.
O, he has given example for our flight
Most grossly by his own. Ay, are you thereabouts? Why then, good night indeed! Toward Peloponnesus are they fled.
