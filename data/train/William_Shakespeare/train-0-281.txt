Why, Valentine, what braggartism is this? Pardon me, Proteus, all I can is nothing
To her whose worth makes other worthies nothing.
She is alone. Then let her alone. Not for the world. Why man, she is mine own,
And I as rich in having such a jewel
As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,
The water nectar, and the rocks pure gold.
Forgive me that I do not dream on thee
Because thou seest me dote upon my love.
My foolish rival, that her father likes
Only for his possessions are so huge,
Is gone with her along, and I must after;
For love, thou knowâ€™st, is full of jealousy.
