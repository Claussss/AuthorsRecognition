EDWARD (to York) See, noble father, where they both do come—
The only props unto the house of York! Now, by my sword, well hast thou fought today;
By th’ mass, so did we all. I thank you, Richard.
God knows how long it is I have to live,
And it hath pleased him that three times today
You have defended me from imminent death.
Well, lords, we have not got that which we have—
’Tis not enough our foes are this time fled,
Being opposites of such repairing nature.
