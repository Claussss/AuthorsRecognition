SECOND GAMEKEEPER But if thou be a king, where is thy crown? My crown is in my heart, not on my head;
Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,
Nor to be seen. My crown is called content—
A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy. SECOND GAMEKEEPER Well, if you be a king crowned with content,
Your crown content and you must be contented
To go along with us—for, as we think,
You are the king King Edward hath deposed,
And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance
Will apprehend you as his enemy.
