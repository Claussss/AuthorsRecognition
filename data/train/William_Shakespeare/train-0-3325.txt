KING RICHARD Farewell, my lord. Securely I espy
Virtue with valour couched in thine eye.—
Order the trial, Marshal, and begin. LORD MARSHAL Harry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,
Receive thy lance; and God defend the right! An officer bears a lance to Bolingbroke BOLINGBROKE Strong as a tower in hope, I cry ‘Amen!’
