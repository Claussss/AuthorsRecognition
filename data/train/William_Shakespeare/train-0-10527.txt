SECOND LADY Who taught ’this? I learned it out of women’s faces. Pray now,
What colour are your eyebrows? Blue, my lord. Nay, that’s a mock. I have seen a lady’s nose
That has been blue, but not her eyebrows. Hark ye, The Queen your mother rounds apace. We shall
Present our services to a fine new prince
One of these days, and then you’d wanton with us,
If we would have you.
