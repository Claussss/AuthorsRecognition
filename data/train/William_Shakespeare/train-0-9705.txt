COUNTESS What is the matter? LAVATCH Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some comfort. Your son will not be killed so soon as I thought he would. COUNTESS Why should he be killed? LAVATCH So say I, madam—if he run away, as I hear he does. The danger is in standing to’t; that’s the loss of men, though it be the getting of children. Here they come will tell you more. For my part, I only heard your son was run away. [Exit]
