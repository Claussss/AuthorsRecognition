Which purchase if thou make, for fear of slips
Set thy seal manual on my wax-red lips. ‘A thousand kisses buys my heart from me;
And pay them at thy leisure, one by one.
What is ten hundred touches unto thee?
Are they not quickly told, and quickly gone? Say for non-payment that the debt should double,
Is twenty hundred kisses such a trouble?’
