The King my father, sir, has drunk to you,
Wishing it so much blood unto your life. I thank both him and you, and pledge him freely.
He pledges the King And further he desires to know of you
Of whence you are, your name and parentage. A gentleman of Tyre, my name Pericles,
My education been in arts and arms,
Who, looking for adventures in the world,
Was by the rough unconstant seas bereft
Unfortunately both of ships and men,
And after shipwreck driven upon this shore.
