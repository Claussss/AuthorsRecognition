Why, that’s my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee,
But yet thou shalt have freedom.—So, so, so.—
To the King’s ship, invisible as thou art!
There shalt thou find the mariners asleep
Under the hatches. The Master and the Boatswain
Being awake, enforce them to this place,
And presently, I prithee. I drink the air before me, and return
Or ere your pulse twice beat.
