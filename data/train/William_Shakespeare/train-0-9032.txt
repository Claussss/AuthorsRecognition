Time and the hour runs through the roughest day. Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure. Give me your favour. My dull brain was wrought
With things forgotten. (To Ross and Angus) Kind
gentlemen, your pains
Are registered where every day I turn
The leaf to read them. Let us toward the King.
(Aside to Banquo) Think upon what hath chanced, and
at more time,
The interim having weighed it, let us speak
Our free hearts each to other.
