Exeunt Rosalind and Celia DUKE SENIOR I do remember in this shepherd boy
Some lively touches of my daughterâ€™s favour. My lord, the first time that I ever saw him,
Methought he was a brother to your daughter.
But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,
And hath been tutored in the rudiments
Of many desperate studies by his uncle,
Whom he reports to be a great magician
Obscured in the circle of this forest.
