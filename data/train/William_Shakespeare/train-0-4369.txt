To offend and judge are distinct offices,
And of opposed natures. ARAGON What is here? He reads the schedule
‘The fire seven times tried this;
Seven times tried that judgement is
That did never choose amiss.
Some there be that shadows kiss;
Such have but a shadow’s bliss.
There be fools alive, iwis,
Silvered o’er; and so was this.
Take what wife you will to bed,
I will ever be your head.
So be gone; you are sped.’
Still more fool I shall appear
By the time I linger here.
With one fool’s head I came to woo,
But I go away with two.
Sweet, adieu. I’ll keep my oath
Patiently to bear my wroth.
Flourish of cornetts.
