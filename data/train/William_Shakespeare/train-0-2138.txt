No, to their lives ill friends were contrary. KING RICHARD All unavoided is the doom of destinyâ€” QUEEN ELIZABETH True, when avoided grace makes destiny.
My babes were destined to a fairer death,
If grace had blessed thee with a fairer life. KING RICHARD Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise
And dangerous success of bloody wars,
As I intend more good to you and yours
Than ever you or yours by me were harmed.
