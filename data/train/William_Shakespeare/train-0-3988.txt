We’ll none of that. That have I told my love
In glory of my kinsman Hercules. ‘The riot of the tipsy bacchanals
Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage.’ That is an old device, and it was played
When I from Thebes came last a conqueror. ‘The thrice-three muses mourning for the death
Of learning, late deceased in beggary.’
