ALL THE CONSPIRATORS Let him die for’t. ALL THE PEOPLE shouting dispersedly Tear him to pieces! Do it presently!
He killed my son! My daughter! He killed my cousin
Marcus! He killed my father! SECOND LORD Peace, ho! No outrage, peace. The man is noble, and his fame folds in
This orb o’th’ earth. His last offences to us
Shall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,
And trouble not the peace.
