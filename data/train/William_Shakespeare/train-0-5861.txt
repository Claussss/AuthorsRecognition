Doth Fortune play the hussy with me now?
News have I that my Nell is dead
I’th’ spital of a malady of France,
And there my rendezvous is quite cut off.
Old I do wax, and from my weary limbs
Honour is cudgelled. Well, bawd I’ll turn,
And something lean to cutpurse of quick hand.
To England will I steal, and there I’ll steal,
And patches will I get unto these cudgelled scars,
And swear I got them in the Gallia wars.
