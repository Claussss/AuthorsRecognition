Mark how his virtue, like a hidden sun,
Breaks through his baser garments. Heâ€™s well got, sure. THESEUS (to Arcite) What made you seek this place, sir? Noble Theseus, To purchase name and do my ablest service
To such a well-found wonder as thy worth,
For only in thy court of all the world
Dwells fair-eyed honour.
