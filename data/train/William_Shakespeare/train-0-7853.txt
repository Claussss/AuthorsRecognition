MISTRESS OVERDONE But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be pulled down? POMPEY To the ground, mistress. MISTRESS OVERDONE Why, here’s a change indeed in the commonwealth. What shall become of me? POMPEY Come, fear not you. Good counsellors lack no clients. Though you change your place, you need not change your trade. I’ll be your tapster still. Courage, there will be pity taken on you. You that have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you will be considered.
