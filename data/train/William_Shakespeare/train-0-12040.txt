Fear me not. You are now too foul. Farewell.
Get off your trinkets: you shall want naught. PALAMON Sirrah— I’ll hear no more. If he keep touch, he dies for’t. Exit as into the bush 3.4
Enter the Jailer’s Daughter 
JAILER’S DAUGHTER I am very cold, and all the stars are out too,
The little stars and all, that look like agtets—
The sun has seen my folly. Palamon!
Alas, no, he’s in heaven. Where am I now?
Yonder’s the sea and there’s a ship—how’t tumbles!
And there’s a rock lies watching under water—
Now, now, it beats upon it—now, now, now,
There’s a leak sprung, a sound one—how they cry!
Open her before the wind—you’ll lose all else.
Up with a course or two and tack about, boys.
Good night, good night, you’re gone. I am very
hungry.
Would I could find a fine frog—he would tell me
News from all parts o‘th’ world, then would I make
A carrack of a cockle-shell, and sail
By east and north-east to the King of Pygmies,
For he tells fortunes rarely. Now my father,
Twenty to one, is trussed up in a trice
Tomorrow morning. I’ll say never a word.
(She sings)
For I’ll cut my green coat, a foot above my knee,
And I’ll clip my yellow locks, an inch below mine eye,
Hey nonny, nonny, nonny,
He s’buy me a white cut, forth for to ride,
And I’ll go seek him, through the world that is so wide,
Hey nonny, nonny, nonny.
O for a prick now, like a nightingale,
To put my breast against. I shall sleep like a top else.
