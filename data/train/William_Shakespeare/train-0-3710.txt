FRIAR LAURENCE Too familiar Is my dear son with such sour company.
I bring thee tidings of the Prince’s doom. What less than doomsday is the Prince’s doom? FRIAR LAURENCE A gentler judgement vanished from his lips:
Not body’s death, but body’s banishment. Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say ‘death’,
For exile hath more terror in his look,
Much more than death. Do not say ‘banishment’.
