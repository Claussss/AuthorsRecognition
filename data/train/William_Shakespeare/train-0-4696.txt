Rare words I Brave world! (Calling) Hostess, my
breakfast, come!—
O, I could wish this tavern were my drum! Exit 4.1
Enter Hotspur and the Earls of,Worcester and Douglas Well said, my noble Scot ! If speaking truth
In this fine age were not thought flattery,
Such attribution should the Douglas have
As not a soldier of this season’s stamp
Should go so general current through the world.
By God, I cannot flatter, I do defy
The tongues of soothers, but a braver place
In my heart’s love hath no man than yourself.
Nay, task me to my word, approve me, lord.
