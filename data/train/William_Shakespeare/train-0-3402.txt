2.4
Enter the Earl of Salisbury and a Welsh Captain 
WELSH CAPTAIN My lord of Salisbury, we have stayed ten days,
And hardly kept our countrymen together,
And yet we hear no tidings from the King.
Therefore we will disperse ourselves. Farewell. Stay yet another day, thou trusty Welshman.
The King reposeth all his confidence in thee.
