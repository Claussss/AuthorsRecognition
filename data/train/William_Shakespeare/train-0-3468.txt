BOLINGBROKE I thought you had been willing to resign. My crown I am, but still my griefs are mine.
You may my glories and my state depose,
But not my griefs; still am I king of those. BOLINGBROKE Part of your cares you give me with your crown. Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down.
My care is loss of care by old care done;
Your care is gain of care by new care won.
The cares I give I have, though given away;
They â€™tend the crown, yet still with me they stay.
