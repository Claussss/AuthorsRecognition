(To Ferdinand and Miranda) No tongue, all eyes! Be silent. Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas
Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats, and peas;
Thy turfy mountains where live nibbling sheep,
And flat meads thatched with stover, them to keep;
Thy banks with peonied and twill
Which spongy April at thy hest betrims
To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom-groves,
 Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves,
Being lass-lorn; thy pole-clipped vineyard,
And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky-hard,
Where thou thyself dost air: the Queen o’th’ Sky,
Whose wat’ry arch and messenger am I,
Bids thee leave these, and with her sovereign grace
