Speed more than speed but dull and slow she deems;
Extremity still urgeth such extremes. The homely villain curtsies to her low,
And blushing on her with a steadfast eye
Receives the scroll without or yea or no,
And forth with bashful innocence doth hie.
But they whose guilt within their bosoms lie Imagine every eye beholds their blame,
For Lucrece thought he blushed to see her shame,
