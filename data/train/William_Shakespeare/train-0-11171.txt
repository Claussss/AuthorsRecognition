Enter
Innogen The Princess. Good morrow, fairest. Sister, your sweet hand. Good morrow, sir. You lay out too much pains
For purchasing but trouble. The thanks I give
Is telling you that I am poor of thanks,
And scarce can spare them. Still I swear I love you. If you but said so, â€™twere as deep with me.
If you swear still, your recompense is still
That I regard it not.
