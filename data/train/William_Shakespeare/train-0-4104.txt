What say these young ones? What say you, my niece? That she is bound in honour still to do
What you in wisdom shall vouchsafe to say. Speak then, Prince Dauphin, can you love this lady? LOUIS THE DAUPHIN Nay, ask me if I can refrain from love, 526
For I do love her most unfeignedly. Then do I give Volquessen, Touraine, Maine,
Poitou, and Anjou, these five provinces,
With her to thee, and this addition more: 530
Full thirty thousand marks of English coin.
Philip of France, if thou be pleased withal,
Command thy son and daughter to join hands.
