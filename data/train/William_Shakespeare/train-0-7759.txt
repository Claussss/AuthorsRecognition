DOWNES Sir Thomas More, Lord Chancellor of England, I arrest you in the King’s name of high treason. MORE Gramercies, friend. To a great prison, to discharge the strife
Commenced ‘twixt conscience and my frailer life, 185
More now must march. Chelsea, adieu, adieu.
Strange farewell: thou shalt ne’er more see More true,
For I shall ne‘er see thee more.—Servants, farewell.—
Wife, mar not thine indifferent face. Be wise.
More’s widow’s husband, he must make thee rise.—
Daughters, ( ) what’s here, what’s here?
Mine eye had almost parted with a tear.—
Dear son, possess my virtue; that I ne’er gave.
Grave More thus lightly walks to a quick grave.
