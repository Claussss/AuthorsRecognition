O be not moved, Prince Troilus.
Let me be privileged by my place and message
To be a speaker free. When I am hence
I’ll answer to my lust. And know you, lord,
I’ll nothing do on charge. To her own worth
She shall be prized; but that you say ‘Be’t so’,
I’ll speak it in my spirit and honour ‘No!’ Come, to the port.—I’ll tell thee, Diomed,
This brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head.—
Lady, give me your hand, and as we walk
To our own selves bend we our needful talk.
