Pray you, tell him I am his fortune’s vassal, and I send him
The greatness he has got. I hourly learn
A doctrine of obedience, and would gladly
Look him i’th’ face. This I’ll report, dear lady; Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitied
Of him that caused it. Enter Roman soldiers from behind PROCULEIUS (to the soldiers)
