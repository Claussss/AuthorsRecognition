PRINCE HENRY O, that there were some virtue in my tears
That might relieve you! KING JOHN The salt in them is hot. Within me is a hell, and there the poison
Is, as a fiend, confined to tyrannize
On unreprievable condemned blood. Enter the Bastard O, I am scalded with my violent motion
And spleen of speed to see your majesty!
