KING EDWARD Then, Gobin, for the service thou hast done
We here enlarge and give thee liberty,
And for a recompense, beside this good,
Thou shalt receive five hundred marks in gold.
(To Derby) I know not how we should have missed our son,
Whom now in heart I wish I might behold. Enter the Comte dâ€™Artois
