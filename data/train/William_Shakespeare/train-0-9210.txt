What wood is this before us? The wood of Birnam. Let every soldier hew him down a bough
And bear’t before him. Thereby shall we shadow
The numbers of our host, and make discovery
Err in report of us. It shall be done. We learn no other but the confident tyrant
Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure
Our setting down before’t.
