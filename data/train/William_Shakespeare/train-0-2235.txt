She red and hot as coals of glowing fire;
He red for shame, but frosty in desire. The studded bridle on a ragged bough
Nimbly she fastensâ€”O, how quick is love!
The steed is stalled up, and even now
To tie the rider she begins to prove. Backward she pushed him, as she would be thrust,
And governed him in strength, though not in lust.
