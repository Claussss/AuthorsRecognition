But wherefore comes Sir William Montague?
(To Montague) How stands the league between the Scot and us? Cracked and dissevered, my renowned lord.
The treacherous King no sooner was informed
Of your withdrawing of your army back
But straight, forgetting of his former oath,
He made invasion on the bordering towns.
Berwick is won, Newcastle spoiled and lost,
And now the tyrant hath begirt with siege
The Castle of Roxburgh, where, enclosed,
The Countess Salisbury is like to perish.
