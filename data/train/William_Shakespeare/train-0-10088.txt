MARINA (to Pericles) Hail, sir; my lord, lend ear. PERICLES Hmh, ha! He roughly repulses her MARINA I am a maid, My lord, that ne‘er before invited eyes,
But have been gazed on like a comet. She speaks,
My lord, that maybe hath endured a grief
Might equal yours, if both were justly weighed.
Though wayward fortune did malign my state,
My derivation was from ancestors
Who stood equivalent with mighty kings,
But time hath rooted out my parentage,
And to the world and awkward casualties
Bound me in servitude. (Aside) I will desist.
But there is something glows upon my cheek,
And whispers in mine ear ‘Stay till he speak.’
