A ROMAN CAPTAIN The senate hath stirred up the confiners
And gentlemen of Italy, most willing spirits
That promise noble service, and they come
Under the conduct of bold Giacomo,
Siena’s brother. When expect you them? A ROMAN CAPTAIN With the next benefit o’th’ wind. This forwardness Makes our hopes fair. Command our present numbers
Be mustered; bid the captains look to’t.
