Enter Paris, Aeneas, Antenor, Deiphobus, and Diomedes Fear not my truth. The moral of my wit
Is ‘plain and true!’; there’s all the reach of it.—
Welcome, Sir Diomed. Here is the lady
Which for Antenor we deliver you.
At the port, lord, I’ll give her to thy hand,
And by the way possess thee what she is.
Entreat her fair, and by my soul, fair Greek,
If e’er thou stand at mercy of my sword,
Name Cressid, and thy life shall be as safe
As Priam is in Ilium.
