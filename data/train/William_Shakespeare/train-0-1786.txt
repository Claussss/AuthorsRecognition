 Enter Aemilius, a messenger What news with thee, Aemilius? Arm, my lords! Rome never had more cause.
The Goths have gathered head, and with a power
Of high-resolv
They hither march amain under conduct
Of Lucius, son to old Andronicus,
Who threats in course of this revenge to do
As much as ever Coriolanus did.
