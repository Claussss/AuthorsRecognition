Why, yet there want not many that do fear
In deep of night to walk by this Herne’s Oak.
But what of this? MISTRESS FORD Marry, this is our device: That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us,
Disguised like Herne, with huge horns on his head. Well, let it not be doubted but he’ll come,
And in this shape. When you have brought him
thither
What shall be done with him? What is your plot?
