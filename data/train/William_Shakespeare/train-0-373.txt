Enter Silvia Gentlewoman, good day. I pray you be my mean
To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia. What would you with her, if that I be she? If you be she, I do entreat your patience
To hear me speak the message I am sent on. From my master, Sir Proteus, madam. SILVIA O, he sends you for a picture?
