God for his pity help these troublous times!
The streetâ€™s stopped up with gazing multitudes.
Command our armed officers with halberds
Make way for entrance of the prisoners.
Let proclamation once again be made
That every householder, on pain of death,
Keep in his prentices, and every man
Stand with a weapon ready at his door,
As he will answer to the contrary.
