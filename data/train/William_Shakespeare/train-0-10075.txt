BOULT What would you have me do? Go to the wars, would you, where a man may serve seven years for the loss of a leg, and have not money enough in the end to buy him a wooden one? Do anything but this thou dost. Empty
Old receptacles or common sew’rs of filth,
Serve by indenture to the public hangman—
Any of these are yet better than this.
For what thou professest a baboon, could he speak,
Would own a name too dear. Here’s gold for thee.
If that thy master would make gain by me,
Proclaim that I can sing, weave, sew, and dance,
With other virtues which I’ll keep from boast,
And I will undertake all these to teach.
I doubt not but this populous city will
Yield many scholars.
