O, yet I do repent me of my fury
That I did kill them. Wherefore did you so? Who can be wise, amazed, temp‘rate and furious,
Loyal and neutral in a moment? No man.
Th’expedition of my violent love
Outran the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan,
His silver skin laced with his golden blood,
And his gashed stabs looked like a breach in nature
For ruin’s wasteful entrance; there the murderers,
Steeped in the colours of their trade, their daggers
Unmannerly breeched with gore. Who could refrain,
That had a heart to love, and in that heart
Courage to make ’s love known?
