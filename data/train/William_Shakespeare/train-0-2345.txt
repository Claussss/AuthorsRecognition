For he being dead, with him is beauty slain,
And beauty dead, black chaos comes again. ‘Fie, fie, fond love, thou art as full of fear
As one with treasure laden, hemmed with thieves.
Trifles unwitness
Thy coward heart with false bethinking grieves.’ Even at this word she hears a merry horn,
Whereat she leaps, that was but late forlorn.
