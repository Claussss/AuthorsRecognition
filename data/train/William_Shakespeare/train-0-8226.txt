OTHELLO Now, by heaven, My blood begins my safer guides to rule,
And passion, having my best judgement collied,
Essays to lead the way. ‘Swounds, if I stir,
Or do but lift this arm, the best of you
Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know
How this foul rout began, who set it on,
And he that is approved in this offence,
Though he had twinned with me, both at a birth,
Shall lose me. What, in a town of war
Yet wild, the people’s hearts brimful of fear,
To manage private and domestic quarrel
In night, and on the court and guard of safety!
’Tis monstrous. Iago, who began’t?
