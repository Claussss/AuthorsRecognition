TROILUS (aside) Sweet sir, you honour me. HECTOR (to Diomedes) And so good night. ACHILLES Come, come, enter my tent. Exeunt Diomedes, followed by Ulysses and
 Troilus, at one door; and Achilles, Hector,
 Ajax, and Nestor at another door THERSITES That same Diomed’s a false-hearted rogue, a most unjust knave. I will no more trust him when he leers than I will a serpent when he hisses. He will spend his mouth and promise like Brabbler the hound, but when he performs astronomers foretell it: that is prodigious, there will come some change. The sun borrows of the moon when Diomed keeps his word. I will rather leave to see Hector than not to dog him. They say he keeps a Trojan drab, and uses the traitor Calchas his tent. I’ll after.—Nothing but lechery! All incontinent varlets! Exit
