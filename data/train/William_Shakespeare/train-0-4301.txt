Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow
By taking nor by giving of excess,
Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend
I’ll break a custom. (To
Bassanio) Is he yet possessed
How much ye would? SHYLOCK Ay, ay, three thousand ducats. ANTONIO And for three months. I had forgot—three months. (To Bassanio) You told me
so.—
Well then, your bond; and let me see—but hear you,
Methoughts you said you neither lend nor borrow
Upon advantage.
