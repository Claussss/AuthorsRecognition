CORDELIA And so I am. Be your tears wet? Yes, faith. I pray, weep not.
If you have poison for me, I will drink it.
I know you do not love me; for your sisters
Have, as I do remember, done me wrong.
You have some cause; they have not. CORDELIA No cause, no cause. LEAR Am I in France? KENT In your own kingdom, sir.
