First, it was usual with him, every day
It would infect his speech, that if the King
Should without issue die, he’ll carry it so
To make the sceptre his. These very words
I’ve heard him utter to his son-in-law,
Lord Abergavenny, to whom by oath he menaced
Revenge upon the Cardinal. CARDINAL WOLSEY (to the King)
