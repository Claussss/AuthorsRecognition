He writes in his tables Such and such pictures, there the window, such
Th‘adornment of her bed, the arras, figures,
Why, such and such; and the contents o’th’ story.
Ah, but some natural notes about her body
Above ten thousand meaner movables
Would testify t’enrich mine inventory.
O sleep, thou ape of death, lie dull upon her,
And be her sense but as a monument
Thus in a chapel lying. Come off, come off;
As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard.
