Who hath he left behind him general? KENT Did your letters pierce the Queen to any demonstration of grief? II Ay, sir. She took them, read them in my presence,
And now and then an ample tear trilled down
Her delicate cheek. It seemed she was a queen
Over her passion who, most rebel-like,
Sought to be king oâ€™er her.
