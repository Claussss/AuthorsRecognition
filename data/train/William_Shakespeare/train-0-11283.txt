Exit with Cloten’s head I fear ’twill be revenged. Would, Polydore, thou hadst not done’t, though
valour
Becomes thee well enough. Would I had done’t, So the revenge alone pursued me. Polydore,
I love thee brotherly, but envy much
Thou hast robbed me of this deed. I would revenges
That possible strength might meet would seek us
through
And put us to our answer.
