O, my poor father! The heaven sets spies upon us, will not have
Our contract celebrated. You are married? We are not, sir, nor are we like to be.
The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first.
The odds for high and low’s alike. Is this the daughter of a king? When once she is my wife. That ‘once’, I see, by your good father’s speed
Will come on very slowly. I am sorry,
Most sorry, you have broken from his liking
Where you were tied in duty; and as sorry
Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,
That you might well enjoy her.
