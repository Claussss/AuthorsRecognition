O, let me kiss that hand! LEAR Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality. O ruined piece of nature! This great world
Shall so wear out to naught. Dost thou know me? LEAR I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny at me? No, do thy worst, blind Cupid, Iâ€™ll not love.
Read thou this challenge. Mark but the penning of it.
