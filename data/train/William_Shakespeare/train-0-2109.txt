KING RICHARD Richmond? When last I was at Exeter,
The Mayor in courtesy showed me the castle,
And called it ‘Ruge-mount’—at which name I started,
Because a bard of Ireland told me once
I should not live long after I saw ‘Richmond’. BUCKINGHAM My lord? KING RICHARD Ay? What’s o’clock? I am thus bold to put your grace in mind
Of what you promised me.
