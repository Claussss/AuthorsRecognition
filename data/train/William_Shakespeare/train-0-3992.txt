THESEUS I will hear that play; For never anything can be amiss
When simpleness and duty tender it.
Go, bring them in; and take your places, ladies.
Exit Egeus I love not to see wretchedness oâ€™ercharged,
And duty in his service perishing. Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing. He says they can do nothing in this kind.
