Never believe it.
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
Here’s yet some liquor left. HAMLET As thou’rt a man, Give me the cup. Let go. By heaven, I’ll ha’t.
O God, Horatio, what a wounded name,
Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
Absent thee from felicity a while,
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain
To tell my story.
