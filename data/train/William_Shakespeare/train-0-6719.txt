FORTINBRAS Let us haste to hear it, And call the noblest to the audience.
For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,
Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me. Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.
But let this same be presently performed,
Even whiles menâ€™s minds are wild, lest more
mischance
On plots and errors happen.
