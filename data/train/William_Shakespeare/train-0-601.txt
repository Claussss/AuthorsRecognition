Among them know you one Vincentio? I know him not, but I have heard of him,
A merchant of incomparable wealth. He is my father, sir, and sooth to say,
In countâ€™nance somewhat doth resemble you. BIONDELLO (aside) As much as an apple doth an oyster, and all one. To save your life in this extremity
This favour will I do you for his sake,
And think it not the worst of all your fortunes
That you are like to Sir Vincentio.
His name and credit shall you undertake,
And in my house you shall be friendly lodged.
Look that you take upon you as you should.
You understand me, sir? So shall you stay
Till you have done your business in the city.
If this be courtesy, sir, accept of it.
