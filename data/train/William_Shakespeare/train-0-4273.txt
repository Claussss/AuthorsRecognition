SALERIO Good morrow, my good lords. 65 Good signors both, when shall we laugh? Say, when?
You grow exceeding strange. Must it be so? Weâ€™ll make our leisures to attend on yours. Exeunt Salerio and Solanio My lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,
We two will leave you; but at dinner-time
I pray you have in mind where we must meet.
