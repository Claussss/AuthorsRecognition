Flourish. Enter on the walls Joan la Pucelle, Charles the Dauphin, Ren with colours Advance our waving colours on the walls;
Rescued is Orl
Thus Joan la Pucelle hath performed her word. Divinest creature, Astraea’s daughter,
How shall I honour thee for this success?
Thy promises are like Adonis’ garden,
That one day bloomed and fruitful were the next.
France, triumph in thy glorious prophetess!
Recovered is the town of Orl
More blessed hap did ne’er befall our state.
