FIRST SERVINGMAN Say thou wilt course, thy greyhounds are as swift
As breathed stags, ay, fleeter than the roe. SECOND SERVINGMAN Dost thou love pictures? We will fetch thee straight
Adonis painted by a running brook,
And Cytherea all in sedges hid,
Which seem to move and wanton with her breath
Even as the waving sedges play wi’th’ wind.
