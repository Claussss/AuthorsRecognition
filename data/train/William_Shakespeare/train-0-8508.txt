LEAR Dost thou call me fool, boy? FOOL All thy other titles thou hast given away. That thou wast born with. KENT (to Lear) This is not altogether fool, my lord. FOOL No, faith; lords and great men will not let me. If I had a monopoly out, they would have part on’t, and ladies too, they will not let me have all the fool to myself—they’ll be snatching. Give me an egg, nuncle, and I’ll give thee two crowns.
