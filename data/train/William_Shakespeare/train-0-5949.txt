Sir, ’tis your brother Cassius at the door,
Who doth desire to see you. Is he alone? No, sir, there are more with him. BRUTUS Do you know them? No, sir; their hats are plucked about their ears,
And half their faces buried in their cloaks,
That by no means I may discover them
By any mark of favour. BRUTUS Let ’em enter. Exit Lucius
