CRESSIDA What was his cause of anger? The noise goes this: there is among the Greeks
A lord of Trojan blood, nephew to Hector;
They call him Ajax. CRESSIDA Good, and what of him? They say he is a very man per se,
And stands alone. CRESSIDA So do all men Unless they are drunk, sick, or have no legs. ALEXANDER This man, lady, hath robbed many beasts of their particular additions: he is as valiant as the lion, churlish as the bear, slow as the elephantâ€”a man into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his valour is crushed into folly, his folly farced with discretion. There is no man hath a virtue that he hath not a glimpse of, nor any man an attaint but he carries some stain of it. He is melancholy without cause and merry against the hair; he hath the joints of everything, but everything so out of joint that he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and no use, or purblind Argus, all eyes and no sight.
