What shall we do there, wench? JAILER’S DAUGHTER Why, play at stool-ball—
 What is there else to do? WOOER I am content If we shall keep our wedding there. JAILER’S DAUGHTER ’Tis true—
 For there, I will assure you, we shall find
Some blind priest for the purpose that will venture
To marry us, for here they are nice, and foolish.
Besides, my father must be hanged tomorrow,
And that would be a blot i’th’ business.
Are not you Palamon?
