Enter a Messenger MESSENGER My lord, here are letters for you. HOTSPUR I cannot read them now. [Exit Messenger] O gentlemen, the time of life is short. To spend that shortness basely were too long
If life did ride upon a dialâ€™s point,
Still ending at the arrival of an hour.
An if we live, we live to tread on kings;
If die, brave death when princes die with us!
Now for our consciences: the arms are fair
When the intent of bearing them is just.
