She throws her eyes about the painting round,
And who she finds forlorn she doth lament.
At last she sees a wretched image bound,
That piteous looks to Phrygian shepherds lent.
His face, though full of cares, yet showed content. Onward to Troy with the blunt swains he goes,
So mild that patience seemed to scorn his woes.
