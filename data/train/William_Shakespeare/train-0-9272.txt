But that your royalty Holds idleness your subject, I should take you
For idleness itself. â€™Tis sweating labour To bear such idleness so near the heart
As Cleopatra this. But sir, forgive me,
Since my becomings kill me when they do not
Eye well to you. Your honour calls you hence,
Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly,
And all the gods go with you. Upon your sword
Sit laurel victory, and smooth success
Be strewed before your feet.
