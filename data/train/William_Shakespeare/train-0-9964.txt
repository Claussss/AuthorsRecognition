ALL kneeling By honour’s cause, forbear your suffrages.
If that you love Prince Pericles, forbear. The lords rise Take I your wish I leap into the seas
Where’s hourly trouble for a minute’s ease,
But if I cannot win you to this love,
A twelvemonth longer then let me entreat you
Further to bear the absence of your king;
If in which time expired he not return,
I shall with aged patience bear your yoke.
Go, seek your noble prince like noble subjects,
And in your search spend your adventurous worth,
Whom if you find and win unto return,
You shall like diamonds sit about his crown.
