APEMANTUS What a coil’s here, Serving of becks and jutting-out of bums!
I doubt whether their legs be worth the sums
That are given for ’em. Friendship’s full of dregs.
Methinks false hearts should never have sound legs.
Thus honest fools lay out their wealth on curtseys. Now, Apemantus, if thou wert not sullen
I would be good to thee.
