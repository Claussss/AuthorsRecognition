Exeunt Lucio and gentlemen at one door;
 Claudio, Juliet, Provost, and officers at another 1.3
Enter the Duke and a Friar No, holy father, throw away that thought.
Believe not that the dribbling dart of love
Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee
To give me secret harbour hath a purpose
More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
Of burning youth.
