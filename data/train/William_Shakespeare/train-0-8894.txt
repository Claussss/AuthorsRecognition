SECOND SENATOR You breathe in vain. ALCIBIADES In vain? His service done at Lacedaemon and Byzantium
Were a sufficient briber for his life. FIRST SENATOR What’s that? ALCIBIADES Why, I say, my lords, he’s done fair service, And slain in fight many of your enemies.
How full of valour did he bear himself
In the last conflict, and made plenteous wounds!
