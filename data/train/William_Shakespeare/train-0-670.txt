I hope, better. Sirrah Biondello, Go and entreat my wife to come to me forthwith. Exit Biondello O ho, ‘entreat’ her—nay, then she must needs come. I am afraid, sir, do what you can, Enter Biondello Yours will not be entreated. Now, where’s my wife? She says you have some goodly jest in hand.
She will not come. She bids you come to her.
