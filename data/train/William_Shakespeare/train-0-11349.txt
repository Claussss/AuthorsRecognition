I never saw Such noble fury in so poor a thing,
Such precious deeds in one that promised naught
But beggary and poor looks. No tidings of him? He hath been searched among the dead and living,
But no trace of him. To my grief I am The heir of his reward, which I will add
(To Belarius, Guiderius, and Arviragus)
To you, the liver, heart, and brain of Britain,
By whom I grant she lives. â€™Tis now the time
To ask of whence you are. Report it.
