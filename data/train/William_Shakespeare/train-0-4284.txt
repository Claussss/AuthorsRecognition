PORTIA Good sentences, and well pronounced. NERISSA They would be better if well followed. PORTIA If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been churches, and poor men’s cottages princes’ palaces. It is a good divine that follows his own instructions.

Such a hare is madness, the youth, to skip o’er the meshes of good counsel, the cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband.

Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?
