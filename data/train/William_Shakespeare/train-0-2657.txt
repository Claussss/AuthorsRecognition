EARL OF WARWICK Far be it from the honour of my age
That I should owe bright gold and render lead.
Age is a cynic, not a flatterer.
I say again that if I knew your grief,
And that by me it may be lessened,
My proper harm should buy your highness’ good. KING EDWARD These are the vulgar tenders of false men
That never pay the duty of their words.
Thou wilt not stick to swear what thou hast said,
But when thou know’st my griefs condition
This rash disgorged vomit of thy word
Thou wilt eat up again, and leave me helpless.
