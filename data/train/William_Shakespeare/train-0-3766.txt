CAPULET to the Nurse Send for the County; go tell him of this.
I’ll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning. I met the youthful lord at Laurence’ cell,
And gave him what becoming love I might,
Not stepping o’er the bounds of modesty. Why, I am glad on’t. This is well. Stand up. Juliet rises  This is as’t should be. Let me see the County.
To Nurse
Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar,
All our whole city is much bound to him.
