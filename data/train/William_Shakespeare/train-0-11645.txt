BUCKINGHAM to Norfolk Lo you, my lord, The net has fall’n upon me. I shall perish
Under device and practice. To see you ta’en from liberty to look on
The business present. ’Tis his highness’ pleasure
You shall to th’ Tower. It will help me nothing To plead mine innocence, for that dye is on me
Which makes my whit’st part black. The will of
heav’n
Be done in this and all things. I obey.
O, my lord Abergavenny, fare you well.
