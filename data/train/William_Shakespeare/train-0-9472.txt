Who’s gone this morning? Who? One ever near thee. Call for Enobarbus,
He shall not hear thee, or from Caesar’s camp
Say ‘I am none of thine’. What sayest thou? Sir, he is with Caesar. EROS (to Antony) Sir, his chests and treasure He has not with him. Is he gone? Most certain. Go, Eros, send his treasure after. Do it.
Detain no jot, I charge thee. Write to him—
I will subscribe—gentle adieus and greetings.
Say that I wish he never find more cause 15
To change a master. O, my fortunes have
Corrupted honest men! Dispatch. Enobarbus!
