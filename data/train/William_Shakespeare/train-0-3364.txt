KING RICHARD Think what you will, we seize into our hands
His plate, his goods, his money, and his lands. I’ll not be by the while. My liege, farewell.
What will ensue hereof there’s none can tell.
But by bad courses may be understood
That their events can never fall out good. KING RICHARD Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wiltshire straight.
Bid him repair to us to Ely House
To see this business. Tomorrow next
We will for Ireland, and ’tis time, I trow.
And we create, in absence of ourself,
Our uncle York Lord Governor of England;
For he is just and always loved us well.—
Come on, our Queen; tomorrow must we part.
Be merry, for our time of stay is short.
