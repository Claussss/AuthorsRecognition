MASTER GUNNER Sirrah, thou know
And how the English have the suburbs won. Father, I know, and oft have shot at them;
Howe’er, unfortunate, I missed my aim. MASTER GUNNER But now thou shalt not. Be thou ruled by me.
Chief Master Gunner am I of this town;
Something I must do to procure me grace.
The Prince’s spials have informed me
How the English, in the suburbs close entrenched,
Wont, through a secret grate of iron bars
In yonder tower, to overpeer the city,
And thence discover how with most advantage
They may vex us with shot or with assault.
To intercept this inconvenience,
A piece of ordnance ‘gainst it I have placed,
And even these three days have I watched, if I could
see them.
Now do thou watch, for I can stay no longer.
If thou spy’st any, run and bring me word,
And thou shalt find me at the governor’s.
