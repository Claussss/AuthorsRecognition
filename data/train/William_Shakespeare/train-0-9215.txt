Enter a Messenger Thou com’st to use Thy tongue: thy story quickly. Gracious my lord, I should report that which I say I saw,
But know not how to do’t. Well, say, sir. As I did stand my watch upon the hill
I looked toward Birnam, and anon methought
The wood began to move. Liar and slave! Let me endure your wrath if’t be not so.
Within this three mile may you see it coming.
I say, a moving grove.
