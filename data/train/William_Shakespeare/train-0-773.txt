SIMPCOX’S WIFE Ay, indeed, was he. SUFFOLK What woman is this? SIMPCOX’S WIFE His wife, an’t like your worship. GLOUCESTER Hadst thou been his mother Thou couldst have better told. KING HENRY (to Simpcox) Where wert thou born? At Berwick, in the north, an’t like your grace. Poor soul, God’s goodness hath been great to thee.

But still remember what the Lord hath done.
