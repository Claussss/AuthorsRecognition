ROMEO I thought all for the best. Help me into some house, Benvolio,
Or I shall faint. A plague o’ both your houses.
They have made worms’ meat of me.
I have it, and soundly, too. Your houses! Exeunt all but Romeo This gentleman, the Prince’s near ally,
My very friend, hath got this mortal hurt
In my behalf, my reputation stained
With Tybalt’s slander—Tybalt, that an hour
Hath been my cousin! O sweet Juliet,
Thy beauty hath made me effeminate,
And in my temper softened valour’s steel.
