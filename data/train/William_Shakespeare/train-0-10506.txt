Be it forbid, my lord. To bide upon’t: thou art not honest; or
If thou inclin‘st that way, thou art a coward,
Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining
From course required. Or else thou must be counted
A servant grafted in my serious trust
And therein negligent, or else a fool
That seest a game played home, the rich stake drawn,
And tak’st it all for jest.
