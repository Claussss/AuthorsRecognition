BUCKINGHAM We wait upon your grace. Exeunt 2.2
Enter the old Duchess of York with the two children of Clarence Good grannam, tell us, is our father dead? DUCHESS OF YORK No, boy. Why do you weep so oft, and beat your breast,
And cry,  Why do you look on us and shake your head,
And call us orphans, wretches, castaways,
If that our noble father were alive?
