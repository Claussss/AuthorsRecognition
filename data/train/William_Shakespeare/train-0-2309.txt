Then do they spend their mouths. Echo replies,
As if another chase were in the skies. ‘By this, poor Wat, far off upon a hill,
Stands on his hinder legs with list’ning ear,
To hearken if his foes pursue him still.
Anon their loud alarums he doth hear, And now his grief may be compared well
To one sore sick that hears the passing-bell.
