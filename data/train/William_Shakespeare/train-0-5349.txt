SHALLOW Honest gentleman, I know not your breeding. PISTOL Why then, lament therefor. SHALLOW Give me pardon, sir. If, sir, you come with news from the court, I take it thereâ€™s but two ways: either to utter them, or conceal them. I am, sir, under the King in some authority. Under which king, besonian? Speak, or die.
