QUEEN ELIZABETH But I hear, no. They say my son of York
Has almost overta’en him in his growth. Ay, mother, but I would not have it so. DUCHESS OF YORK Why, my young cousin, it is good to grow. Grandam, one night as we did sit at supper,
My uncle Rivers talked how I did grow
More than my brother. ‘Ay’, quoth my nuncle
Gloucester,
‘Small herbs have grace; gross weeds do grow apace’.
And since, methinks I would not grow so fast,
Because sweet flow’rs are slow, and weeds make
haste.
