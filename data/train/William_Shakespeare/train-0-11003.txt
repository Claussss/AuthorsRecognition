O, here he is. Lay hand upon him. To Lear
Your most dear daughter— No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even
The natural fool of fortune. Use me well.
You shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons;
I am cut to th’ brains. LEAR No seconds? All myself? Why, this would make a man a man of salt,
To use his eyes for garden water-pots.
I will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom. What,
I will be jovial. Come, come, I am a king.
Masters, know you that?
