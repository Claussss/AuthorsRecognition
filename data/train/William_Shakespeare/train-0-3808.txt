I do defy thy conjuration,
And apprehend thee for a felon here. ROMEO (drawing) Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy. 70 O Lord, they fight! I I will go call the watch. Exit O, I am slain
Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet. In faith, I will. Paris dies Let me peruse this face.
Mercutio’s kinsman, noble County Paris! 75
What said my man when my betoss
Did not attend him as we rode? I think
He told me Paris should have married Juliet.
Said he not so? Or did I dream it so?
Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet, 80
To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
One writ with me in sour misfortune’s book.
I’ll bury thee in a triumphant grave.
