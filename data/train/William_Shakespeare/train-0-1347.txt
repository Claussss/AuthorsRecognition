GLOUCESTER (to the Messenger) Is Paris lost? Is Rouen yielded up?
If Henry were recalled to life again,

Amongst the soldiers this is mutter
That here you maintain several factions,
And whilst a field should be dispatched and fought,
You are disputing of your generals.
One would have lingâ€™ring wars, with little cost;

By guileful fair words peace may be obtained.

Let not sloth dim your honours new-begot.
Cropped are the flower-de-luces in your arms;
