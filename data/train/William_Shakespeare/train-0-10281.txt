Harp on that still—but by our putting on;
And presently when you have drawn your number,
Repair to th’ Capitol. Repent in their election. Exeunt Citizens BRUTUS Let them go on. This mutiny were better put in hazard
Than stay, past doubt, for greater.
If, as his nature is, he fall in rage
With their refusal, both observe and answer
The vantage of his anger.
