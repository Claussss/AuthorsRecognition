Exeunt Cymbeline and Lords I heard no letter from my master since
I wrote him Innogen was slain. ‘Tis strange.
Nor hear I from my mistress, who did promise
To yield me often tidings. Neither know I
What is betid to Cloten, but remain
Perplexed in all. The heavens still must work.
Wherein I am false I am honest; not true, to be true.
These present wars shall find I love my country
Even to the note o’th’ King, or I’ll fall in them.
All other doubts, by time let them be cleared:
Fortune brings in some boats that are not steered.
