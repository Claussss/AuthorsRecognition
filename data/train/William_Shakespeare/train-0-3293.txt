JOHN OF GAUNT I have, my liege. KING RICHARD
Tell me moreover, hast thou sounded him
If he appeal the Duke on ancient malice
Or worthily, as a good subject should,
On some known ground of treachery in him? JOHN OF GAUNT As near as I could sift him on that argument,
On some apparent danger seen in him
Aimed at your highness, no inveterate malice.
