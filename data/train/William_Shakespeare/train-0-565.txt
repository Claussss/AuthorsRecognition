GRUMIO Ay, sir, they be ready. The oats have eaten the horses. Nay, then, do what thou canst, I will not go today,
No, nor tomorrow—not till I please myself.
The door is open, sir, there lies your way.
You may be jogging whiles your boots are green.
For me, I’ll not be gone till I please myself.
’Tis like you’ll prove a jolly, surly groom,
That take it on you at the first so roundly.
