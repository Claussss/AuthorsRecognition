Why look you strange on me? You know me well. ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS I never saw you in my life till now. O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last,
And careful hours with timeâ€™s deformed hand
Have written strange defeatures in my face.
But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice? ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Neither.
