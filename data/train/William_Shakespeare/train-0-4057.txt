Good leave, good Philip. BASTARD Philip Sparrow, James! There’s toys abroad; anon I’ll tell thee more.
Exit James Gurney
Madam, I was not old Sir Robert’s son.
Sir Robert might have eat his part in me
Upon Good Friday, and ne’er broke his fast. 235
Sir Robert could do well, marry to confess,
Could a get me! Sir Robert could not do it:
We know his handiwork. Therefore, good mother,
To whom am I beholden for these limbs?
Sir Robert never holp to make this leg. 240
