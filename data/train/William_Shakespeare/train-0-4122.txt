That I have room with Rome to curse awhile.
Good Father Cardinal, cry thou ’Amen’
To my keen curses, for without my wrong
There is no tongue hath power to curse him right. There’s law and warrant, lady, for my curse. 110 And for mine too. When law can do no right,
Let it be lawful that law bar no wrong.
Law cannot give my child his kingdom here,
For he that holds his kingdom holds the law.
Therefore, since law itself is perfect wrong,
How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?
