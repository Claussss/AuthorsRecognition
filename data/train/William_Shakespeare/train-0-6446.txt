My hour is almost come
When I to sulph’rous and tormenting flames
Must render up myself. Alas, poor ghost! Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
To what I shall unfold. So art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear. HAMLET What? GHOST I am thy father’s spirit, Doomed for a certain term to walk the night,
And for the day confined to fast in fires
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid
To tell the secrets of my prison-house
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
Make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres,
Thy knotty and combined locks to part,
And each particular hair to stand on end
Like quills upon the fretful porcupine.
But this eternal blazon must not be
To ears of flesh and blood. List, Hamlet, list, O list!
If thou didst ever thy dear father love—
