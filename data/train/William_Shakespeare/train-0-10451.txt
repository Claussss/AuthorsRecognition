AUFIDIUS (aside) I am glad thou hast set thy mercy and thy honour
At difference in thee. Out of that Iâ€™ll work
Myself a former fortune. CORIOLANUS (to Volumnia and Virgilia) Ay, by and by. But we will drink together, and you shall bear
A better witness back than words, which we
On like conditions will have counter-sealed.
Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve
To have a temple built you. All the swords
In Italy, and her confederate arms,
Could not have made this peace.
