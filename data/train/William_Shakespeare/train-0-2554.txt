This picture she advisedly perused,
And chid the painter for his wondrous skill,
Saying some shape in Sinon’s was abused,
So fair a form lodged not a mind so ill;
And still on him she gazed, and gazing still, Such signs of truth in his plain face she spied
That she concludes the picture was belied. ‘It cannot be,’ quoth she, ‘that so much guile’—
She would have said ‘can lurk in such a look’,
But Tarquin’s shape came in her mind the while,
And from her tongue ‘can lurk’ from ‘cannot’ took.
‘It cannot be’ she in that sense forsook,
