The soldiers withdraw The Queen this day here holds her Parliament,
But little thinks we shall be of her council;
By words or blows here let us win our right. Armed as we are, let’s stay within this house. ‘The Bloody Parliament’ shall this be called,
Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be king,
And bashful Henry deposed, whose cowardice
Hath made us bywords to our enemies.
