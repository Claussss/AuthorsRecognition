RICHARD GLOUCESTER Sweet saint, for charity be not so cursed. Foul devil, for God’s sake hence and trouble us not,
For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,
Filled it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.
If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,
Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.—
O gentlemen, see, see! Dead Henry’s wounds
Ope their congealed mouths and bleed afresh.—
Blush, blush, thou lump of foul deformity,
For ‘tis thy presence that ex-hales this blood
From cold and empty veins where no blood dwells.
Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,
Provokes this deluge supernatural.
O God, which this blood mad’st, revenge his death.
O earth, which this blood drink‘st, revenge his death.
Either heav’n with lightning strike the murd’rer dead,
Or earth gape open wide and eat him quick
As thou dost swallow up this good king’s blood,
Which his hell-governed arm hath butchered.
