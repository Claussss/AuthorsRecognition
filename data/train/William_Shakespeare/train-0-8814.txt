Enter one as Cupid Hail to thee, worthy Timon, and to all
That of his bounties taste! The five best senses
Acknowledge thee their patron, and come freely
To gratulate thy plenteous bosom. Th’ear,
Taste, touch, smell, all, pleased from thy table rise.
They only now come but to feast thine eyes. They’re welcome all. Let ’em have kind admittance.
Music make their welcome! Exit Cupid
