LOUIS THE DAUPHIN There end thy brave, and turn thy face in peace.
We grant thou canst outscold us. Fare thee well: 160
We hold our time too precious to be spent
With such a brabbler. PANDOLF Give me leave to speak. No, I will speak. LouisTHE DAUPHIN We will attend to neither.â€” Strike up the drums, and let the tongue of war
Plead for our interest and our being here.
