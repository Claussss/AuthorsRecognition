FALCONBRIDGE And once dispatched him in an embassy
To Germany, there with the Emperor
To treat of high affairs touching that time.
Th‘advantage of his absence took the King,
And in the meantime sojourned at my father’s,
Where how he did prevail I shame to speak.
But truth is truth:large lengths of seas and shores
Between my father and my mother lay, 106
As I have heard my father speak himself,
When this same lusty gentleman was got.
Upon his deathbed he by will bequeathed
His lands to me, and took it on his death 110
That this my mother’s son was none of his;
And if he were, he came into the world
Full fourteen weeks before the course of time.
Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,
My father’s land, as was my father’s will. 115
