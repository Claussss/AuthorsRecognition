I must not hear thee. Fare thee well, kind maid.
Thy pains, not used, must by thyself be paid:
Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward. Inspired merit so by breath is barred.
It is not so with him that all things knows
As â€™tis with us that square our guess by shows;
But most it is presumption in us when
The help of heaven we count the act of men.
Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent.
Of heaven, not me, make an experiment.
I am not an impostor, that proclaim
Myself against the level of mine aim,
But know I think, and think I know most sure,
My art is not past power, nor you past cure.
