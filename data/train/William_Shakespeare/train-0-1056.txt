Exit with his soldiers NORTHUMBERLAND (to King Henry) Be thou a prey unto the house of York,
And die in bands for this unmanly deed. Exit with his soldiers CLIFFORD (to King Henry) In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome,
Or live in peace, abandoned and despised. Exit with his soldiers WARWICK (to King Henry)
