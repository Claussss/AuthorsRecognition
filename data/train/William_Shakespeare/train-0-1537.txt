Thy fatherâ€™s charge shall clear thee from that stain. You cannot witness for me, being slain.
If death be so apparent, then both fly. And leave my followers here to fight and die?
My age was never tainted with such shame. And shall my youth be guilty of such blame?
No more can I be severed from your side
Than can yourself your self in twain divide.
Stay, go, do what you will: the like do I,
For live I will not if my father die.
