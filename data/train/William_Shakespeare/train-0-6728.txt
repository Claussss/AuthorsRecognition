So envious slander,
Whose whisper o’er the world’s diameter,
As level as the cannon to his blank,
Transports his poisoned shot, may miss our name
And hit the woundless air. J. Q2 has this more expansive version of the ending of 4.4:
CAPTAIN I will do’t, my lord. Go softly on. Exit with his army Enter Prince Hamlet, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, etc.
