QUEEN MARGARET (aside) Hover about her, say that right for right
Hath dimmed your infant morn to aged night. DUCHESS OF YORK So many miseries have crazed my voice
That my woe-wearied tongue is still and mute.
Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead? QUEEN MARGARET (aside) Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet;
Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
