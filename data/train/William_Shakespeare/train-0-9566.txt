FIRST GUARD A simple countryman that brought her figs.
This was his basket. Poisoned, then. FIRST GUARD This Charmian lived but now; she stood and spake.
I found her trimming up the diadem
On her dead mistress; tremblingly she stood,
And on the sudden dropped. O, noble weakness! If they had swallowed poison, â€™twould appear
By external swelling; but she looks like sleep,
As she would catch another Antony
In her strong toil of grace.
