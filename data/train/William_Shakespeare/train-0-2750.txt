KING EDWARD A charitable deed, no doubt, and worthy praise!
But how do you imagine, then, to speed?
We are your enemies: in such a case
We can no less but put ye to the sword,
Since, when we proffered truce, it was refused. An if your grace no otherwise vouchsafe,
As welcome death is unto us as life.
