KING EDWARD Now welcome more, and ten times more beloved,
Than if thou never hadst deserved our hate. RICHARD OF GLOUCESTER (to George) Welcome, good Clarence—this is brother-like. WARWICK (to George) O, passing traitor—perjured and unjust! KING EDWARD What, Warwick, wilt thou leave the town and fight?
Or shall we beat the stones about thine ears?
