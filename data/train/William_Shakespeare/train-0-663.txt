Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,
Measures my husband’s sorrow by his woe.
And now you know my meaning. A very mean meaning. Right, I mean you. And I am mean indeed respecting you. PETRUCCIO To her, Kate! HORTENSIO To her, widow! A hundred marks my Kate does put her down. HORTENSIO That’s my office.
