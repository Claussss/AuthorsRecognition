I will not bandy with thee word for word,
But buckle with thee blows twice two for one. He draws his sword QUEEN MARGARET Hold, valiant Clifford: for a thousand causes
I would prolong a while the traitor’s life.
Wrath makes him deaf—speak thou, Northumberland. NORTHUMBERLAND Hold, Clifford—do not honour him so much
To prick thy finger though to wound his heart.
What valour were it when a cur doth grin
For one to thrust his hand between his teeth
When he might spurn him with his foot away?
It is war’s prize to take all vantages,
And ten to one is no impeach of valour.
They fight andtake York
