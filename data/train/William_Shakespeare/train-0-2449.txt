‘Thou art,’ quoth she, ‘a sea, a sovereign king,
And lo, there falls into thy boundless flood
Black lust, dishonour, shame, misgoverning,
Who seek to stain the ocean of thy blood.
If all these petty ills shall change thy good, Thy sea within a puddle’s womb is hearsed,
And not the puddle in thy sea dispersed.
