RICHARD GLOUCESTER Good morrow to my sovereign King and Queen.â€”
And princely peers, a happy time of day. KING EDWARD Happy indeed, as we have spent the day.
Brother, we have done deeds of charity,
Made peace of enmity, fair love of hate,
Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers. RICHARD GLOUCESTER
