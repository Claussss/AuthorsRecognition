DUKE SENIOR Fie on thee, I can tell what thou wouldst do. What, for a counter, would I do but good? DUKE SENIOR Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin;

As sensual as the brutish sting itself,
And all th
That thou with licence of free foot hast caught
Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.
