2.1
Enter Pompey, Menecrates, and Menas, in warlike manner If the great gods be just, they shall assist
The deeds of justest men. That what they do delay they not deny. Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays
The thing we sue for. We, ignorant of ourselves, Beg often our own harms, which the wise powers
Deny us for our good; so find we profit
By losing of our prayers.
