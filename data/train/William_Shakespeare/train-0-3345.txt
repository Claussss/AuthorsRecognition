KING RICHARD What said our cousin when you parted with him? ‘Farewell.’ And for my heart disdained that my tongue
Should so profane the word, that taught me craft
To counterfeit oppression of such grief
That words seemed buried in my sorrow’s grave.
Marry, would the word ‘farewell’ have lengthened
hours
And added years to his short banishment,
He should have had a volume of farewells;
But since it would not, he had none of me.
