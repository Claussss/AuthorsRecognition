Marry, and shall, and very willingly. Exit There is no seeming mercy in the King. Did you beg any? God forbid! I told him gently of our grievances,
Of his oath-breaking, which he mended thus:
By now forswearing that he is forsworn.
He calls us ‘rebels’, ‘traitors’, and will scourge
With haughty arms this hateful name in us.
