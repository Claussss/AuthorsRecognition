It was, Andronicus. Your reason, mighty lord? Because the girl should not survive her shame,
And by her presence still renew his sorrows. A reason mighty, strong, effectual;
A pattern, precedent, and lively warrant
For me, most wretched, to perform the like.
Die, die, Lavinia, and thy shame with thee,
And with thy shame thy fatherâ€™s sorrow die.
