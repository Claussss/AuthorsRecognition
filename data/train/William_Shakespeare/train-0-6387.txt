DUKE SENIOR (to Celia) O my dear niece, welcome thou art to me,
Even daughter; welcome in no less degree. PHOEBE (to Silvius.) I will not eat my word. Now thou art mine,
Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine. Enter Jaques de Bois, the second brother JAQUES DE BOIS Let me have audience for a word or two.
I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,
That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.
Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day
Men of great worth resorted to this forest,
Addressed a mighty power, which were on foot,
In his own conduct, purposely to take
His brother here, and put him to the sword.
And to the skirts of this wild wood he came
Where, meeting with an old religious man,
After some question with him was converted
Both from his enterprise and from the world,
His crown bequeathing to his banished brother,
And all their lands restored to them again
That were with him exiled. This to be true
I do engage my life.
