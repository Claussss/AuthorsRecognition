DIONYZA O your sweet queen! That the strict fates had pleased you’d brought her
hither
T’have blessed mine eyes with her! We cannot but obey The pow‘rs above us. Should I rage and roar
As doth the sea she lies in, yet the end
Must be as ’tis. My gentle babe Marina,
Whom for she was born at sea I have named so,
Here I charge your charity withal, and leave her
The infant of your care, beseeching you
To give her princely training, that she may be
Mannered as she is born.
