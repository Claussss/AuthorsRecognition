VALENTINE That’s the letter I writ to her friend. SPEED And that letter hath she delivered, and there an end. VALENTINE I would it were no worse. SPEED I’ll warrant you, ‘tis as well. For often have you writ to her, and she in modesty
Or else for want of idle time could not again reply,
Or fearing else some messenger that might her mind
discover,
Herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her
lover.
—All this I speak in print, for in print I found it. Why
muse you, sir? ‘Tis dinner-time.
