Who intercepts me in my expedition? DUCHESS OF YORK O, she that might have intercepted thee,
By strangling thee in her accursed womb,
From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done. QUEEN ELIZABETH Hid’st thou that forehead with a golden crown,
Where should be branded—if that right were right—
The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown,
And the dire death of my poor sons and brothers?
Tell me, thou villain-slave, where are my children?
