QUEEN MARGARET Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion.
(To Prince Edward) Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous,
Therefore delay not. Give thy hand to Warwick,
And with thy hand thy faith irrevocable
That only Warwickâ€™s daughter shall be thine. PRINCE EDWARD Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it,
And here to pledge my vow I give my hand.
He and Warwick clasp hands
