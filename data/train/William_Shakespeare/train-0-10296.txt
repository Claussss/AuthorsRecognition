One that speaks thus their voice? I’ll give my reasons, More worthier than their voices. They know the corn
Was not our recompense, resting well assured
They ne‘er did service for’t. Being pressed to th’ war,
Even when the navel of the state was touched,
They would not thread the gates. This kind of service
Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i’th’ war,
Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they showed
Most valour, spoke not for them. Th‘accusation
Which they have often made against the senate,
All cause unborn, could never be the native
Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?
How shall this bosom multiplied digest
The senate’s courtesy? Let deeds express
What’s like to be their words: ‘We did request it,
We are the greater poll, and in true fear
They gave us our demands.’ Thus we debase
The nature of our seats, and make the rabble
Call our cares fears, which will in time
Break ope the locks o’th’ senate and bring in
The crows to peck the eagles.
