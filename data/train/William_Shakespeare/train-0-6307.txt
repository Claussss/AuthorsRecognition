PHOEBE (aside) Dead shepherd, now I find thy saw of might:
‘Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?’ Sweet Phoebe— PHOEBE Ha, what sayst thou, Silvius? SILVIUS Sweet Phoebe, pity me. Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius. Wherever sorrow is, relief would be.
If you do sorrow at my grief in love,
By giving love your sorrow and my grief
Were both extermined.
