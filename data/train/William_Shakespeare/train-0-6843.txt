ORSINO (to Feste) O fellow, come, the song we had last night.
Mark it, Cesario, it is old and plain.
The spinsters, and the knitters in the sun,
And the free maids that weave their thread with
bones,
Do use to chant it. It is silly sooth,
And dallies with the innocence of love,
Like the old age. FESTE Are you ready, sir?
