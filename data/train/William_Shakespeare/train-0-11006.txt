I thank you, sir. Exit Gentleman You ever gentle gods, take my breath from me.
Let not my worser spirit tempt me again
To die before you please. EDGAR Well pray you, father. GLOUCESTER Now, good sir, what are you? A most poor man, made tame to fortune’s blows,
Who by the art of known and feeling sorrows
Am pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand,
I’ll lead you to some biding.
