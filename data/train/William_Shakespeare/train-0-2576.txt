‘No, no,’ quoth she, ‘no dame hereafter living
By my excuse shall claim excuse’s giving.’ Here with a sigh as if her heart would break
She throws forth Tarquin’s name. ‘He, he,’ she says—
But more than he her poor tongue could not speak,
Till after many accents and delays,
Untimely breathings, sick and short essays,
