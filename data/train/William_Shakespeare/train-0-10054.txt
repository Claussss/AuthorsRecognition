He reads Marina’s epitaph on the tomb ‘The fairest, sweetest, best lies here,
Who withered in her spring of year.
In nature’s garden, though by growth a bud,
She was the chiefest flower: she was good.’
No visor does become black villainy
So well as soft and tender flattery.
Let Pericles believe his daughter’s dead
And bear his courses to be ordered
By Lady Fortune, while our scene must play
His daughter’s woe and heavy well-a-day
In her unholy service. Patience then,
And think you now are all in Mytilene. Exit
