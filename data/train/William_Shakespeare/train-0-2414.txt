This said, his guilty hand plucked up the latch,
And with his knee the door he opens wide.
The dove sleeps fast that this night-owl will catch.
Thus treason works ere traitors be espied.
Who sees the lurking serpent steps aside, But she, sound sleeping, fearing no such thing,
Lies at the mercy of his mortal sting.
