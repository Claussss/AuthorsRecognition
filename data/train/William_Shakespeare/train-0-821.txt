HERALD I summon your grace to his majesty’s parliament holden at Bury the first of this next month. And my consent ne’er asked herein before?
This is close dealing. Well, I will be there. Exit Herald
My Nell, I take my leave; and, Master Sheriff,
Let not her penance exceed the King’s commission. An’t please your grace, here my commission stays,
And Sir John Stanley is appointed now
To take her with him to the Isle of Man.
