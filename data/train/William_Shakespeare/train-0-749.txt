BOLINGBROKE Master Hume, we are therefore provided. Will her ladyship behold and hear our exorcisms? HUME Ay, what else? Fear you not her courage. BOLINGBROKE I have heard her reported to be a woman of an invincible spirit. But it shall be convenient, Master Hume, that you be by her, aloft, while we be busy below. And so, I pray you, go in Godâ€™s name and leave us. Exit Hume Mother Jordan, be you prostrate and grovel on the earth.
