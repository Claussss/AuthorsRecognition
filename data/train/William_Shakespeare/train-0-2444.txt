For princes are the glass, the school, the book
Where subjects’ eyes do learn, do read, do look. ‘And wilt thou be the school where lust shall learn?
Must he in thee read lectures of such shame?
Wilt thou be glass wherein it shall discern
Authority for sin, warrant for blame,
To privilege dishonour in thy name?
