DOLL Well, Sheriff More, thou hast done more with thy good words than all they could with their weapons. Give me thy hand. Keep thy promise now for the King’s pardon, or, by the Lord, I’ll call thee a plain cony-catcher. Farewell, Sheriff More. And as we yield by thee
So make our peace; then thou deal’st honestly.
