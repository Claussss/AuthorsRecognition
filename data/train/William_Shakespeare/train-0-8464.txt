CORDELIA (to Lear) I yet beseech your majestyIf for I want that glib and oily art
To speak and purpose not—since what I well intend,
I’ll do’t before I speak—that you acknow
It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,
No unclean action or dishonoured step
That hath deprived me of your grace and favour,
But even the want of that for which I am rich—
A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue
As I am glad I have not, though not to have it
Hath lost me in your liking.
