What have we here? He reads the writings Why, this is just Aio Aeacidam, Romanos vincere posse.
These oracles are hardily attained
And hardly understood. Come, come, my lord,
The King is now in progress towards Saint Albans;
With him the husband of this lovely lady.
Thither goes these news as fast as horse can carry
themâ€”
A sorry breakfast for my lord Protector.
