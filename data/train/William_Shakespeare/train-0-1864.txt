RICHARD GLOUCESTER (to the gentlemen) Villains, set down the corpse, or by Saint Paul
I’ll make a corpse of him that disobeys. My lord, stand back and let the coffin pass. RICHARD GLOUCESTER Unmannered dog, stand thou when I command.
Advance thy halberd higher than my breast,
Or by Saint Paul I’ll strike thee to my foot
And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.
