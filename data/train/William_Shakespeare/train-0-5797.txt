My lord, your nobles, jealous of your absence,
Seek through your camp to find you. Good old knight, Collect them all together at my tent.
I’ll be before thee. I shall do’t, my lord. Exit O God of battles, steel my soldiers’ hearts.
Possess them not with fear. Take from them now
The sense of reck
Pluck their hearts from them. Not today, O Lord,
O not today, think not upon the fault
My father made in compassing the crown.
I Richard’s body have interred new,
And on it have bestowed more contrite tears
Than from it issued forced drops of blood.
Five hundred poor have I in yearly pay
Who twice a day their withered hands hold up
Toward heaven to pardon blood. And I have built
Two chantries, where the sad and solemn priests
Sing still for Richard’s soul. More will I do,
Though all that I can do is nothing worth,
Since that my penitence comes after ill,
Imploring pardon.
Enter the Duke of Gloucester
