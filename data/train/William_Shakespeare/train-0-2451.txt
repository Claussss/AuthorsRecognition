‘So let thy thoughts, low vassals to thy state’-
‘No more,’ quoth he, ‘by heaven, I will not hear thee.
Yield to my love. If not, enforced hate
Instead of love’s coy touch shall rudely tear thee.
That done, despitefully I mean to bear thee Unto the base bed of some rascal groom
To be thy partner in this shameful doom.’
