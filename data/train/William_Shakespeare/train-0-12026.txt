Kinsman, you might as well Speak this and act it in your glass as to
His ear which now disdains you. Come up to me, Quit me of these cold gyves, give me a sword,
Though it be rusty, and the charity
Of one meal lend me. Come before me then,
A good sword in thy hand, and do but say
That Emily is thine-I will forgive
The trespass thou hast done me, yea, my life,
If then thou carry’t; and brave souls in shades
That have died manly, which will seek of me
Some news from earth, they shall get none but this—
That thou art brave and noble.
