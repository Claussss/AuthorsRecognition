QUEEN MARGARET (aside) If that go forward, Henry’s hope is done. WARWICK (to Lady Bona) And, gracious madam, in our King’s behalf
I am commanded, with your leave and favour,
Humbly to kiss your hand, and with my tongue
To tell the passion of my sovereign’s heart,
Where fame, late ent‘ring at his heedful ears,
Hath placed thy beauty’s image and thy virtue.
