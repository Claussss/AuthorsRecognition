2.3
Enter the Earl of Northumberland, Lady Northumberland, and Lady Percy 
NORTHUMBERLAND I pray thee, loving wife and gentle daughter,
Give even way unto my rough affairs.
Put not you on the visage of the times
And be like them to Percy troublesome. LADY NORTHUMBERLAND I have given over; I will speak no more.
Do what you will; your wisdom be your guide.
