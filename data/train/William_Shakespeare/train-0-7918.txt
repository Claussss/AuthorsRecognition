LUCIO (aside to Isabella) O, to him, to him, wench! He will relent.
He’s coming; I perceive’t. PROVOST (aside) Pray heaven she win him! We cannot weigh our brother with ourself.
Great men may jest with saints; ’tis wit in them,
But in the less, foul profanation. LUCIO (aside to Isabella) Thou’rt i’th’ right, girl. More o’
that.
