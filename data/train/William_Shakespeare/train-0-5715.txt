Well, ‘tis not so, my Lord High Constable.
But though we think it so, it is no matter.
In cases of defence ’tis best to weigh
The enemy more mighty than he seems.
So the proportions of defence are filled—
Which, of a weak and niggardly projection,
Doth like a miser spoil his coat with scanting
A little cloth.
