SIR JOHN Not I, I assure thee. Setting the attraction of my good parts aside, I have no other charms. MISTRESS QUICKLY Blessing on your heart for’t! SIR JOHN But I pray thee tell me this: has Ford’s wife and Page’s wife acquainted each other how they love me? MISTRESS QUICKLY O God no, sir; that were a jest indeed! They have not so little grace, I hope. That were a trick indeed! But Mistress Page would desire you to send her your little page of all loves. Her husband has a marvellous infection to the little page; and, truly, Master Page is an honest man. Never a wife in Windsor leads a better life than she does. Do what she will; say what she will; take all, pay all; go to bed when she list; rise when she list; all is as she will. And, truly, she deserves it, for if there be a kind woman in Windsor, she is one. You must send her your page, no remedy.
