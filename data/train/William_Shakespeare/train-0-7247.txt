Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here. HECTOR (to Aeneas) The worthiest of them, tell me name by name.
But for Achilles, mine own searching eyes
Shall find him by his large and portly size. AGAMEMNON (embracing him) Worthy of arms, as welcome as to one
 That would be rid of such an enemy.
But that’s no welcome. Understand more clear:
What’s past and what’s to come is strewed with husks
And formless ruin of oblivion,
But in this extant moment faith and troth,
Strained purely from all hollow bias-drawing,
Bids thee with most divine integrity
From heart of very heart, ‘Great Hector, welcome!’
