REGAN Not altogether so, sir. I look not for you yet, nor am provided
For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;
For those that mingle reason with your passion
Must be content to think you are old, and so—
But she knows what she does. LEAR Is this well spoken now? I dare avouch it, sir. What, fifty followers?
Is it not well? What should you need of more,
Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger
Speaks ‘gainst so great a number? How in a house
Should many people under two commands
Hold amity? ’Tis hard, almost impossible.
