OLD SHEPHERD How if it be false, son? CLOWN If it be ne’er so false, a true gentleman may swear it in the behalf of his friend, (to Autolycus) and I’ll swear to the Prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be drunk; but I’ll swear it, and I would thou wouldst be a tall fellow of thy hands.
