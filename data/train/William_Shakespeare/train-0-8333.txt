OTHELLO Was that mine? IAGO Yours, by this hand. And to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife. She gave it him, and he hath given it his whore. OTHELLO I would have him nine years a-killing. A fine woman, a fair woman, a sweet woman. IAGO Nay, you must forget that. OTHELLO Ay, let her rot and perish, and be damned tonight, for she shall not live. No, my heart is turned to stone; I strike it, and it hurts my hand. O, the world hath not a sweeter creature! She might lie by an emperorâ€™s side, and command him tasks.
