I am resolved to bear a greater storm
Than any thou canst conjure up today—
And that I’ll write upon thy burgonet
Might I but know thee by thy household badge. Now by my father’s badge, old Neville’s crest,
The rampant bear chained to the ragged staff,
This day I’ll wear aloft my burgonet,
As on a mountain top the cedar shows
That keeps his leaves in spite of any storm,
Even to affright thee with the view thereof.
