Sir, go you in; and madam, go with him,
And go, Sir Paris. Everyone prepare
To follow this fair corpse unto her grave.

Move them no more by crossing their high will. They cast rosemary on Juliet, and shut the curtains.Exeunt all but the Nurse and Musicians Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up,
For well you know this is a pitiful case.
