SIR JOHN Hal, if thou see me down in the battle, and bestride me, so. ’Tis a point of friendship. PRINCE HARRY Nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship. Say thy prayers, and farewell. SIR JOHN I would ’twere bed-time, Hal, and all well. PRINCE HARRY Why, thou owest God a death. Exit SIR JOHN ‘Tis not due yet. I would be loath to pay him before his day. What need I be so forward with him that calls not on me? Well, ’tis no matter; honour pricks me on. Yea, but how if honour prick me off when I come on? How then? Can honour set-to a leg? No. Or an arm? No. Or take away the grief of a wound? No. Honour hath no skill in surgery, then? No. What is honour? A word. What is in that word ‘honour’? What is that ‘honour’ ? Air. A trim reckoning! Who hath it? He that died o’ Wednesday. Doth he feel it? No. Doth he hear it? No. ’Tis insensible then? Yea, to the dead. But will it not live with the living? No. Why? Detraction will not suffer it. Therefore I’ll none of it. Honour is a mere scutcheon. And so ends my catechism.
