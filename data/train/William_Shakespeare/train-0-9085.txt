They were suborned. Malcolm and Donalbain, the King’s two sons,
Are stol’n away and fled, which puts upon them
Suspicion of the deed. ’Gainst nature still. Thriftless ambition, that will raven up
Thine own life’s means! Then ’tis most like
The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth. He is already named and gone to Scone
To be invested.
