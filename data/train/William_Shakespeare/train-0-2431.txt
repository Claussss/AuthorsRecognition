‘I have debated even in my soul
What wrong, what shame, what sorrow I shall breed;
But nothing can affection’s course control,
Or stop the headlong fury of his speed.
I know repentant tears ensue the deed, Reproach, disdain, and deadly enmity,
Yet strive I to embrace mine infamy.’ This said, he shakes aloft his Roman blade,
Which like a falcon tow’ring in the skies
Coucheth the fowl below with his wings’ shade
Whose crooked beak threats, if he mount he dies.
So under his insulting falchion lies
