Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
This is the very ecstasy of love,
Whose violent property fordoes itself
And leads the will to desperate undertakings
As oft as any passion under heaven
That does afflict our natures. I am sorryâ€”
What, have you given him any hard words of late? No, my good lord, but as you did command
I did repel his letters and denied
His access to me.
