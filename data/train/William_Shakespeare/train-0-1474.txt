Scoff on, vile fiend and shameless courtesan.
I trust ere long to choke thee with thine own,
And make thee curse the harvest of that corn. Your grace may starve, perhaps, before that time. O let no words, but deeds, revenge this treason. What will you do, good graybeard? Break a lance
And run a-tilt at death within a chair?
