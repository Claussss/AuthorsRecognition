A hundred thousand rebels die in this.
Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein. Enter Sir Walter Blunt How now, good Blunt ? Thy looks are full of speed. So hath the business that I come to speak of. Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word
That Douglas and the English rebels met
The eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury.
A mighty and a fearful head they are,
If promises be kept on every hand,
As ever offered foul play in a state.
