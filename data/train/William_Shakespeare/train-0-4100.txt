Why answer not the double majesties
This friendly treaty of our threatened town? KING PHILIP Speak England first, that hath been forward first
To speak unto this city: what say you? If that the Dauphin there, thy princely son, 485
Can in this book of beauty read ‘I love’,
Her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen;
For Anjou and fair Touraine, Maine, Poitou,
And all that we upon this side the sea—
Except this city now by us besieged—490
Find liable to our crown and dignity,
Shall gild her bridal bed, and make her rich
In titles, honours, and promotions,
As she in beauty, education, blood,
Holds hand with any princess of the world. 495
