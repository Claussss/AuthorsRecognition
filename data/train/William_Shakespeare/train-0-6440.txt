A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces of ordnance goes off What does this mean, my lord? The King doth wake tonight and takes his rouse,
Keeps wassail, and the swaggâ€™ring upspring reels,
And as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down
The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
The triumph of his pledge.
