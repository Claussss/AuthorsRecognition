A quarrel, ho, already! What’s the matter? About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring
That she did give me, whose posy was
For all the world like cutlers’ poetry
Upon a knife—‘Love me and leave me not’. What talk you of the posy or the value? You swore to me when I did give it you
That you would wear it till your hour of death,
And that it should lie with you in your grave.
Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths
You should have been respective and have kept it.
Gave it a judge’s clerk?—no, God’s my judge,
The clerk will ne’er wear hair on’s face that had it.
