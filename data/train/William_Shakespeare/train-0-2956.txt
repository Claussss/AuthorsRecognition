4.4
Enter Antipholus of Ephesus with the Officer 
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Fear me not, man, I will not break away.
I’ll give thee ere I leave thee so much money
To warrant thee as I am ‘rested for.
My wife is in a wayward mood today,
And will not lightly trust the messenger
That I should be attached in Ephesus.
I tell you ’twill sound harshly in her ears.
