ALCIBIADES throwing up a glove Then there’s my glove. Descend, and open your uncharged ports.
Those enemies of Timon’s and mine own
Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof
Fall, and no more; and to atone your fears
With my more noble meaning, not a man
Shall pass his quarter or offend the stream
Of regular justice in your city’s bounds
But shall be remedied to your public laws
At heaviest answer.
