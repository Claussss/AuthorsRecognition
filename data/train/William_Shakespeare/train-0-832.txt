SOMERSET kneeling before King Henry All health unto my gracious sovereign. Welcome, Lord Somerset. What news from France? That all your interest in those territories
Is utterly bereft you—all is lost. Cold news, Lord Somerset; but God’s will be done. Somerset rises YORK (aside) Cold news for me, for I had hope of France,
As firmly as I hope for fertile England.
Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud,
And caterpillars eat my leaves away. 90
But I will remedy this gear ere long,
Or sell my title for a glorious grave.
