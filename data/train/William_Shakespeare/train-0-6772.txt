Sure, my noble lord, If she be so abandoned to her sorrow
As it is spoke, she never will admit me. Be clamorous, and leap all civil bounds,
Rather than make unprofited return. Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then? O then unfold the passion of my love,
Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith.
It shall become thee well to act my woes—
She will attend it better in thy youth
Than in a nuncio’s of more grave aspect.
