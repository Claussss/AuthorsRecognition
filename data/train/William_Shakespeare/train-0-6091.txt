Exeunt Varrus and Claudio at one door, Brutus and Lucius at another door 
5.1
Enter Octavius, Antony, and their army Now, Antony, our hopes are answered.
You said the enemy would not come down,
But keep the hills and upper regions.
It proves not so; their battles are at hand.
They mean to warn us at Philippi here,
Answering before we do demand of them.
