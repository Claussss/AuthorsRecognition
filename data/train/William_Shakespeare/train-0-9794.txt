FIRST LORD DUMAINE (aside) I begin to love him for this. BERTRAM (aside) For this description of thine honesty? A pox upon him! For me, he’s more and more a cat. INTERPRETER What say you to his expertness in war? PAROLES Faith, sir, he’s led the drum before the English tragedians. To belie him I will not, and more of his soldiership I know not, except in that country he had the honour to be the officer at a place there called Mile End, to instruct for the doubling of files. I would do the man what honour I can, but of this I am not certain.
