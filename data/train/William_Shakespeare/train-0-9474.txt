Is come into the field. Go charge Agrippa Plant those that have revolted in the van,
That Antony may seem to spend his fury
Upon himself. 10 Exeunt Messenger at one door, Caesar and Dolabella at another Alexas did revolt, and went to Jewry on
Affairs of Antony; there did dissuade
Great Herod to incline himself to Caesar
And leave his master, Antony. For this pains,

That fell away have entertainment but
No honourable trust. I have done ill,
Of which I do accuse myself so sorely
That I will joy no more.
