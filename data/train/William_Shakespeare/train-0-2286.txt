Whose beams upon his hairless face are fixed,
As if from thence they borrowed all their shine.
Were never four such lamps together mixed,
Had not his clouded with his brow’s repine. But hers, which through the crystal tears gave light,
Shone like the moon in water seen by night. ‘O, where am I?’ quoth she; ‘in earth or heaven,
Or in the ocean drenched, or in the fire?
What hour is this: or morn or weary even?
Do I delight to die, or life desire?
