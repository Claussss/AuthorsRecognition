3.2
Enter Joan la Pucelle, disguised, with four French Soldiers with sacks upon their backs These are the city gates, the gates of Rouen,
Through which our policy must make a breach.
Take heed. Be wary how you place your words.
Talk like the vulgar sort of market men
That come to gather money for their corn.
If we have entrance, as I hope we shall,
And that we find the slothful watch but weak,
Iâ€™ll by a sign give notice to our friends,
That Charles the Dauphin may encounter them.
