DOLL to Sherif Sir, your free bounty much contents my mind.
Commend me to that good sheriff Master More,
And tell him had’t not been for his persuasion
John Lincoln had not hung here as he does.
We would first have locked up in Leaden Hall,
And there been burned to ashes with the roof. Woman, what Master More did was a subject’s duty,
And hath so pleased our gracious lord the King
That he is hence removed to higher place
And made of Council to his majesty.
