Nor shall it, Harry, for the hour is come
To end the one of us, and would to God
Thy name in arms were now as great as mine. PRINCE HARRY I’ll make it greater ere I part from thee,
And all the budding honours on thy crest
I’ll crop to make a garland for my head. I can no longer brook thy vanities. They fight.
