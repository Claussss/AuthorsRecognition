Ah, what sharp stings are in her mildest words!
Reynaldo, you did never lack advice so much
As letting her pass so. Had I spoke with her,
I could have well diverted her intents,
Which thus she hath prevented. Pardon me, madam. If I had given you this at over-night
She might have been o’erta’en—and yet she writes
Pursuit would be but vain.
