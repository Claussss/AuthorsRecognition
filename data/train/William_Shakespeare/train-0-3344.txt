KING RICHARD We did observe.â€”Cousin Aumerle,
How far brought you high Hereford on his way? I brought high Hereford, if you call him so,
But to the next highway, and there I left him. KING RICHARD And say, what store of parting tears were shed? Faith, none for me, except the north-east wind,
Which then grew bitterly against our faces,
Awaked the sleeping rheum, and so by chance
Did grace our hollow parting with a tear.
