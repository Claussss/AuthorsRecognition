PRINCE OF WALES Successfully, I thank the gracious heavens.
Some of their strongest cities we have wonâ€”
As Harfleur, L
And others wasted, leaving at our heels
A wide, apparent field and beaten path
For solitariness to progress in.
Yet those that would submit we kindly pardoned,
For who in scorn refused our proffered peace
Endured the penalty of sharp revenge.
