Enter Proteus How now, Sir Proteus, is your countryman,
According to our proclamation, gone? PROTEUS Gone, my good lord. My daughter takes his going grievously? A little time, my lord, will kill that grief. So I believe, but Thurio thinks not so.
Proteus, the good conceit I hold of thee—
For thou hast shown some sign of good desert—
Makes me the better to confer with thee.
