QUEEN GERTRUDE As kill a king? HAMLET Ay, lady, ’twas my word. (To Polonius) Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool,
farewell.
I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.
Thou find’st to be too busy is some danger.—
Leave wringing of your hands. Peace, sit you down,
And let me wring your heart; for so I shall
If it be made of penetrable stuff,
If damned custom have not brassed it so
That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
