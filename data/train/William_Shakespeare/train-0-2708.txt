Enter a Frenchman in haste FLEEING FRENCHMAN Fly, countrymen and citizens of France!
Sweet-flow’ring peace, the root of happy life,
Is quite abandoned and expulsed the land.
Instead of whom, ransack-constraining war
Sits like to ravens upon your houses’ tops.
Slaughter and mischief walk within your streets
And, unrestrained, make havoc as they pass,
The form whereof, even now, myself beheld
Upon this fair mountain, whence I came.
For so far off as I directed mine eyes
I might perceive five cities all on fire,
Cornfields and vineyards burning like an oven,
And, as the reeking vapour in the wind
Y-turn
The poor inhabitants, escaped the flame,
Fall numberless upon the soldiers’ pikes.
Three ways these dreadful ministers of wrath
Do tread the measures of their tragic march:
Upon the right hand comes the conquering King,
Upon the left his hot, unbridled son,
And in the midst their nation’s glittering host.
All which, though distant, yet conspire in one
To leave a desolation where they come.
Fly, therefore, citizens, if you be wise.
Seek out some habitation further off.
Here, if you stay, your wives will be abused,
Your treasure shared before your weeping eyes.
Shelter you yourselves, for now the storm doth rise.
Away, away! Methinks I hear their drums!
Ah, wretched France, I greatly fear thy fall;
Thy glory shaketh like a tottering wall.
