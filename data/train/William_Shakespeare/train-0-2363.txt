And so ’tis thine; but know it is as good
To wither in my breast as in his blood. ‘Here was thy father’s bed, here in my breast.
Thou art the next of blood, and ’tis thy right.
Lo, in this hollow cradle take thy rest;
My throbbing heart shall rock thee day and night. There shall not be one minute in an hour
Wherein I will not kiss my sweet love’s flower.’
