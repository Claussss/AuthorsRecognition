Had I a glass I would. What, you mean my face? Well aimed, of such a young one. Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you. Yet you are withered. PETRUCCIO ‘Tis with cares. I care not. Nay, hear you, Kate. In sooth, you scape not so. 235 I chafe you if I tarry. Let me go. No, not a whit. I find you passing gentle.
‘Twas told me you were rough, and coy, and sullen,
And now I find report a very liar,
For thou art pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,
But slow in speech, yet sweet as springtime flowers.
Thou canst not frown. Thou canst not look askance,
Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,
Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk,
But thou with mildness entertain’st thy wooers,
With gentle conference, soft, and affable.
Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?
O sland’rous world ! Kate like the hazel twig
Is straight and slender, and as brown in hue
As hazelnuts, and sweeter than the kernels.
O let me see thee walk. Thou dost not halt.
