She tears the letter and drops the pieces Go, get you gone, and let the papers lie.
You would be fing’ring them to anger me. LUCETTA (aside) She makes it strange, but she would be best pleased
To be so angered with another letter. Nay, would I were so angered with the same.
O hateful hands, to tear such loving words;
Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey
And kill the bees that yield it with your stings.
I’ll kiss each several paper for amends.
