Good Paulina, Who hast the memory of Hermione,
I know, in honour—O, that ever I
Had squared me to thy counsel! Then even now
I might have looked upon my queen’s full eyes,
Have taken treasure from her lips. And left them More rich for what they yielded. Thou speak’st truth. No more such wives, therefore no wife. One worse,
And better used, would make her sainted spirit
Again possess her corpse, and on this stage,
Where we offenders mourn, appear soul-vexed,
And begin, ‘Why to me?’
