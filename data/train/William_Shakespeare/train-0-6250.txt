CORIN You have too courtly a wit for me. I’ll rest. TOUCHSTONE Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man. God make incision in thee, thou art raw. CORIN Sir, I am a true labourer. I earn that I eat, get that I wear; owe no man hate, envy no man’s happiness; glad of other men’s good, content with my harm; and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck.
