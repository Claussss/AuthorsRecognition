KING RICHARD Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go? Your highness told me I should post before. KING RICHARD My mind is changed. Enter Lord Stanley Stanley, what news with you? None, good my liege, to please you with the hearing,
Nor none so bad but well may be reported. KING RICHARD Hoyday, a riddle! Neither good nor bad.
Why needâ€™st thou run so many mile about
When thou mayst tell thy tale the nearest way?
Once more, what news?
