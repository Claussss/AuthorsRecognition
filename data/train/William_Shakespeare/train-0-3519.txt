Good aunt, stand up. DUCHESS OF YORK I do not sue to stand. Pardon is all the suit I have in hand. I pardon him as God shall pardon me. York and Aumerle rise DUCHESS OF YORK O, happy vantage of a kneeling knee!
Yet am I sick for fear. Speak it again.
Twice saying pardon doth not pardon twain,
But makes one pardon strong.
