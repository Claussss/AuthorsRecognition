ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS How now? A madman? Why, thou peevish sheep,
What ship of Epidamnum stays for me? DROMIO OF SYRACUSE A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage. ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Thou drunken slave, I sent thee for a rope,
And told thee to what purpose and what end. DROMIO OF SYRACUSE You sent me for a rop
You sent me to the bay, sir, for a barque.
