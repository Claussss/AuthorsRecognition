Here lies the east. Doth not the day break here? O pardon, sir, it doth; and yon grey lines
That fret the clouds are messengers of day. CASCA
You shall confess that you are both deceived.
He points his sword
Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises,
Which is a great way growing on the south,
Weighing the youthful season of the year.
Some two months hence up higher toward the north
He first presents his fire, and the high east
Stands, as the Capitol, directly here.
