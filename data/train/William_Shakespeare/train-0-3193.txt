I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart
The chain were longer and the letter short? Ay, or I would these hands might never part. We are wise girls to mock our lovers so. They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.
That same Biron I’ll torture ere I go.
O that I knew he were but in by th’ week!—
How I would make him fawn, and beg, and seek,
And wait the season, and observe the times,
And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes,
And shape his service wholly to my hests,
And make him proud to make me proud that jests!
So pursuivant-like would I o’ersway his state
That he should be my fool, and I his fate.
