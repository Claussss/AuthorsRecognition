’Tis their fresh supplies. It is a day turned strangely. Or betimes
Let’s reinforce, or fly. 5.5
Enter Posthumus like a poor soldier, and a Briton Lord Cam’st thou from where they made the stand? POSTHUMUS I did, Though you, it seems, come from the fliers. No blame be to you, sir, for all was lost,
But that the heavens fought. The King himself
Of his wings destitute, the army broken,
And but the backs of Britons seen, all flying
Through a strait lane; the enemy full-hearted,
Lolling the tongue with slaught‘ring, having work
More plentiful than tools to do’t, struck down
Some mortally, some slightly touched, some falling
Merely through fear, that the strait pass was dammed
With dead men hurt behind, and cowards living
To die with lengthened shame.
