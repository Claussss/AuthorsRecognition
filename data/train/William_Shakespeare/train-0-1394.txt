Enter Joan la Pucelle Here, here she comes. (To Joan) I’ll have a bout with
thee.
Devil or devil’s dam, I’ll conjure thee.
Blood will I draw on thee—thou art a witch—
And straightway give thy soul to him thou serv’st. Come, come, ’tis only I that must disgrace thee. Here they fight Heavens, can you suffer hell so to prevail?
My breast I’ll burst with straining of my courage
And from my shoulders crack my arms asunder
But I will chastise this high-minded strumpet.
