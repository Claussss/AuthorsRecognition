KING RICHARD I do remember me, Henry the Sixth
Did prophesy that Richmond should be king,
When Richmond was a little peevish boy.
A king... perhaps... perhaps. KING RICHARD How chance the prophet could not at that time
Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him? My lord, your promise for the earldom.
