And from thy burgonet I’ll rend thy bear,
And tread it under foot with all contempt,
Despite the bearherd that protects the bear. YOUNG CLIFFORD And so to arms, victorious father,
To quell the rebels and their complices. Fie, charity, for shame! Speak not in spite—
For you shall sup with Jesu Christ tonight.
