No, my lord, I’ll fight. You will? Why, happy man be’s dole!—My brother,
Are you so fond of your young prince as we
Do seem to be of ours? If at home, sir, He’s all my exercise, my mirth, my matter;
Now my sworn friend, and then mine enemy;
My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all.
He makes a July’s day short as December,
And with his varying childness cures in me
Thoughts that would thick my blood.
