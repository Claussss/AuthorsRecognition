SOMERSET What are they that fly there? Richard and Hastings—let them go. Here is the Duke. KING EDWARD ‘The Duke’! Why, Warwick, when we parted,
Thou calledst me king. WARWICK Ay, but the case is altered. When you disgraced me in my embassade,
Then I degraded you from being king,
And come now to create you Duke of York.
Alas, how should you govern any kingdom
That know not how to use ambassadors,
Nor how to be contented with one wife,
Nor how to use your brothers brotherly,
Nor how to study for the people’s welfare,
Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies?
