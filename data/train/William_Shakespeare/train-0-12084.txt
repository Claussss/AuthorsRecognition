Let it not fall again, sir. Say, Emilia, If one of them were dead—as one must—are you
Content to take the other to your husband?
They cannot both enjoy you. They are princes
As goodly as your own eyes, and as noble
As ever fame yet spoke of. Look upon ’em,
And if you can love, end this difference.
I give consent. (To Palamon and Arcite) Are you
content too, princes?
