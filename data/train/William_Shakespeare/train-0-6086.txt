I should not urge thy duty past thy might.
I know young bloods look for a time of rest. LUCIUS I have slept, my lord, already. It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again.
I will not hold thee long. If I do live,
I will be good to thee. Lucius plays music and sings a song, and so falls asleep  This is a sleepy tune. O murd‘rous slumber,
Lay’st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy
That plays thee music?—Gentle knave, good night.
I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee.
If thou dost nod thou break’st thy instrument;
I’ll take it from thee, and, good boy, good night.
