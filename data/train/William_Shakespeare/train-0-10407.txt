SICINIUS and BRUTUS Say not we brought it. MENENIUS How? Was’t we? We loved him, but like beasts and cowardly nobles
Gave way unto your clusters, who did hoot
Him out o’th’ city. They’ll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,
The second name of men, obeys his points
As if he were his officer. Desperation
Is all the policy, strength, and defence
That Rome can make against them.
