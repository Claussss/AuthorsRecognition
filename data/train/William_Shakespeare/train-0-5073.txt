Enter Master Fenton and Anne My heart misgives me: here comes Master Fenton.—
How now, Master Fenton? Pardon, good father. Good my mother, pardon. Now, mistress, how chance you went not with Master Slender? Why went you not with Master Doctor, maid? You do amaze her. Hear the truth of it.
You would have married her, most shamefully,
Where there was no proportion held in love.
The truth is, she and I, long since contracted,
Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us.
Th’offence is holy that she hath committed,
And this deceit loses the name of craft,
Of disobedience, or unduteous title,
Since therein she doth evitate and shun
A thousand irreligious cursed hours
Which forced marriage would have brought upon her.
