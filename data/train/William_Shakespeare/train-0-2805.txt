Sc. 18
Enter fat one door 
KING EDWARD No more, Queen Philipâ€”pacify yourself.
Copland, except he can excuse his fault,
Shall find displeasure written in our looks.
And now, unto this proud, resisting town.
Soldiers, assault! I will no longer stay
To be deluded by their false delays.
Put all to sword, and make the spoil your own.
