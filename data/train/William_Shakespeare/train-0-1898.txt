RICHARD GLOUCESTER I cannot tell. The world is grown so bad
That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch.

There’s many a gentle person made a jack. QUEEN ELIZABETH Come, come, we know your meaning, brother
Gloucester.
You envy my advancement, and my friends’.
God grant we never may have need of you.
