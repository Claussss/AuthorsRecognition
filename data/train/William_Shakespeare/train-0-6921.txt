VIOLA With the same ’haviour That your passion bears goes on my master’s griefs. OLIVIA (giving a jewel) Here, wear this jewel for me, ’tis my picture—
Refuse it not, it hath no tongue to vex you—
And I beseech you come again tomorrow.
What shall you ask of me that I’ll deny,
That honour, saved, may upon asking give?
