KING EDWARD Why, then, his epitaph is lasting praise. Yet, good my lord, ’tis too much wilfulness
To let his blood be spilt, that may be saved. KING EDWARD Exclaim no more, for none of you can tell
Whether a borrowed aid will serve or no.
Perhaps he is already slain or ta’en.
And dare a falcon when she’s in her flight,
And ever after she’ll be haggard-like.
Let Edward be delivered by our hands
And, still in danger, he’ll expect the like.
But if himself himself redeem from thence,
He will have vanquished, cheerful, death and fear,
And ever after dread their force no more
Than if they were but babes or captive slaves.
