Courageous Bedford, let us now persuade you. Not to be gone from hence; for once I read
That stout Pendragon, in his litter sick,
Came to the field and vanquish
Methinks I should revive the soldiersâ€™ hearts,
Because I ever found them as myself. Undaunted spirit in a dying breast!
Then be it so; heavens keep old Bedford safe.
And now no more ado, brave Burgundy,
But gather we our forces out of hand,
And set upon our boasting enemy.
