I would I had, so I had broke thy pate
And asked thee mercy for’t. Good faith, across! But my good lord, ’tis thus: will you be cured
Of your infirmity? O will you eat No grapes, my royal fox? Yes, but you will,
My noble grapes, an if my royal fox
Could reach them. I have seen a medicine
That’s able to breathe life into a stone,
Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary
With sprightly fire and motion; whose simple touch
Is powerful to araise King P
To give great Charlemagne a pen in’s hand,
And write to her a love-line.
