LYSANDER Now she holds me not. Now follow, if thou dar’st, to try whose right,
Of thine or mine, is most in Helena. Follow? Nay, I’ll go with thee, cheek by jowl. Exeunt Lysander and Demetrius You, mistress, all this coil is long of you.
Nay, go not back. HELENA I will not trust you, I, Nor longer stay in your curst company.
Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray;
My legs are longer, though, to run away. Exit
