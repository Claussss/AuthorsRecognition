PRINCE HENRY How fares your majesty? Poisoned, ill fare! Dead, forsook, cast off;
And none of you will bid the winter come
To thrust his icy fingers in my maw,
Nor let my kingdomâ€™s rivers take their course
Through my burned bosom, nor entreat the north
To make his bleak winds kiss my parch
And comfort me with cold. I do not ask you much;
I beg cold comfort, and you are so strait
And so ingrateful you deny me that.
