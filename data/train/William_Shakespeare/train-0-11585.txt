Exeunt Stefano, Trinculo, and Caliban, pursued by spirits (To Ariel) Go, charge my goblins that they grind their
joints
With dry convulsions, shorten up their sinews
With aged cramps, and more pinch-spotted make
them
Than pard or cat oâ€™mountain. Cries within Hark, they roar! Let them be hunted soundly. At this hour
Lies at my mercy all mine enemies.
Shortly shall all my labours end, and thou
Shalt have the air at freedom. For a little,
Follow, and do me service.
