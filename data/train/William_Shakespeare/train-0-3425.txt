NORTHUMBERLAND Your grace mistakes. Only to be brief
Left I his title out. The time hath been, Would you have been so brief with him, he would
Have been so brief with you to shorten you,
For taking so the head, your whole headâ€™s length. BOLINGBROKE Mistake not, uncle, further than you should. Take not, good cousin, further than you should,
Lest you mistake the heavens are over our heads.
