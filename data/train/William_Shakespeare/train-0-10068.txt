LYSIMACHUS moved Thou couldst have spoke so well, ne’er dreamt thou
couldst.
He lifts her up with his hands
Though I brought hither a corrupted mind,
Thy speech hath altered it, He wipes the wet from her eyes  Thy tears so well hath laved that they’re now white.
I came here meaning but to pay the price,
A piece of gold for thy virginity;
Here’s twenty to relieve thine honesty.
Persever still in that clear way thou goest,
And the gods strengthen thee.
