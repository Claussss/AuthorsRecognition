Thanks, Ren
Fit to be made companion with a king.
What answer makes your grace unto my suit? Since thou dost deign to woo her little worth
To be the princely bride of such a lord,
Upon condition I may quietly
Enjoy mine own, the countries Maine and Anjou,
Free from oppression or the stroke of war,
My daughter shall be Henryâ€™s, if he please.
