Despair not, madam. QUEEN Who shall hinder me? I will despair, and be at enmity
With cozening hope. He is a flatterer,
A parasite, a keeper-back of death,
Who gently would dissolve the bonds of life,
Which false hope lingers in extremity. Enter the Duke of York, wearing a gorget GREEN Here comes the Duke of York.
