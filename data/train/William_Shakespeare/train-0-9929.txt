Before help comes, up comes their prize Ha, bots on’t, ’tis come at last, and ’tis turned to a
rusty armour. An armour, friends? I pray you let me see it.
(Aside) Thanks, fortune, yet that after all thy crosses
Thou giv‘st me somewhat to repair my losses,
And though it was mine own, part of my heritage
Which my dead father did bequeath to me
With this strict charge ev’n as he left his life:
‘Keep it, my Pericles; it hath been a shield
‘Twixt me and death,’ and pointed to this brace,
‘For that it saved me, keep it. In like necessity,
The which the Gods forfend, the same may defend thee.’
It kept where I kept, I so dearly loved it,
Till the rough seas that spares not any man
Took it in rage, though calmed have giv’n’t again.
I thank thee for’t. My shipwreck now’s no ill,
Since I have here my father gave in ’s will.
