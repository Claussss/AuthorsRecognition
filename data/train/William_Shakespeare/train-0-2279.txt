‘What, canst thou talk?’ quoth she. ‘Hast thou a tongue?
O, would thou hadst not, or I had no hearing!
Thy mermaid’s voice hath done me double wrong.
I had my load before, now pressed with bearing: Melodious discord, heavenly tune harsh sounding,
Ears’ deep-sweet music, and heart’s deep-sore
wounding.
