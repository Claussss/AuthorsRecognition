For ever and for ever farewell, Brutus.
If we do meet again, we’ll smile indeed.
If not, ’tis true this parting was well made. Why then, lead on. O that a man might know
The end of this day’s business ere it come!
But it sufliceth that the day will end,
And then the end is known.—Come, ho, away!
Exeunt
