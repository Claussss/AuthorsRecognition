I would outnight you, did nobody come. But hark, I hear the footing of a man. Enter Stefano, a messenger Who comes so fast in silence of the night? STEFANO A friend. A friendâ€”what friend? Your name, I pray you, friend? Stefano is my name, and I bring word
My mistress will before the break of day
Be here at Belmont. She doth stray about
By holy crosses, where she kneels and prays
For happy wedlock hours.
