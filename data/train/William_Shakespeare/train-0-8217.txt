GENTLEMEN Excellent well. CASSIO Why, very well then. You must not think then that I am drunk. To th’ platform, masters. Come, let’s set the watch. Exeunt Gentlemen You see this fellow that is gone before—
He’s a soldier fit to stand by Caesar
And give direction; and do but see his vice.
‘Tis to his virtue a just equinox,
The one as long as th’other. ’Tis pity of him.
I fear the trust Othello puts him in,
On some odd time of his infirmity,
Will shake this island.
