Renowned Edward, give me leave, I pray,
To lead my soldiers where I may relieve
Your graceâ€™s son, in danger to be slain.
The snares of French, like emmets on a bank,
Muster about him whilst he, lion-like,
Entangled in the net of their assaults,
Franticly rends and bites the woven toil.
But all in vain. He cannot free himself.
