No, I will to Ireland, to his majesty.
Farewell: if heart’s presages be not vain
We three here part that ne’er shall meet again. That’s as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke. Alas, poor Duke, the task he undertakes
Is numb’ring sands and drinking oceans dry.
Where one on his side fights, thousands will fly.
