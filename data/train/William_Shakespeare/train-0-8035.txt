Enter the Provost, with Ragusine’s head Here is the head; I’ll carry it myself. Convenient is it. Make a swift return,
For I would commune with you of such things
That want no ear but yours. PROVOST I’ll make all speed. ISABELLA (within) Peace, ho, be here! The tongue of Isabel. She’s come to know
If yet her brother’s pardon be come hither;
But I will keep her ignorant of her good,
To make her heavenly comforts of despair
When it is least expected.
