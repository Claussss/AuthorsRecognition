Hereby, upon the edge of yonder coppice—
A stand where you may make the fairest shoot. I thank my beauty, I am fair that shoot,
And thereupon thou speak’st ‘the fairest shoot’. Pardon me, madam, for I meant not so. What, what? First praise me, and again say no?
O short-lived pride! Not fair? Alack, for woe !
