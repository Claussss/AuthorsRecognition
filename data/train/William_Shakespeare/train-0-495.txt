Sir, I shall not be slack. In sign whereof,
Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,
And quaff carouses to our mistress’ health,
And do as adversaries do in law—
Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends. GRUMIO and BIONDELLO O excellent motion! Fellows, let’s be gone. The motion’s good indeed, and be it so.
Petruccio, I shall be your ben venuto.
