Thank you, good lord Archbishop. What is her name? Stand up, lord. Cranmer rises (To the child) With this kiss take my blessing— He kisses the child God protect thee, Into whose hand I give thy life. KING HENRY (to Cranmer, old Duchess, and Marchioness) My noble gossips, you’ve been too prodigal. I thank ye heartily. So shall this lady, When she has so much English.
