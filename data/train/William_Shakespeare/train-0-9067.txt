Knock within
Knock, knock, knock. Who’s there, i‘th’ name of

Knock, knock. Who’s there, in th‘other devil’s name?

Knock within
Knock, knock, knock. Who’s there? ’Faith, here’s an

that go the primrose way to th’everlasting bonfire.
Knock within
Anon, anon!
He opens the gate
I pray you remember the porter.
