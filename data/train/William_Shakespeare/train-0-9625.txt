I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,
Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry,
Till honour be bought up, and no sword worn
But one to dance with. By heaven, I’ll steal away. FIRST LORD DUMAINE There’s honour in the theft. Commit it, Count. SECOND LORD DUMAINE I am your accessary. And so, farewell.
