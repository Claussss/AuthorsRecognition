But she with vehement prayers urgeth still
Under what colour he commits this ill. Thus he replies: â€˜The colour in thy face,
That even for anger makes the lily pale
And the red rose blush at her own disgrace,
Shall plead for me and tell my loving tale.
Under that colour am I come to scale Thy never-conquered fort. The fault is thine,
For those thine eyes betray thee unto mine.
