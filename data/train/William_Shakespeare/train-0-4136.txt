KING PHILIP Thy rage shall burn thee up, and thou shalt turn 270
To ashes ere our blood shall quench that fire.
Look to thyself, thou art in jeopardy. No more than he that threats.—To arms let’s hie! Exeunt severally 
3.2

Some airy devil hovers in the sky
And pours down mischief. Austria’s head lie there,
While Philip breathes.
