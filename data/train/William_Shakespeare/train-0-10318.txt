Noble tribunes, It is the humane way. The other course
Will prove too bloody, and the end of it
Unknown to the beginning. Noble Menenius, Be you then as the people’s officer.
(To the Citizens) Masters, lay down your weapons. Go not home. Meet on the market-place. (To Menenius) We’ll attend
you there,
Where if you bring not Martius, we’ll proceed
In our first way.
