Some merry mocking lord, belike-isâ€™t so? They say so most that most his humours know. Such short-lived wits do wither as they grow.
Who are the rest? The young Dumaine, a well-accomplished youth,
Of all that virtue love for virtue loved.
Most power to do most harm, least knowing ill,
For he hath wit to make an ill shape good,
And shape to win grace, though he had no wit.
I saw him at the Duke Alen
And much too little of that good I saw
Is my report to his great worthiness.
