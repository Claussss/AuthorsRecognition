You know that’s not my question: but how long
Hath this shag fleece hung dangling on thy head? FALKNER How long, my lord? Why, sometimes thus long, sometimes lower, as the Fates and humours please. So quick, sir, with me, ha? I see, good fellow,
Thou lovest plain dealing. Sirrah, tell me now
When were you last at barber’s? How long time
Have you upon your head worn this shag hair?
