LUCIO He was drunk then, my lord, it can be no better. DUKE For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too. LUCIO Well, my lord. This is no witness for Lord Angelo. MARIANA Now I come to’t, my lord. She that accuses him of fornication
In self-same manner doth accuse my husband,
And charges him, my lord, with such a time
When I’ll depose I had him in mine arms
With all th’effect of love.
