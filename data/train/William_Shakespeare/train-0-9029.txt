MACBETH (aside) Glamis, and Thane of Cawdor. The greatest is behind. (To Ross and Angus) Thanks for
your pains. (To Banquo) Do you not hope your children shall be kings
When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me
Promised no less to them? That, trusted home, Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,
Besides the thane of Cawdor. But ’tis strange,
And oftentimes to win us to our harm
The instruments of darkness tell us truths,
Win us with honest trifles to betray’s
In deepest consequence.
(To Ross and Angus) Cousins, a word, I pray you.
