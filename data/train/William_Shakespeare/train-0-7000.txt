FESTE So I do, madonna, but to read his right wits is to read thus. Therefore perpend, my princess, and give ear. OLIVIA (to Fabian) Read it you, sirrah. Feste gives the letter to Fabian FABIAN (reads) â€˜By the Lord, madam, you wrong me, and the world shall know it. Though you have put me into darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over me, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as your ladyship. I have your own letter that induced me to the semblance I put on, with the which I doubt not but to do myself much right or you much shame. Think of me as you please. I leave my duty a little unthought of, and speak out of my injury.
