OTHELLO I cry you mercy then. I took you for that cunning whore of Venice
That married with Othello. (Calling) You, mistress,
That have the office opposite to Saint Peter
And keeps the gate of hell, Enter Emilia you, you, ay, you.
We ha’ done our course. (Giving money) There’s
money for your pains.
I pray you, turn the key and keep our counsel.
