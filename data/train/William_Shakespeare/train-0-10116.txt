You have heard me say, when I did fly from Tyre,
I left behind an ancient substitute.
Can you remember what I called the man? I have named him oft. THAISA ’Twas Helicanus then. PERICLES Still confirmation. Embrace him, dear Thaisa; this is he.
Now do I long to hear how you were found,
How possibly preserved, and who to thank—
Besides the gods—for this great miracle.
