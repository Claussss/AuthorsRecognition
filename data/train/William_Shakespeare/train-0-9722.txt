At the ’Saint Francis’ here beside the port. Is this the way? Ay, marry, is’t. Sound of a march, far off Hark you, they come this way. If you will tarry,
Holy pilgrim, but till the troops come by,
I will conduct you where you shall be lodged,
The rather for I think I know your hostess
As ample as myself.
