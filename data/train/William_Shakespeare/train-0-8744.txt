EDMUND In wisdom I should ask thy name, But since thy outside looks so fair and warlike,
And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,
My right of knighthood I disdain and spurn.
Here do I toss those treasons to thy head,
With the hell-hated lie oâ€™erturn thy heart,
Which, for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise,
This sword of mine shall give them instant way
Where they shall rest for ever. Trumpets, speak!
