Whate’er I read to her, I’ll plead for you
As for my patron, stand you so assured,
As firmly as yourself were still in place—
Yea, and perhaps with more successful words
Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir. O this learning, what a thing it is! GRUMIO (aside) O this woodcock, what an ass it is! PETRUCCIO Peace, sirrah.
