What’s here?—a letter that she loves the knight of Tyre?
’Tis the King’s subtlety to have my life. He prostrates himself at the King’s feet O, seek not to entrap me, gracious lord,
A stranger and distressed gentleman
That never aimed so high to love your daughter,
But bent all offices to honour her.
Never did thought of mine levy offence,
Nor never did my actions yet commence
A deed might gain her love or your displeasure.
