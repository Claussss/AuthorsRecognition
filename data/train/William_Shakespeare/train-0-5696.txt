True. Those that were your fatherâ€™s enemies
Have steeped their galls in honey, and do serve you
With hearts create of duty and of zeal. We therefore have great cause of thankfulness,
And shall forget the office of our hand
Sooner than quittance of desert and merit,
According to their weight and worthiness.
