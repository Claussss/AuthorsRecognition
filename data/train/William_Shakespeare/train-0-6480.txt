KING CLAUDIUS How may we try it further? You know sometimes he walks four hours together
Here in the lobby. QUEEN GERTRUDE So he does indeed. At such a time I’ll loose my daughter to him.
(To Claudius) Be you and I behind an arras then.
Mark the encounter. If he love her not,
And be not from his reason fall’n thereon,
Let me be no assistant for a state,
But keep a farm and carters.
