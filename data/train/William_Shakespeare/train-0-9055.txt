MACBETH A friend. What, sir, not yet at rest? The Kingâ€™s a-bed.
He hath been in unusual pleasure, and
Sent forth great largesse to your offices.
This diamond he greets your wife withal
By the name of most kind hostess, and shut up
In measureless content. Being unprepared Our will became the servant to defect,
Which else should free have wrought.
