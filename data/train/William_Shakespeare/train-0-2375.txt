His high-pitched thoughts, that meaner men should vaunt
That golden hap which their superiors want. But some untimely thought did instigate
His all-too-timeless speed, if none of those.
His honour, his affairs, his friends, his state
Neglected all, with swift intent he goes
To quench the coal which in his liver glows.
