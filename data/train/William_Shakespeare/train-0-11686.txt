Look out there, some of ye. Exit a servant CARDINAL WOLSEY What warlike voice, And to what end is this? Nay, ladies, fear not.
By all the laws of war you’re privileged. Enter the servant LORD CHAMBERLAIN How now—what is’t? A noble troop of strangers, For so they seem. They’ve left their barge and landed,
And hither make as great ambassadors
From foreign princes.
