Beâ€™t their comfort We are coming thither. Gracious England hath
Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;
An older and a better soldier none
That Christendom gives out. Would I could answer This comfort with the like. But I have words
That would be howled out in the desert air
Where hearing should not latch them.
