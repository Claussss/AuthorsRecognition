I am a feather for each wind that blows.
Shall I live on, to see this bastard kneel
And call me father? Better burn it now
Than curse it then. But be it. Let it live.
It shall not neither.
(To Antigonus) You, sir, come you hither,
You that have been so tenderly officious
With Lady Margery your midwife there,
To save this bastard’s life—for ’tis a bastard,
So sure as this beard’s grey. What will you adventure
To save this brat’s life?
