Madam, an if my brother had my shape,
And I had his, Sir Robert’s his like him,
And if my legs were two such riding-rods, 140
My arms such eel-skins stuffed, my face so thin
That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose
Lest men should say ‘Look where three-farthings
goes!’,
And, to his shape, were heir to all this land,
Would I might never stir from off this place.
I would give it every foot to have this face;
It would not be Sir Nob in any case.
