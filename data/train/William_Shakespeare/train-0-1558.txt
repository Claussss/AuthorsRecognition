Peace be amongst them if they turn to us;
Else, ruin combat with their palaces! Enter a Scout Success unto our valiant general,
And happiness to his accomplices. What tidings send our scouts? I prithee speak. The English army, that divided was
Into two parties, is now conjoined in one,
And means to give you battle presently.
