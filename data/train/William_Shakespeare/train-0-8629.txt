LEAR Make no noise, make no noise. Draw the curtains. So, so, so. We’ll go to supper i’th’ morning. So, so, so. He sleeps. Enter the Duke of Gloucester GLOUCESTER (to Kent) Come hither, friend. Where is the King my master? Here, sir, but trouble him not; his wits are gone. Good friend, I prithee take him in thy arms.
I have o’erheard a plot of death upon him.
There is a litter ready. Lay him in’t
And drive towards Dover, friend, where thou shalt meet
Both welcome and protection. Take up thy master.
If thou shouldst dally half an hour, his life,
With thine and all that offer to defend him,
Stand in assured loss. Take up, take up,
And follow me, that will to some provision
Give thee quick conduct.
