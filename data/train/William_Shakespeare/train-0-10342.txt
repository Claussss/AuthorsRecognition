How, traitor? MENENIUS Nay, temperatety—your promise. The fires i‘th’ lowest hell fold in the people!
Call me their traitor, thou injurious tribune?
Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,
In thy hands clutched as many millions, in
Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say
‘Thou liest’ unto thee with a voice as free
As I do pray the gods.
SICINIUS Mark you this, people?
ALL 
SICINIUS Peace!
