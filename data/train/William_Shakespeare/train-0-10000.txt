CERIMON I held it ever Virtue and cunning were endowments greater
Than nobleness and riches. Careless heirs
May the two latter darken and dispend,
But immortality attends the former,
Making a man a god. ‘Tis known I ever
Have studied physic, through which secret art,
By turning o’er authorities, I have,
Together with my practice, made familiar
To me and to my aid the blest infusions
That dwells in vegetives, in metals, stones,
And so can speak of the disturbances
That nature works, and of her cures, which doth
give me
A more content and cause of true delight
Than to be thirsty after tott’ring honour,
Or tie my pleasure up in silken bags
To glad the fool and death.
