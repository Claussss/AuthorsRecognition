EARL OF WARWICK (aside) How shall I enter in this graceless errand?
I must not call her child, for where’s the father
That will in such a suit seduce his child?
Then ‘wife of Salisbury’—shall I so begin?
No, he’s my friend, and where is found the friend
That will do friendship such endamagement?
(To the Countess) Neither my daughter, nor my dear friend’s wife,
I am not Warwick, as thou think‘st I am,
But an attorney from the court of hell,
That thus have housed my spirit in his form
To do a message to thee from the King:
‘The mighty King of England dotes on thee:
He that hath power to take away thy life
Hath power to take thy honour. Then consent
To pawn thine honour rather than thy life;
Honour is often lost and got again,
But life, once gone, hath no recovery.
The sun that withers hay doth nourish grass,
The King that would distain thee, will advance thee.
The poets write that great Achilles’ spear
Could heal the wound it made; the moral is,
What mighty men misdo they can amend.
The lion doth become his bloody jaws
And grace his foragement by being mild
When vassal fear lies trembling at his feet.
The King will, in his glory, hide thy shame,
And those that gaze on him, to find out thee,
Will lose their eyesight looking in the sun.
What can one drop of poison harm the sea
Whose hugy vastures can digest the ill
And make it lose his operation?
The King’s great name will temper thy misdeeds,
And give the bitter potion of reproach
A sugared, sweet and most delicious taste.
Besides, it is no harm to do the thing
Which, without shame, could not be left undone.’
Thus have I, in his majesty’s behalf,
Apparelled sin in virtuous sentences,
And dwell upon thy answer in his suit.
