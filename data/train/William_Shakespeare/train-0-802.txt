Eleanor, the law, thou seest, hath judged thee;
I cannot justify whom the law condemns. Exit the Duchess, guarded Mine eyes are full of tears, my heart of grief.
Ah, Humphrey, this dishonour in thine age
Will bring thy head with sorrow to the grave.
(To King Henry)
I beseech your majesty, give me leave to go.
Sorrow would solace, and mine age would ease.
