And stay, good Nurse, behind the abbey wall.
Within this hour my man shall be with thee
And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,
Which to the high topgallant of my joy
Must be my convoy in the secret night.
Farewell. Be trusty, and Iâ€™ll quit thy pains.
Farewell. Commend me to thy mistress. Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
