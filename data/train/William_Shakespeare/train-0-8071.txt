MARIANA kneeling before the Duke As there comes light from heaven, and words from
breath,
As there is sense in truth, and truth in virtue,
I am affianced this man’s wife, as strongly
As words could make up vows. And, my good lord,
But Tuesday night last gone, in’s garden-house,
He knew me as a wife. As this is true,
Let me in safety raise me from my knees,
Or else forever be confix
A marble monument.
