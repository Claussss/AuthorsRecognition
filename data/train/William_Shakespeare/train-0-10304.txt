Into destruction cast him. Aediles, seize him. ALL THE CITIZENS Yield, Martius, yield. Hear me one word. Beseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word. AEDILES Peace, peace! MENENIUS (to the tribunes) Be that you seem, truly your country’s friend,
And temp’rately proceed to what you would
Thus violently redress.
