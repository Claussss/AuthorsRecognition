She gives them flowers I should leave grazing were I of your flock,
And only live by gazing. You’d be so lean that blasts of January
Would blow you through and through.
(To Florizel) Now, my fair‘st friend,
I would I had some flowers o’th’ spring that might
Become your time of day; (to Mopsa and Dorcas) and
yours, and yours,
That wear upon your virgin branches yet
Your maidenheads growing. O Proserpina,
For the flowers now that, frighted, thou letst fall
From Dis’s wagon!-daffodils,
That come before the swallow dares, and take
The winds of March with beauty; violets, dim,
But sweeter than the lids of Juno’s eyes
Or Cytherea’s breath; pale primroses,
That die unmarried ere they can behold
Bright Phoebus in his strength—a malady
Most incident to maids; bold oxlips, and
The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,
The flower-de-luce being one. O, these I lack,
To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,
To strew him o‘er and o’er.
