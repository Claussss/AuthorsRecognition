LUCIO Sir, my name is Lucio, well known to the Duke. DUKE He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to report you. LUCIO I fear you not. DUKE O, you hope the Duke will return no more, or you imagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed I can do you little harm; you’ll forswear this again. LUCIO I’ll be hanged first. Thou art deceived in me, friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if Claudio die tomorrow or no?
