BASTARD aside That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death
Out of his rags. Here’s a large mouth, indeed,
That spits forth Death and mountains, rocks and seas,
Talks as familiarly of roaring lions 460
As maids of thirteen do of puppy-dogs.
What cannoneer begot this lusty blood?
He speaks plain cannon: fire, and smoke, and bounce;
He gives the bastinado with his tongue;
Our ears are cudgelled; not a word of his 465
But buffets better than a fist of France.
Zounds! I was never so bethumped with words
Since I first called my brother’s father Dad.
