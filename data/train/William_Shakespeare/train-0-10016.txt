Madam, if this you purpose as ye speak,
Diana’s temple is not distant far,
Where till your date expire you may abide.
Moreover, if you please a niece of mine
Shall there attend you. My recompense is thanks, that’s all,
Yet my good will is great, though the gift small. Exeunt Sc. 15
Enter Gower Imagine Pericles arrived at Tyre,
Welcomed and settled to his own desire.
His woeful queen we leave at Ephesus,
Unto Diana there ’s a votaress.
