Call you this gamut? Tut, I like it not.
Old fashions please me best. I am not so nice
To change true rules for odd inventions. Enter a Messenger Mistress, your father prays you leave your books
And help to dress your sisterâ€™s chamber up.
You know tomorrow is the wedding day. Farewell, sweet masters both. I must be gone.
