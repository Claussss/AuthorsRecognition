Enter Orlando bearing Adam DUKE SENIOR Welcome. Set down your venerable burden
And let him feed. ORLANDO I thank you most for him. ADAM So had you need; I scarce can speak to thank you for myself. DUKE SENIOR Welcome. Fall to. I will not trouble you
As yet to question you about your fortunes.
Give us some music, and, good cousin, sing.
