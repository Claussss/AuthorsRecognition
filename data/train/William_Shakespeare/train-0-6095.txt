Antony and Octavius meet Brutus and Cassius Words before blows: is it so, countrymen? Not that we love words better, as you do. Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius. In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words.
Witness the hole you made in Caesar’s heart,
Crying ‘Long live, hail Caesar’.
