Enter Seleucus SELEUCUS Here, madam. CLEOPATRA (to Caesar) This is my treasurer. Let him speak, my lord,
Upon his peril, that I have reserved
To myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus. Madam, I had rather seal my lips
Than to my peril speak that which is not. CLEOPATRA What have I kept back? Enough to purchase what you have made known.
