They speak aside CAMILLO (aside) What I do next shall be to tell the King
Of this escape, and whither they are bound;
Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail
To force him after, in whose company
I shall re-view Sicilia, for whose sight
I have a woman’s longing. Fortune speed us! Thus we set on, Camillo, to th’ seaside.
