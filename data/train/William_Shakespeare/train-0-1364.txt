Thou hast astonished me with thy high terms.
Only this proof I’ll of thy valour make:
In single combat thou shalt buckle with me.
An if thou vanquishest, thy words are true;
Otherwise, I renounce all confidence. I am prepared. Here is my keen-edged sword,
Decked with five flower-de-luces on each side—
The which at Touraine, in Saint Katherine’s churchyard,
Out of a great deal of old iron I chose forth.
