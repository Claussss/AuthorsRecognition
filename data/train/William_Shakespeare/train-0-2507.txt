To creatures stern sad tunes to change their kinds.
Since men prove beasts, let beasts bear gentle minds.â€™ As the poor frighted deer that stands at gaze,
Wildly determining which way to fly,
Or one encompassed with a winding maze,
That cannot tread the way out readily,
So with herself is she in mutiny,
