QUEEN ELEANOR (to Arthur) Come to thy grandam, child. CONSTANCE (to Arthur) Do, child, go to it grandam, child. 160
Give grandam kingdom, and it grandam will
Give it a plum, a cherry, and a fig.
There’s a good grandam. ARTHUR Good my mother, peace. I would that I were low laid in my grave.
I am not worth this coil that’s made for me. 165
