GHOST OF LADY ANNE (to Richard) Richard, thy wife, that wretched Anne thy wife,
That never slept a quiet hour with thee,
Now fills thy sleep with perturbations.
Tomorrow in the battle think on me,
And fall thy edgeless sword. Despair and die.
(To Richmond) Thou quiet soul, sleep thou a quiet sleep.
Dream of success and happy victory.
