Good morrow to thee, gentle Apemantus. APEMANTUS
Till I be gentle, stay thou for thy good morrow—
When thou art Timon’s dog, and these knaves
honest. Why dost thou call them knaves? Thou know’st
them not. APEMANTUS Are they not Athenians? APEMANTUS Then I repent not. JEWELLER You know me, Apemantus?
