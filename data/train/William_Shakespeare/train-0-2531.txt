The more she saw the blood his cheeks replenish,
The more she thought he spied in her some blemish. But long she thinks till he return again,
And yet the duteous vassal scarce is gone.
The weary time she cannot entertain,
For now â€™tis stale to sigh, to weep, and groan.
So woe hath wearied woe, moan tired moan,
