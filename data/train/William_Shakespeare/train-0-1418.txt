Enter Messenger and Lord Talbot Madam, according as your ladyship desired,
By message craved, so is Lord Talbot come. And he is welcome. What, is this the man? Madam, it is. COUNTESS Is this the scourge of France? Is this the Talbot, so much feared abroad
That with his name the mothers still their babes?
I see report is fabulous and false.
I thought I should have seen some Hercules,
A second Hector, for his grim aspect
And large proportion of his strong-knit limbs.
Alas, this is a child, a seely dwarf.
It cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp
Should strike such terror to his enemies.
