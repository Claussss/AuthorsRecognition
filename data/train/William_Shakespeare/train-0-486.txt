GREMIO So said, so done, is well. Hortensio, have you told him all her faults? I know she is an irksome brawling scold.
If that be all, masters, I hear no harm. No, sayst me so, friend? What countryman? Born in Verona, old Antonioâ€™s son.
My father dead, his fortune lives for me,
And I do hope good days and long to see.
