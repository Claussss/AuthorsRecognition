YORK Thou fond, mad woman, Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy?
A dozen of them here have ta’en the sacrament,
And interchangeably set down their hands
To kill the King at Oxford. DUCHESS OF YORK He shall be none. We’ll keep him here, then what is that to him? Away, fond woman! Were he twenty times my son
I would appeach him.
