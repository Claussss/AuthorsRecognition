COUNTESS OF SALISBURY A little while, my gracious sovereign, stay,
And let the power of a mighty king
Honour our roof. My husband, in the wars,
When he shall hear it, will triumph for joy.
Then, dear my liege, now niggard not thy state;
Being at the wall, enter our homely gate. KING EDWARD Pardon me, Countess, I will come no near:
I dreamed tonight of treason, and I fear.
