PISTOL Good. FLUELLEN Ay, leeks is good. Hold you, there is a groat to heal your pate. PISTOL Me, a groat? FLUELLEN Yes, verity, and in truth you shall take it, or I have another leek in my pocket which you shall eat. I take thy groat in earnest of revenge. FLUELLEN If I owe you anything, I will pay you in cudgels. You shall be a woodmonger, and buy nothing of me but cudgels. God b’wi’ you, and keep you, and heal your pate. Exit
