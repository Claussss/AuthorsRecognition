Exeunt into the cave 3.7
Enter two Roman Senators, and Tribunes 
FIRST SENATOR This is the tenor of the Emperor’s writ:
That since the common men are now in action
‘Gainst the Pannonians and Dalmatians,
And that the legions now in Gallia are
Full weak to undertake our wars against
The fall’n-off Britons, that we do incite
The gentry to this business. He creates
Lucius pro-consul, and to you the tribunes,
For this immediate levy, he commends
His absolute commission. Long live Caesar!
