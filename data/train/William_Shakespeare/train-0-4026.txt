PHILOSTRATE Here mighty Theseus. Say, what abridgement have you for this evening?
What masque, what music? How shall we beguile
The lazy time if not with some delight? PHILOSTRATE There is a brief how many sports are ripe. 25
Make choice of which your highness will see first. ‘The battle with the centaurs to be sung
By an Athenian eunuch to the harp.’
We’ll none of that. That have I told my love
In glory of my kinsman Hercules. 30
‘The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals
Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage.’
That is an old device, and it was played
When I from Thebes came last a conquerer.
‘The thrice-three Muses mourning for the death 35
Of learning, late deceased in beggary.’
That is some satire, keen and critical,
Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.
‘A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus
And his love Thisby.’ ’Tedious’ and ‘brief’? 40
