An’t please your honour, We are but men, and what so many may do,
Not being torn a-pieces, we have done.
An army cannot rule ’em. LORD CHAMBERLAIN As I live, If the King blame me for’t, I’ll lay ye all
By th’ heels, and suddenly—and on your heads
Clap round fines for neglect. You’re lazy knaves,
And here ye lie baiting of bombards when
Ye should do service.
