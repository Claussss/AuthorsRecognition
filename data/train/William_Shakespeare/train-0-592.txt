See how they kiss and court. Signor Lucentio,
Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow
Never to woo her more, but do forswear her
As one unworthy all the former favours
That I have fondly flattered her withal. And here I take the like unfeigned oath
Never to marry with her, though she would entreat.
Fie on her, see how beastly she doth court him!
