KING HENRY (to York) And shall I stand and thou sit in my throne? It must and shall be so—content thyself. WARWICK (to King Henry) Be Duke of Lancaster, let him be king. WESTMORLAND He is both king and Duke of Lancaster—
And that, the Lord of Westmorland shall maintain. And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget
That we are those which chased you from the field,
And slew your fathers, and, with colours spread,
Marched through the city to the palace gates.
