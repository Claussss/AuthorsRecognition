Is not your name, sir, called Antipholus?
And is not that your bondman Dromio? DROMIO OF EPHESUS Within this hour I was his bondman, sir,
But he, I thank him, gnawed in two my cords.
Now am I Dromio, and his man, unbound. I am sure you both of you remember me. DROMIO OF EPHESUS Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you;
For lately we were bound as you are now.
You are not Pinchâ€™s patient, are you, sir?
