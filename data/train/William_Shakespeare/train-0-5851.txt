FLUELLEN Yes, in my conscience, he did us great good. KING HARRY Do we all holy rites: Let there be sung Non nobis and Te Deum,
The dead with charity enclosed in clay;
And then to Calais, and to England then,
Where ne’er from France arrived more-happy men.
Exeunt  5.0
Enter Chorus Vouchsafe to those that have not read the story
That I may prompt them—and of such as have,
I humbly pray them to admit th‘excuse
Of time, of numbers, and due course of things,
Which cannot in their huge and proper life
Be here presented. Now we bear the King
Toward Calais. Grant him there; there seen,
Heave him away upon your winged thoughts
Athwart the sea. Behold, the English beach
Pales-in the flood, with men, maids, wives, and boys,
Whose shouts and claps out-voice the deep-mouthed
sea,
Which like a mighty whiffler fore the King
Seems to prepare his way. So let him land,
And solemnly see him set on to London.
So swift a pace hath thought, that even now
You may imagine him upon Blackheath,
Where that his lords desire him to have borne
His bruised helmet and his bended sword
Before him through the city; he forbids it,
Being free from vainness and self-glorious pride,
Giving full trophy, signal, and ostent
Quite from himself, to God. But now behold,
In the quick forge and working-house of thought,
How London doth pour out her citizens.
The Mayor and all his brethren, in best sort,
Like to the senators of th’antique Rome
With the plebeians swarming at their heels,
Go forth and fetch their conqu’ring Caesar in—
As, by a lower but high-loving likelihood,
Were now the General of our gracious Empress—
As in good time he may—from Ireland coming,
Bringing rebellion broached on his sword,
How many would the peaceful city quit
To welcome him! Much more, and much more cause,
Did they this Harry. Now in London place him;
As yet the lamentation of the French
Invites the King of England’s stay at home.
The Emperor’s coming in behalf of France,
To order peace between them
