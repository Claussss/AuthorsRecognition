Fall deep in love with thee, and her great charms Misguide thy opposers’ swords! Bold gentleman, Prosperity be thy page. MARTIUS Thy friend no less Than those she placeth highest. So farewell. LARTIUS Thou worthiest Martius! Exit Martius Go sound thy trumpet in the market-place.
Call thither all the officers o’th’ town,
Where they shall know our mind. Away.
