PRINCE JOHN (to Westmorland) Go, my lord, And let our army be discharged too. Exit Westmorland (To the Archbishop) And, good my lord, so please you,
let our trains
March by us, that we may peruse the men
We should have coped withal. ARCHBISHOP OF YORK Go, good Lord Hastings, And ere they be dismissed, let them march by.
