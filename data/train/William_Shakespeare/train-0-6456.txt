Well said, old mole. Canst work i’th’ earth so fast?
A worthy pioneer.—Once more remove, good friends. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange! And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
Than are dreamt of in our philosophy. But come,
Here as before, never, so help you mercy,
How strange or odd soe‘er I bear myself—
As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
To put an antic disposition on—
That you at such time seeing me never shall,
With arms encumbered thus, or this headshake,
Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase
As ‘Well, we know’ or ‘We could an if we would’,
Or ‘If we list to speak’, or ‘There be, an if they might’,
Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
That you know aught of me—this not to do,
So grace and mercy at your most need help you, swear.
GHOST (under the stage) Swear.
