KING EDWARD But Warwick’s king is Edward’s prisoner,
And, gallant Warwick, do but answer this:
What is the body when the head is off? RICHARD OF GLOUCESTER Alas, that Warwick had no more forecast,
But whiles he thought to steal the single ten,
The king was slyly fingered from the deck.
To Warwick
And ten to one you’ll meet him in the Tower.
