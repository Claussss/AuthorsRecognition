KING HARRY Your reproof is something too round. I should be angry with you, if the time were convenient. WILLIAMS Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live. KING HARRY I embrace it. WILLIAM How shall I know thee again? KING HARRY Give me any gage of thine, and I will wear it in my bonnet. Then if ever thou darest acknowledge it, I will make it my quarrel.
