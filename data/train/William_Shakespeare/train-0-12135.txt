Here the hind vanishes under the altar and in the place ascends a rose tree having one rose upon it (To her women) See what our general of ebbs and flows
Out from the bowels of her holy altar,
With sacred act, advancesâ€”but one rose!
If well inspired, this battle shall confound
Both these brave knights, and I a virgin flower
Must grow alone, unplucked.
