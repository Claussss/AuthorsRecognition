Ay, and perversely she persevers so.
What might we do to make the girl forget
The love of Valentine, and love Sir Thurio? The best way is to slander Valentine
With falsehood, cowardice, and poor descent,
Three things that women highly hold in hate. Ay, but sheâ€™ll think that it is spoke in hate. Ay, if his enemy deliver it.
Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken
By one whom she esteemeth as his friend.
