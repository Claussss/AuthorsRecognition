Opinion, that so sticks on Martius, shall
 Of his demerits rob Cominius. Half all Cominius’ honours are to Martius,
 Though Martius earned them not; and all his faults
 To Martius shall be honours, though indeed
 In aught he merit not. SICINIUS Let’s hence and hear How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,
More than his singularity, he goes
Upon this present action.
