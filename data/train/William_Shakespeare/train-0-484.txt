Grumio, mum. (Coming forward) God save you, Signor Gremio. And you are well met, Signor Hortensio.
Trow you whither I am going?
To Baptista Minola.
I promised to enquire carefully
About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca,
And by good fortune I have lighted well
On this young man, for learning and behaviour
Fit for her turn, well read in poetry
And other booksâ€”good ones, I warrant ye.
