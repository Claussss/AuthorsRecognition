CAPULET’S WIFE Fie, fie, what, are you mad? JULIET (kneeling) Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
Hear me with patience but to speak a word. Hang thee, young baggage, disobedient wretch!
I tell thee what: get thee to church o’ Thursday,
Or never after look me in the face.
Speak not, reply not, do not answer me.
