AUMERLE (kneeling) Unto my motherâ€™s prayers I bend my knee. YORK (kneeling) Against them both my true joints bended be.
Ill mayst thou thrive if thou grant any grace. DUCHESS OF YORK Pleads he in earnest? Look upon his face.
His eyes do drop no tears, his prayers are in jest.
His words come from his mouth; ours from our
breast.
He prays but faintly, and would be denied;
We pray with heart and soul, and all beside.
His weary joints would gladly rise, I know;
Our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow.
His prayers are full of false hypocrisy;
Ours of true zeal and deep integrity.
Our prayers do outpray his; then let them have
That mercy which true prayer ought to have.
