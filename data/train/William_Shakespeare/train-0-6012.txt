Your voice shall be as strong as any manâ€™s
In the disposing of new dignities. Only be patient till we have appeased
The multitude, beside themselves with fear,
And then we will deliver you the cause
Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,
Have thus proceeded. ANTONY I doubt not of your wisdom.
