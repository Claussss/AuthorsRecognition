KING CLAUDIUS My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
Words without thoughts never to heaven go. 3.4
Enter Queen Gertrude and Polonius A will come straight. Look you lay home to him.
Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
And that your grace hath screened and stood between
Much heat and him. I’ll silence me e’en here.
Pray you be round with him.
