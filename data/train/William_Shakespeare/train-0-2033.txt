LORD HASTINGS My lord, I hold my life as dear as you do yours,
And never in my days, I do protest,
Was it so precious to me as ‘tis now.
Think you, but that I know our state secure,
I would be so triumphant as I am? The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London,
Were jocund, and supposed their states were sure,
And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;
But yet you see how soon the day o’ercast.
This sudden stab of rancour I misdoubt.
Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward.
What, shall we toward the Tower? The day is spent.
