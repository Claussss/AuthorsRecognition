Exeunt Capulet and his wife at one door, Paris at another door 
3.5
Enter Romeo and Juliet aloft with the ladder of cords Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
That pierced the fear-full hollow of thine ear.
Nightly she sings on yon pomâ€™granate tree.
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
