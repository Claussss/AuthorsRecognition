Enter three Gentlemen O, here he is. Lay hands upon him, sirs.
(To Lear) Your most dear— No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am e’en
The natural fool of fortune. Use me well.
You shall have ransom. Let me have a surgeon;
I am cut to the brains. LEAR No seconds? All myself? Why, this would make a man a man of salt,
To use his eyes for garden water-pots,
Ay, and laying autumn’s dust.
