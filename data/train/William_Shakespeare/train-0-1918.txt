RICHARD GLOUCESTER Good counsel, marry!—Learn it, learn it, Marquis. It touches you, my lord, as much as me. RICHARD GLOUCESTER Ay, and much more; but I was born so high.
Our eyrie buildeth in the cedar’s top,
And dallies with the wind, and scorns the sun. QUEEN MARGARET And turns the sun to shade. Alas, alas!
Witness my son, now in the shade of death,
Whose bright outshining beams thy cloudy wrath
Hath in eternal darkness folded up.
Your eyrie buildeth in our eyrie’s nest.—
O God that seest it, do not suffer it;
As it was won with blood, lost be it so.
