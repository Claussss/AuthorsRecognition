Injurious Margaret. PRINCE EDWARD And why not ‘Queen’? Because thy father Henry did usurp,
And thou no more art prince than she is queen. Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,
Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain;
And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,
Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;
And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,
Who by his prowess conquered all France.
From these our Henry lineally descends.
