MARIA My name is Mary, sir. SIR ANDREW Good Mistress Mary Accost. SIR TOBY You mistake, knight. ’Accost’ is front her, board her, woo her, assail her. SIR ANDREW By my troth, I would not undertake her in this company. Is that the meaning of ‘accost’? MARIA Fare you well, gentlemen. SIR TOBY An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst never draw sword again.
