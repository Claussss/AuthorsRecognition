ANDROMACHE aside Cassandra, call my father to persuade. Exit Cassandra No, faith, young Troilus. Doff thy harness, youth.
I am today i’th’ vein of chivalry.
Let grow thy sinews till their knots be strong,
And tempt not yet the brushes of the war.
Unarm thee, go—and doubt thou not, brave boy,
I’ll stand today for thee and me and Troy.
