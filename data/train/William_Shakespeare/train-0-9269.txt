Quarrel no more, but be prepared to know
The purposes I bear, which are or cease
As you shall give th’advice. By the fire
That quickens Nilus’ slime, I go from hence
Thy soldier-servant, making peace or war
As thou affects. Cut my lace, Charmian, come. But let it be. I am quickly ill and well;
So Antony loves.
