Miranda sleeps Come away, servant, come! I am ready now.
Approach, my Ariel, come! Enter Ariel All hail, great master, grave sir, hail. I come
To answer thy best pleasure. Beâ€™t to fly,
To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride
On the curled clouds, to thy strong bidding task
Ariel and all his quality.
