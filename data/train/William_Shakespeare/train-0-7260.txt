Shall I, sweet lord, be bound to you so much,
After we part from Agamemnon’s tent,
To bring me thither? ULYSSES You shall command me, sir. As gentle tell me, of what honour was
This Cressida in Troy? Had she no lover there
That wails her absence? O sir, to such as boasting show their scars
A mock is due. Will you walk on, my lord?
She was beloved, she loved; she is, and doth.
But still sweet love is food for fortune’s tooth. Exeunt
