Therein do men from children nothing differ. I pray thee peace, I will be flesh and blood,
For there was never yet philosopher
That could endure the toothache patiently,
However they have writ the style of gods,
And made a pish at chance and sufferance. Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself.
Make those that do offend you suffer, too.
