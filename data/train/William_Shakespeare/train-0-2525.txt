Much like a press of people at a door
Throng her inventions, which shall go before. At last she thus begins: ‘Thou worthy lord
Of that unworthy wife that greeteth thee,
Health to thy person! Next, vouchsafe t’afford—
If ever, love, thy Lucrece thou wilt see—
Some present speed to come and visit me. So I commend me, from our house in grief;
My woes are tedious, though my words are brief.’
