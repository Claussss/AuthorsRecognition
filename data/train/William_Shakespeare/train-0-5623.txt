Enter Beatrice  Sweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I called thee? BEATRICE Yea, signor, and depart when you bid me. BENEDICK O, stay but till then. BEATRICE ‘Then’ is spoken. Fare you well now. And yet ere I go, let me go with that I came for, which is with knowing what hath passed between you and Claudio.
