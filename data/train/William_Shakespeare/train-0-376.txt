Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring. She offers Silvia a ring The more shame for him, that he sends it me;
For I have heard him say a thousand times
His Julia gave it him at his departure.
Though his false finger have profaned the ring,
Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong. JULIA She thanks you.
