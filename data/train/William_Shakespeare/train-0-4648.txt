Come, here’s the map. Shall we divide our right,
According to our threefold order ta’en? The Archdeacon hath divided it
Into three limits very equally.
England from Trent and Severn hitherto
By south and east is to my part assigned;
All westward-Wales beyond the Severn shore
And all the fertile land within that bound—
To Owain Glyndwr; (to Hotspur) and, dear coz, to you
The remnant northward lying off from Trent.
And our indentures tripartite are drawn,
Which, being seal
A business that this night may execute—
Tomorrow, cousin Percy, you and I 80
And my good lord of Worcester will set forth
To meet your father and the Scottish power,
As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury.
My father, Glynd
Nor shall we need his help these fourteen days.
Within that space you may have drawn together
Your tenants, friends, and neighbouring gentlemen.
