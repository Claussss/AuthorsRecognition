THIRD GENTLEMAN Among the crowd i’th’ Abbey, where a finger
Could not be wedged in more. I am stifled
With the mere rankness of their joy. SECOND GENTLEMAN You saw the ceremony? THIRD GENTLEMAN That I did. FIRST GENTLEMAN How Was it? THIRD GENTLEMAN Well worth the seeing. SECOND GENTLEMAN Good sir, speak it to us.
