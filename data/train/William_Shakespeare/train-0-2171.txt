Well, hie thee to thy lord. Commend me to him.
Tell him the Queen hath heartily consented
He should espouse Elizabeth her daughter.
My letter will resolve him of my mind.
Farewell. Exeunt severally 5.1
Enter the Duke of Buckingham with halberdiers, led by a Sheriff to execution 
BUCKINGHAM Will not King Richard let me speak with him?
