All ill come running in, all good keep out. SECOND WITCH By the pricking of my thumbs,
Something wicked this way comes.
Knock within
Open, locks, whoever knocks.
Enter Macbeth How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags,
What is’t you do? ALL THE WITCHES A deed without a name. I conjure you by that which you profess,
Howe’er you come to know it, answer me.
Though you untie the winds and let them fight
Against the churches, though the yeasty waves
Confound and swallow navigation up,
Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down,
Though castles topple on their warders’ heads,
Though palaces and pyramids do slope
Their heads to their foundations, though the treasure
Of nature’s germens tumble all together
Even till destruction sicken, answer me
To what I ask you.
