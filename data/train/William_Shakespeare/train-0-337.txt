And Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind
Because we know, on Valentine’s report,
You are already love’s firm votary,
And cannot soon revolt, and change your mind.
Upon this warrant shall you have access
Where you with Silvia may confer at large.
For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy,
And for your friend’s sake will be glad of you;
Where you may temper her, by your persuasion,
To hate young Valentine and love my friend.
