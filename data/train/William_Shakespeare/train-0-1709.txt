3.1
Enter the Judges, Tribunes, and Senators with Titus’ two sons, Martius and Quintus, bound, passing overthe stage to the place of execution, and Titus going before, pleading Hear me, grave fathers; noble Tribunes, stay.
For pity of mine age, whose youth was spent
In dangerous wars whilst you securely slept;
For all my blood in Rome’s great quarrel shed;
For all the frosty nights that I have watched,
And for these bitter tears which now you see
Filling the ag
Be pitiful to my condemned sons,
Whose souls is not corrupted as ’tis thought.
For two-and-twenty sons I never wept,
Because they died in honour’s lofty bed.
