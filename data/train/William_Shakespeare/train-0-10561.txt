I am as ignorant in that as you
In so entitling me, and no less honest
Than you are mad, which is enough, I’ll warrant,
As this world goes, to pass for honest. LEONTES (to Lords) Will you not push her out?
(To Antigonus) Give her the bastard. Thou dotard, thou art woman-tired, unroosted
By thy Dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard,
Take’t up, I say. Give’t to thy crone.
