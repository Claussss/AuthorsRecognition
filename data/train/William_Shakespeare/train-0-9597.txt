His good remembrance, sir, Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb.
So in approof lives not his epitaph
As in your royal speech. Would I were with him! He would always say—
Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words
He scattered not in ears, but grafted them
To grow there and to bear. ‘Let me not live’—
This his good melancholy oft began
On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,
When it was out—‘Let me not live’, quoth he,
‘After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff
Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses
All but new things disdain, whose judgements are
Mere fathers of their garments, whose constancies
Expire before their fashions.’ This he wished.
I after him do after him wish too,
Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,
I quickly were dissolv
To give some labourers room.
