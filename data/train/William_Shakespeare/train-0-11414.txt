Miranda sits You have often Begun to tell me what I am, but stopped
And left me to a bootless inquisition,
Concluding ‘Stay; not yet’. The hour’s now come. The very minute bids thee ope thine ear,
Obey, and be attentive. Canst thou remember
A time before we came unto this cell?
I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not
Out three years old.
