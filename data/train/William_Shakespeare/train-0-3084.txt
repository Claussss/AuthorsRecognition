Sweet health and fair desires consort your grace. Thy own wish wish I thee in every place. Exit with Longueville and Dumaine BIRON (to Rosaline) Lady, I will commend you to mine own heart. ROSALINE Pray you, do my commendations. I would be glad to see it. BIRON I would you heard it groan. ROSALINE Is the fool sick?
