Dost thou mock me? IAGO I mock you not, by heaven. Would you would bear your fortune like a man. There’s many a beast then in a populous city,
And many a civil monster. OTHELLO Did he confess it? IAGO Good sir, be a man. Think every bearded fellow that’s but yoked
May draw with you. There’s millions now alive
That nightly lie in those unproper beds
Which they dare swear peculiar. Your case is better.
O, ’tis the spite of hell, the fiend’s arch-mock,
To lip a wanton in a secure couch
And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know,
And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.
