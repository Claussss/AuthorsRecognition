LORENZO In such a night Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew,
And with an unthrift love did run from Venice
As far as Belmont. JESSICA In such a night Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well,
Stealing her soul with many vows of faith,
And neâ€™er a true one. LORENZO In such a night Did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew,
Slander her love, and he forgave it her.
