Enter Romeo Within the infant rind of this weak flower
Poison hath residence, and medicine power,
For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
Two such opposed kings encamp them still
In man as well as herbsâ€”grace and rude will;
And where the worser is predominant,
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
