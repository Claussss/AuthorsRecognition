GRAZIANO Signor Bassanio, hear me. If I do not put on a sober habit,
Talk with respect, and swear but now and then,
Wear prayer books in my pocket, look demurely—
Nay more, while grace is saying hood mine eyes 185
Thus with my hat, and sigh, and say ‘Amen’,
Use all the observance of civility,
Like one well studied in a sad ostent
To please his grandam, never trust me more.
