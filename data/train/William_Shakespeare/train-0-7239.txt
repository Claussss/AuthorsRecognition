AGAMEMNON Which way would Hector have it? He cares not; he’ll obey conditions. ’Tis done like Hector—but securely done,
A little proudly, and great deal disprising
The knight opposed. AENEAS If not Achilles, sir, What is your name? ACHILLES If not Achilles, nothing. Therefore Achilles. But whate’er, know this:
In the extremity of great and little,
Valour and pride excel themselves in Hector,
The one almost as infinite as all,
The other blank as nothing. Weigh him well,
And that which looks like pride is courtesy.
This Ajax is half made of Hector’s blood,
In love whereof half Hector stays at home.
Half heart, half hand, half Hector comes to seek
This blended knight, half Trojan and half Greek.
