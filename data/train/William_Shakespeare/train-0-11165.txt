Hark, hark, the lark at heaven gate sings,
And Phoebus gins arise,
His steeds to water at those springs
On chaticed flowers that lies,
And winking Mary-buds begin to ope their golden eyes;
With everything that pretty is, my lady sweet, arise,
Arise, arise! CLOTEN So, get you gone. If this penetrate I will consider your music the better; if it do not, it is a vice in her ears which horse hairs and calvesâ€™ guts nor the voice of unpaved eunuch to boot can never amend.
