KING EDWARD But they shall find that forged ground of theirs
To be but dusty heaps of brittle sand. COMTE D’ARTOIS Perhaps it will be thought a heinous thing
That I, a Frenchman, should discover this.
But heaven I call to record of my vows:
It is not hate nor any private wrong,
But love unto my country and the right
Provokes my tongue thus lavish in report.
You are the lineal watchman of our peace,
And Jean of Valois indirectly climbs.
What then should subjects but embrace their king?
Ah, wherein may our duty more be seen
Than striving to rebate a tyrant’s pride
And place thee, the true shepherd of our commonwealth?
