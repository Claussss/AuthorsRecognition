I fear too much rubbing. Goodnight, my good owl. Exeunt Boyet, Maria, and Catherine By my soul, a swain, a most simple clown.
Lord, Lord, how the ladies and I have put him down!
O’ my troth, most sweet jests, most incony vulgar wit,
When it comes so smoothly off, so obscenely, as it were, so fit!
Armado o‘th’ t’other side—O, a most dainty man!—
To see him walk before a lady and to bear her fan!
To see him kiss his hand, and how most sweetly a will swear,
And his page o’ t’other side, that handful of wit—
Ah heavens, it is a most pathetical nit!
