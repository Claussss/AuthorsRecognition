I will make fast the doors, and gild myself
With some more ducats, and be with you straight. Now, by my hood, a gentile, and no Jew. Beshrew me but I love her heartily,
For she is wise, if I can judge of her;
And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true;
And true she is, as she hath proved herself;
And therefore like herself, wise, fair, and true,
Shall she be placed in my constant soul.
