BRUTUS I heard him swear, Were he to stand for consul, never would he
Appear i’th’ market-place nor on him put
The napless vesture of humility,
Nor, showing, as the manner is, his wounds
To th’ people, beg their stinking breaths. SICINIUS ’Tis right. It was his word. O, he would miss it rather
Than carry it, but by the suit of the gentry to him,
And the desire of the nobles.
