Have I called thee friend? Yes, and have found me so. Why are you moved
thus?
Let me deal coldly with you. Am not I
Part of your blood, part of your soul? You have
told me
That I was Palamon and you were Arcite. PALAMON Yes. Am not I liable to those affections,
Those joys, griefs, angers, fears, my friend shall
suffer?
