I hear it now above me. PROSPERO (to Miranda) The fringed curtains of thine eye advance,
And say what thou seest yon. What is’t? A spirit? Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
It carries a brave form. But ’tis a spirit. No, wench, it eats and sleeps, and hath such senses
As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest
Was in the wreck, and but he’s something stained
With grief, that’s beauty’s canker, thou mightst call
him
A goodly person. He hath lost his fellows,
And strays about to find ’em.
