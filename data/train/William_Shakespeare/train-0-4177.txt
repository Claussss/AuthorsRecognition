This ‘once again’, but that your highness pleased,
Was once superfluous. You were crowned before,
And that high royalty was ne‘er plucked off,
The faiths of men ne’er stained with revolt;
Fresh expectation troubled not the land
With any longed-for change or better state. Therefore to be possessed with double pomp,
To guard a title that was rich before, 10
To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,
To throw a perfume on the violet,
To smooth the ice, or add another hue
Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light
To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,
Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.
