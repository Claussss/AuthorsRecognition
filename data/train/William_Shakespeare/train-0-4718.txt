Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt; and would to God
You were of our determination.
Some of us love you well, and even those some
Envy your great deservings and good name,
Because you are not of our quality,
But stand against us like an enemy. And God defend but still I should stand so,
So long as out of limit and true rule
You stand against anointed majesty.
