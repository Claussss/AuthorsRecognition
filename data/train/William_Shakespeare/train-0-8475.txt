Enter the Duke of Gloucester. Edmund reads a letter Kent banished thus, and France in choler parted,
And the King gone tonight, subscribed his power,
Confined to exhibition—all this done
Upon the gad?—Edmund, how now? What news? EDMUND So please your lordship, none. GLOUCESTER Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?
