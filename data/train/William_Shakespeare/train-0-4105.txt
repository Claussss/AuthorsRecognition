KING PHILIP It likes us well.—Young princes, close your hands. And your lips too, for I am well assured 535
That I did so when I was first assured. Louis the Dauphin and Lady Blanche join hands and kiss KING PHILIP Now citizens of Angers, ope your gates.
Let in that amity which you have made,
For at Saint Mary’s chapel presently
The rites of marriage shall be solemnized.—540
Is not the Lady Constance in this troop?
(Aside) I know she is not, for this match made up
Her presence would have interrupted much.
(Aloud) Where is she and her son ? Tell me who knows.
