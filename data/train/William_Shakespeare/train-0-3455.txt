BOLINGBROKE Bagot, forbear. Thou shalt not take it up. Excepting one, I would he were the best
In all this presence that hath moved me so. If that thy valour stand on sympathy,
There is my gage, Aumerle, in gage to thine. He throws down his gage By that fair sun which shows me where thou stand‘st,
I heard thee say, and vauntingly thou spak’st it,
That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester’s death.
If thou deny’st it twenty times, thou liest,
And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart,
Where it was forged, with my rapier’s point.
