I am too sore empierc
To soar with his light feathers, and so bound
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe;
Under love’s heavy burden do I sink. And to sink in it should you burden love—
Too great oppression for a tender thing. Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,
Too rude, too boist’rous, and it pricks like thorn.
