â€˜Then childish fear avaunt, debating die,
Respect and reason wait on wrinkled age!
My heart shall never countermand mine eye,
Sad pause and deep regard beseems the sage.
My part is youth, and beats these from the stage. Desire my pilot is, beauty my prize.
Then who fears sinking where such treasure lies?â€™
