KING RICHARD Stand all apart.â€”Cousin of Buckingham. BUCKINGHAM My gracious sovereign? KING RICHARD Give me thy hand. Thus high by thy advice
And thy assistance is King Richard seated.
But shall we wear these glories for a day?
Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them? Still live they, and for ever let them last.
