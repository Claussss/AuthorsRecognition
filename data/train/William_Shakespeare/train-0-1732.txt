Ha, ha, ha! Why dost thou laugh? It fits not with this hour. Why, I have not another tear to shed.
Besides, this sorrow is an enemy,
And would usurp upon my wat’ry eyes
And make them blind with tributary tears.
Then which way shall I find Revenge’s cave?—
For these two heads do seem to speak to me
And threat me I shall never come to bliss
Till all these mischiefs be returned again
Even in their throats that hath committed them.
Come, let me see what task I have to do.
