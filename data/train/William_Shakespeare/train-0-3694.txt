Where are the vile beginners of this fray? O noble Prince, I can discover all
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.
There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio. CAPULET’S WIFE Tybalt, my cousin, O, my brother’s child!
O Prince, O cousin, husband! O, the blood is spilled
Of my dear kinsman ! Prince, as thou art true,
For blood of ours shed blood of Montague!
O cousin, cousin!
