Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art: They draw but what they see, know not the heart.
25 Let those who are in favour with their stars
Of public honour and proud titles boast,
Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars,
Unlooked-for joy in that I honour most.
Great princes’ favourites their fair leaves spread
But as the marigold at the sun’s eye,
And in themselves their pride lies buried,
For at a frown they in their glory die.
The painful warrior famous
After a thousand victories once foiled
Is from the book of honour razed quite,
And all the rest forgot for which he toiled.
