Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow,
Whom he hath dulled and cloyed with gracious
favours—
That he should for a foreign purse so sell
His sovereign’s life to death and treachery.
Sound trumpets. Enter King Harry, Lord Scrope, the
Earl of Cambridge, and Sir Thomas Grey Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.
My lord of Cambridge, and my kind lord of Masham,
And you, my gentle knight, give me your thoughts.
Think you not that the powers we bear with us
Will cut their passage through the force of France,
Doing the execution and the act
For which we have in head assembled them?
