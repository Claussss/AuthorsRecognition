AENEAS (to Diomedes) Health to you, valiant sir, During all question of the gentle truce.
But when I meet you armed, as black defiance
As heart can think or courage execute. The one and other Diomed embraces.
Our bloods are now in calm; and so long, health.
But when contention and occasion meet,
By Jove Iâ€™ll play the hunter for thy life
With all my force, pursuit, and policy.
