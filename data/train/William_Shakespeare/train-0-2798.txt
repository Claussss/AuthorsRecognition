Sc. 17
Enter Edward Prince of Wales with his prisoners: jean King of France and the Dauphin, and all with ensigns spread. Retreat sounded 
PRINCE OF WALES (to the King and then the Dauphin) Now, Jean in France, and lately Jean of France,
Thy bloody ensigns are my captive coloursâ€”
And you, high-vaunting Charles of Normandy,
That once today sent me a horse to fly,
Are now the subjects of my clemency. 5
Fie, lords, is it not a shame that English boys,
Whose early days are yet not worth a beard,
Should in the bosom of your kingdom, thus,
One against twenty, beat you up together?
