SIR ANDREW Excellent good, i’faith. SIR TOBY Good, good. What is love? ’Tis not hereafter,
Present mirth hath present laughter.
What’s to come is still unsure.
In delay there lies no plenty,
Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty.
Youth’s a stuff will not endure. SIR ANDREW A mellifluous voice, as I am true knight.
