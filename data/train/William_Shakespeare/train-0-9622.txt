FIRST LORD DUMAINE ’Tis our hope, sir, After well-entered soldiers, to return
And find your grace in health. No, no, it cannot be—and yet my heart
Will not confess he owes the malady
That doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords.
Whether I live or die, be you the sons
Of worthy Frenchmen; let higher Italy—
Those bated that inherit but the fall
Of the last monarchy—see that you come
Not to woo honour but to wed it. When
The bravest questant shrinks, find what you seek,
That fame may cry you loud. I say farewell.
