Herald, conduct me to the Dauphin’s tent
To know who hath obtained the glory of the day. On what submissive message art thou sent? Submission, Dauphin?‘Tis a mere French word.
We English warriors wot not what it means.
I come to know what prisoners thou hast ta’en,
And to survey the bodies of the dead.
