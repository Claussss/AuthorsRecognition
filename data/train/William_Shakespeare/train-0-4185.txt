It is apparent foul play, and ’tis shame
That greatness should so grossly offer it.
So thrive it in your game; and so, farewell. Stay yet, Lord Salisbury; I’ll go with thee,
And find th’inheritance of this poor child,
His little kingdom of a forced grave.
That blood which owed the breadth of all this isle
Three foot of it doth hold. Bad world the while. 100
This must not be thus borne. This will break out
To all our sorrows; and ere long, I doubt.
