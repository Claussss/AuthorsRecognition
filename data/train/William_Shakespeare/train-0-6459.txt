REYNALDO Ay, very well, my lord. ‘And in part him, but’, you may say, ‘not well,
But if’t be he I mean, he’s very wild,
Addicted so and so’; and there put on him
What forgeries you please—marry, none so rank
As may dishonour him, take heed of that—
But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
As are companions noted and most known
To youth and liberty.
