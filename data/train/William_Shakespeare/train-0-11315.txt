We’ll higher to the mountains; there secure us.
To the King’s party there’s no going. Newness
Of Cloten’s death-we being not known, not mustered
Among the bands—may drive us to a render
Where we have lived, and so extort from ’s that
Which we have done, whose answer would be death
Drawn on with torture.
