She hales him up and down Thou shalt be whipped with wire and stewed in brine,
Smarting in ling’ring pickle. Gracious madam, I that do bring the news made not the match. Say ’tis not so, a province I will give thee,
And make thy fortunes proud. The blow thou hadst
Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage,
And I will boot thee with what gift beside
Thy modesty can beg.
