And I beseech you hear me, who professes
Myself your loyal servant, your physician,
Your most obedient counsellor; yet that dares
Less appear so in comforting your evils
Than such as most seem yoursâ€”I say, I come
From your good queen. LEONTES Good queen? Good queen, my lord, good queen, I say good queen,
And would by combat make her good, so were I
A man, the worst about you.
