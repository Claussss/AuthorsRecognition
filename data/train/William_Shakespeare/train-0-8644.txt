THIRD SERVANT If she live long And in the end meet the old course of death,
Women will all turn monsters. SECOND SERVANT Let’s follow the old Earl and get the bedlam
To lead him where he would. His roguish madness
Allows itself to anything. THIRD SERVANT Go thou. I’ll fetch some flax and whites of eggs
To apply to his bleeding face. Now heaven help him!
