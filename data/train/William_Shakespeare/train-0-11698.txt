SECOND GENTLEMAN But pray, how passed it? FIRST GENTLEMAN I’ll tell you in a little. The great Duke
Came to the bar, where to his accusations
He pleaded still not guilty, and alleg
Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.
The King’s attorney, on the contrary,
Urged on the examinations, proofs, confessions,
Of divers witnesses, which the Duke desired
To him brought viva voce to his face—
At which appeared against him his surveyor,
Sir Gilbert Perk his chancellor, and John Car,
Confessor to him, with that devil-monk,
Hopkins, that made this mischief.
