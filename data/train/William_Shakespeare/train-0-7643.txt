VOICES WITHIN Pardon, pardon, pardon, pardon! Room for the Earl of Surreyl Room there, room! Enter Surrey Save the man’s life, if it be possible! It is too late, my lord, he’s dead already. I tell ye, Master Sheriff, you are too forward
To make such haste with men unto their death.
I think your pains will merit little thanks,
Since that his highness is so merciful
As not to spill the blood of any subject.
