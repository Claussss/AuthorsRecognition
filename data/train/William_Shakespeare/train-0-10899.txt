CORNWALL What means your grace? Enter Goneril Who stocked my servant? Regan, I have good hope
Thou didst not know onâ€™t. Who comes here? O heavens,
If you do love old men, if your sweet sway
Allow obedience, if you yourselves are old,
Make it your cause! Send down and take my part.
(To Goneril) Art not ashamed to look upon this beard?
O Regan, will you take her by the hand?
