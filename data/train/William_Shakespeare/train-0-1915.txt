‘Tis done by me, and ends in ‘Margaret’. QUEEN ELIZABETH (to Margaret) Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself. QUEEN MARGARET Poor painted Queen, vain flourish of my fortune,
Why strew‘st thou sugar on that bottled spider
Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?
Fool, fool, thou whet’st a knife to kill thyself.
The day will come that thou shalt wish for me
To help thee curse this poisonous bunch-backed toad.
