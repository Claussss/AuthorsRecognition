We are shame-proof, my lord, and ‘tis some policy
To have one show worse than the King’s and his
company. KING I say they shall not come. Nay, my good lord, let me o’errule you now.
That sport best pleases that doth least know how.
Where zeal strives to content, and the contents
Dies in the zeal of that which it presents,
There form confounded makes most form in mirth,
When great things labouring perish in their birth.
