I wonder how the King escaped our hands? While we pursued the horsemen of the north,
He slyly stole away and left his men;
Whereat the great lord of Northumberland,
Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,
Cheered up the drooping army; and himself,
Lord Clifford, and Lord Stafford, all abreast,
Charged our main battleâ€™s front, and, breaking in,
Were by the swords of common soldiers slain.
