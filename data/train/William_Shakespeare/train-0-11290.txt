Stark, as you see, Thus smiling as some fly had tickled slumber,
Not as death’s dart being laughed at; his right cheek
Reposing on a cushion. O’th’ floor, His arms thus leagued. I thought he slept, and put
My clouted brogues from off my feet, whose rudeness
Answered my steps too loud. Why, he but sleeps.
