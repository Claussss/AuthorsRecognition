Let me have such a bowl may hold my thanks,
And save me so much talking. CARDINAL WOLSEY My lord Sands, I am beholden to you. Cheer your neighbours.
Ladies, you are not merry! Gentlemen,
Whose fault is this? The red wine first must rise In their fair cheeks, my lord, then we shall have â€™em
Talk us to silence.
