Let Ajax go to him.
(To Ajax) Dear lord, go you and greet him in his tent.
’Tis said he holds you well and will be led,
At your request, a little from himself. O Agamemnon, let it not be so.
We’ll consecrate the steps that Ajax makes
When they go from Achilles. Shall the proud lord
That bastes his arrogance with his own seam
And never suffers matter of the world
Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve
And ruminate himself—shall he be worshipped
Of that we hold an idol more than he?
No, this thrice-worthy and right valiant lord
Must not so stale his palm, nobly acquired,
Nor by my will assubjugate his merit,
As amply titled as Achilles’ is,
By going to Achilles—
That were to enlard his fat-already pride
And add more coals to Cancer when he burns
With entertaining great Hyperion.
This lord go to him? Jupiter forbid,
And say in thunder ‘Achilles, go to him’.
