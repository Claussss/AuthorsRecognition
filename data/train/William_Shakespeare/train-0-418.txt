FIRST HUNTSMAN I will, my lord. LORD (seeing Sly) What’s here? One dead, or drunk? See, doth he breathe? SECOND HUNTSMAN He breathes, my lord. Were he not warmed with ale
This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly. O monstrous beast! How like a swine he lies.
Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image.
Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.
What think you: if he were conveyed to bed,
Wrapped in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,
A most delicious banquet by his bed,
And brave attendants near him when he wakes—
Would not the beggar then forget himself?
