LYSANDER Helen, it is not so. Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,
Lest to thy peril thou aby it dear.
Enter Hermia
Look where thy love comes; yonder is thy dear. Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,
The ear more quick of apprehension makes.
Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,
It pays the hearing double recompense.
Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found;
Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound.
But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?
