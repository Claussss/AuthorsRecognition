What answer, sir? When spake I such a word? ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Even now, even here, not half an hour since. DROMIO OF SYRACUSE I did not see you since you sent me hence
Home to the Centaur with the gold you gave me. ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Villain, thou didst deny the gold’s receipt,
And told‘st me of a mistress and a dinner,
For which I hope thou felt’st I was displeased.
