Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke. Ill-spirited Worcester, did not we send grace,
Pardon, and terms of love to all of you ?
And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary,
Misuse the tenor of thy kinsman’s trust?
Three knights upon our party slain today,
A noble earl, and many a creature else,
Had been alive this hour
If like a Christian thou hadst truly borne
Betwixt our armies true intelligence.
