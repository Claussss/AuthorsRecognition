Exit Messenger CHARMIAN Good your highness, patience. In praising Antony I have dispraised Caesar. CHARMIAN Many times, madam. I am paid for’t now. Lead me from hence.
I faint. O Iras, Charmian—’tis no matter.
Go to the fellow, good Alexas, bid him
Report the feature of Octavia: her years,
Her inclination; let him not leave out
The colour of her hair. Bring me word quickly.
