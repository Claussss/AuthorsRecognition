Exeunt Costard and Jaquenetta Sweet lords, sweet tovers!â€”O, let us embrace.
As true we are as flesh and blood can be.
The sea will ebb and flow, heaven show his face.
Young blood doth not obey an old decree.
We cannot cross the cause why we were born,
Therefore of all hands must we be forsworn. What, did these rent lines show some love of thine?
