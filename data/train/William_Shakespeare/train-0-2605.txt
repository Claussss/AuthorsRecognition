DUC DE LORRAINE The most renowned prince, King Jean of France,
Doth greet thee, Edward, and by me commands
That, forsomuch as by his liberal gift
The Guienne dukedom is entailed to thee,
Thou do him lowly homage for the same.
And for that purpose, here I summon thee
Repair to France within these forty days
That there, according as the custom is,
Thou mayst be sworn true liegeman to our king;
Or else thy title in that province dies
And he himself will repossess the place.
