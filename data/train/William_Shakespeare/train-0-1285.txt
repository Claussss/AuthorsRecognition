KING EDWARD RICHARD OF GLOUCESTER Come, Warwick, take the time—kneel down, kneel
down.
Nay, when? Strike now, or else the iron cools. I had rather chop this hand off at a blow,
And with the other fling it at thy face,
Than bear so low a sail to strike to thee. KING EDWARD Sail how thou canst, have wind and tide thy friend,
This hand, fast wound about thy coal-black hair,
Shall, whiles thy head is warm and new cut off,
Write in the dust this sentence with thy blood:
‘Wind-changing Warwick now can change no more’.
