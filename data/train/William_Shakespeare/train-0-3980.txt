Enter Quince, Flute, Snout, and Starveling 
QUINCE Have you sent to Bottomâ€™s house? Is he come home yet? STARVELING He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt he is transported. FLUTE If he come not, then the play is marred. It goes not forward. Doth it? QUINCE It is not possible. You have not a man in all Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he.
