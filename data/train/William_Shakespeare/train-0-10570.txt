ANTIGONUS Anything, my lord, That my ability may undergo,
And nobleness impose. At least thus much,
I’ll pawn the little blood which I have left
To save the innocent; anything possible. It shall be possible. Swear by this sword
Thou wilt perform my bidding. I will, my lord. Mark, and perform it. Seest thou? For the fail
Of any point in’t shall not only be
Death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife,
Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,
As thou art liegeman to us, that thou carry
This female bastard hence, and that thou bear it
To some remote and desert place, quite out
Of our dominions; and that there thou leave it,
Without more mercy, to it own protection
And favour of the climate. As by strange fortune
It came to us, I do in justice charge thee,
On thy soul’s peril and thy body’s torture,
That thou commend it strangely to some place
Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.
