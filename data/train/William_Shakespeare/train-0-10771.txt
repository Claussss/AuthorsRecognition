CORDELIA (aside) What shall Cordelia speak? Love and be silent. LEAR (to Goneril) Of all these bounds even from this line to this,
With shadowy forests and with champaigns riched,
With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,
We make thee lady. To thine and Albany’s issues
Be this perpetual.—What says our second daughter?
Our dearest Regan, wife of Cornwall?
