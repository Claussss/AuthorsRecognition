Enter Troilus PANDARUS Here, here, here he comes. Ah, sweet ducks! CRESSIDA (embracing him) O Troilus, Troilus! PANDARUS What a pair of spectacles is here! Let me embrace you too. ‘O heart‘, as the goodly saying is,
‘O heart, heavy heart,
Why sigh’st thou without breaking?’
where he answers again
‘Because thou canst not ease thy smart
By friendship nor by speaking.’
There was never a truer rhyme. Let us cast away
nothing, for we may live to have need of such a verse.
We see it, we see it. How now, lambs?
