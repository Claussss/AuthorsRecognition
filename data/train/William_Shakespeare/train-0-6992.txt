One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons,
A natural perspective, that is and is not. Antonio! O, my dear Antonio,
How have the hours racked and tortured me
Since I have lost thee! ANTONIO Sebastian are you? SEBASTIAN Fearâ€™st thou that, Antonio? How have you made division of yourself?
An apple cleft in two is not more twin
Than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?
