My lord, I had forgot to tell your lordship,
Today as I came by I called there—
But I shall grieve you to report the rest. YORK What is’t, knave? An hour before I came, the Duchess died. God for his mercy, what a tide of woes
Comes rushing on this woeful land at once!
I know not what to do. I would to God,
So my untruth had not provoked him to it,
The King had cut off my head with my brother’s.
What, are there no posts dispatched for Ireland?
How shall we do for money for these wars?
(To the Queen) Come, sister—cousin, I would say; pray
pardon me.
(To the Servingman) Go, fellow, get thee home. Provide
some carts,
And bring away the armour that is there.
