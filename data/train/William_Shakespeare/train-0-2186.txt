Fortune and victory sit on thy helm! HENRY EARL OF RICHMOND All comfort that the dark night can afford
Be to thy person, noble father-in-law.
Tell me, how fares our loving mother? I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,
Who prays continually for Richmond’s good.
So much for that. The silent hours steal on,
And flaky darkness breaks within the east.
In brief—for so the season bids us be—
Prepare thy battle early in the morning,
And put thy fortune to th’arbitrement
Of bloody strokes and mortal-sharing war.
I, as I may—that which I would, I cannot—
With best advantage will deceive the time,
And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms.
But on thy side I may not be too forward—
Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George,
Be executed in his father’s sight.
Farewell. The leisure and the fearful time
Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love
And ample interchange of sweet discourse,
Which so long sundered friends should dwell upon.
God give us leisure for these rights of love.
Once more, adieu. Be valiant, and speed well.
