I yield all this; But for some other reasons, my grave sir,
Which ’tis not fit you know, I not acquaint
My father of this business. Let him know’t. He shall not. Prithee let him. No, he must not. OLD SHEPHERD Let him, my son. He shall not need to grieve
At knowing of thy choice. Come, come, he must not.
