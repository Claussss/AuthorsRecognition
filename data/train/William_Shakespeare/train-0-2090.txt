Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing news! DORSET (to Anne) Be of good cheer.—Mother, how fares your grace? QUEEN ELIZABETH O Dorset, speak not to me. Get thee gone.
Death and destruction dogs thee at thy heels.
Thy mother’s name is ominous to children.
If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,
And live with Richmond from the reach of hell.
Go, hie thee! Hie thee from this slaughterhouse,
Lest thou increase the number of the dead,
And make me die the thrall of Margaret’s curses:
‘Nor mother, wife, nor counted England’s Queen’.
