You hear the horns—Enter your muset lest this match between’s
Be crossed ere met. Give me your hand, farewell.
I’ll bring you every needful thing—I pray you,
Take comfort and be strong. Pray hold your promise, And do the deed with a bent brow. Most certain
You love me not—be rough with me and pour
This oil out of your language. By this air,
I could for each word give a cuff, my stomach
Not reconciled by reason.
