No, no; he’s gone. SEBASTIAN (to Alonso) Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,
That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,
But rather loose her to an African,
Where she, at least, is banished from your eye,
Who hath cause to wet the grief on’t. Prithee, peace. You were kneeled to and importuned otherwise
By all of us, and the fair soul herself
Weighed between loathness and obedience at
Which end o’th’ beam should bow. We have lost your
son,
I fear, for ever. Milan and Naples have
More widows in them of this business’ making
Than we bring men to comfort them. The fault’s your
own.
