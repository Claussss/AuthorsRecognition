After my death the one half of my lands,
And in possession twenty thousand crowns. And for that dowry I’ll assure her of
Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,
In all my lands and leases whatsoever.
Let specialties be therefore drawn between us,
That covenants may be kept on either hand. Ay, when the special thing is well obtained—
That is her love, for that is all in all.
