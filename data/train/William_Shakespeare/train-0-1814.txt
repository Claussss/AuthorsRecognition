This will I do, and soon return again. Exit Now will I hence about thy business,
And take my ministers along with me. Nay, nay, let Rape and Murder stay with me,
Or else Iâ€™ll call my brother back again,
And cleave to no revenge but Lucius. TAMORA (aside to her sons) What say you, boys, will you abide with him
Whiles I go tell my lord the Emperor
How I have governed our determined jest?
Yield to his humour, smooth and speak him fair,
And tarry with him till I turn again.
