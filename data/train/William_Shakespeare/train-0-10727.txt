Would he do so, I’d beg your precious mistress,
Which he counts but a trifle. Sir, my liege, Your eye hath too much youth in’t. Not a month
Fore your queen died she was more worth such gazes
Than what you look on now. I thought of her Even in these looks I made. (To Florizel) But your petition
Is yet unanswered. I will to your father.
Your honour not o’erthrown by your desires,
I am friend to them and you. Upon which errand
I now go toward him. Therefore follow me,
And mark what way I make. Come, good my lord.
