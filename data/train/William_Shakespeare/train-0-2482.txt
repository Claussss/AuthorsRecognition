To ruinate proud buildings with thy hours
And smear with dust their glitt’ring golden towers; ‘To fill with worm-holes stately monuments,
To feed oblivion with decay of things,
To blot old books and alter their contents,
To pluck the quills from ancient ravens’ wings,
To dry the old oak’s sap and blemish springs,
