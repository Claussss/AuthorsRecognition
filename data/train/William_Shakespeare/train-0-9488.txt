For both, my lord. I would they’d fight i‘th’ fire or i’th’ air;
We’d fight there too. But this it is: our foot
Upon the hills adjoining to the city
Shall stay with us. Order for sea is given.
They have put forth the haven—
Where their appointment we may best discover,
And look on their endeavour. 4.12
Enter Caesar and his army
