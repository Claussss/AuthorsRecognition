New customs, Though they be never so ridiculous—
Nay, let ’em be unmanly—yet are followed. LORD CHAMBERLAIN As far as I see, all the good our English
Have got by the late voyage is but merely
A fit or two o’th’ face. But they are shrewd ones,
For when they hold ’em you would swear directly
Their very noses had been counsellors
To Pepin or Clotharius, they keep state so.
