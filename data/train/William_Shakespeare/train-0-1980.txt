BOY (to Elizabeth) Ah, aunt, you wept not for our father’s death.
How can we aid you with our kindred tears? DAUGHTER (to Elizabeth) Our fatherless distress was left unmoaned;
Your widow-dolour likewise be unwept. QUEEN ELIZABETH Give me no help in lamentation.
I am not barren to bring forth complaints.
All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes,
That I, being governed by the wat’ry moon,
May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world.
Ah, for my husband, for my dear Lord Edward!
