How now, what letter are you reading there? May’t please your lordship, ‘tis a word or two
Of commendations sent from Valentine,
Delivered by a friend that came from him. Lend me the letter. Let me see what news. There is no news, my lord, but that he writes
How happily he lives, how well beloved
And daily grac
Wishing me with him, partner of his fortune.
