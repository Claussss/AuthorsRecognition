LEAR My curses on her. REGAN O sir, you are old. Nature in you stands on the very verge
Of his confine. You should be ruled and led
By some discretion that discerns your state
Better than you yourself. Therefore I pray you
That to our sister you do make return;
Say you have wronged her. Ask her forgiveness?
