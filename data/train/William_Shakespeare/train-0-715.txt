Methought this staff, mine office-badge in court,
Was broke in twain—by whom I have forgot,
But, as I think, it was by th’ Cardinal—
And on the pieces of the broken wand
Were placed the heads of Edmund, Duke of Somerset,
And William de la Pole, first Duke of Suffolk.
This was my dream—what it doth bode, God knows.
