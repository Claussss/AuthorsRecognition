That was the way to make his godhead wax,
For he hath been five thousand year a boy. Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows, too. You’ll ne’er be friends with him, a killed your sister. He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy,
And so she died. Had she been light like you,
Of such a merry, nimble, stirring spirit,
She might ha’ been a grandam ere she died;
And so may you, for a light heart lives long.
