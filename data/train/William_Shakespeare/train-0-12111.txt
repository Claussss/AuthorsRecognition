Must these men die too? When he speaks, his tongue
 Sounds like a trumpet. All his lineaments
Are as a man would wish ’em—strong and clean.
He wears a well-steeled axe, the staff of gold.
His age, some five-and-twenty. There’s another—
 A little man, but of a tough soul, seeming
As great as any. Fairer promises
In such a body yet I never looked on.
