GEORGE OF CLARENCE A little gale will soon disperse that cloud,
And blow it to the source from whence it came.
Thy very beams will dry those vapours up,
For every cloud engenders not a storm. RICHARD OF GLOUCESTER The Queen is valued thirty thousand strong,
And Somerset, with Oxford, fled to her.
If she have time to breathe, be well assured,
Her faction will be full as strong as ours.
