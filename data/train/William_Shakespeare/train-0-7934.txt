I talk not of your soul. Our compelled sins
Stand more for number than for account. How say you? Nay, I’ll not warrant that, for I can speak
Against the thing I say. Answer to this.
I now, the voice of the recorded law,
Pronounce a sentence on your brother’s life.
Might there not be a charity in sin
To save this brother’s life?
