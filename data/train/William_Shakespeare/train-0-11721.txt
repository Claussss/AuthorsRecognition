This priest has no pride in him! Not to speak of. I would not be so sick, though, for his place—
But this cannot continue. I’ll venture one have-at-him. Exeunt Norfolk and Suffolk CARDINAL WOLSEY (to the King) Your grace has given a precedent of wisdom
Above all princes in committing freely
Your scruple to the voice of Christendom.
Who can be angry now? What envy reach you?
The Spaniard, tied by blood and favour to her,
Must now confess, if they have any goodness,
The trial just and noble. All the cterks—
I mean the learn
Have their free voices. Rome, the nurse of judgement,
Invited by your noble self, hath sent
One general tongue unto us: this good man,
This just and learned priest, Card’nal Campeius,
Whom once more I present unto your highness.
