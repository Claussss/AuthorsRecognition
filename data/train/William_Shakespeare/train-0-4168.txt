HUBERTI have sworn to do it, And with hot irons must I burn them out. Ah, none but in this iron age would do it. 60
The iron of itself, though heat red hot,
Approaching near these eyes would drink my tears,
And quench his fiery indignation
Even in the matter of mine innocence;
Nay, after that, consume away in rust,
But for containing fire to harm mine eye.
Are you more stubborn-hard than hammered iron?
An if an angel should have come to me
And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes,
I would not have believed him; no tongue but
Hubertâ€™s.
