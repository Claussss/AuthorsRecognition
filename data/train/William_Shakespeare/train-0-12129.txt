Here they fall on their faces, as formerly, and there is heard clanging of armour, with a short thunder, as the burst of a battle, whereupon they all rise and bow to the altar O great corrector of enormous times,
 Shaker of o’er-rank states, thou grand decider
Of dusty and old titles, that heal’st with blood
The earth when it is sick, and cur’st the world
O’th’ plurisy of people, I do take
Thy signs auspiciously, and in thy name,
To my design, march boldly. (To his Knights) Let us go.
