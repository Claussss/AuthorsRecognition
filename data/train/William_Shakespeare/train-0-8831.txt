SENATOR giving him bonds Take the bonds along with you, And have the dates in count. CAPHIS I will, sir. SENATOR Go. Exeunt severally 2.2
Enter Flavius, with many bills in his hand No care, no stop; so senseless of expense
That he will neither know how to maintain it
Nor cease his flow of riot, takes no account
How things go from him, nor resumes no care
Of what is to continue. Never mind
Was to be so unwise to be so kind.
What shall be done? He will not hear till feel.
