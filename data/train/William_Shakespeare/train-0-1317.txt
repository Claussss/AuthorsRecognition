GEORGE OF CLARENCE Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it? QUEEN MARGARET Ay, but thou usest to forswear thyself.
‘Twas sin before, but now ’tis charity.
What, wilt thou not? Where is that devil’s butcher,
Hard-favoured Richard? Richard, where art thou?
Thou art not here. Murder is thy atms-deed—
Petitioners for blood thou ne‘er putt’st back.
