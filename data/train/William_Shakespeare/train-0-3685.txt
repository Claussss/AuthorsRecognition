Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
That thou hast done me. Therefore turn and draw. I do protest I never injured thee,
But love thee better than thou canst devise
Till thou shalt know the reason of my love.
And so, good Capulet—which name I tender
As dearly as mine own—be satisfied. MERCUTIO drawing
