On him, on him. Look you how pale he glares.
His form and cause conjoined, preaching to stones,
Would make them capable. (To the Ghost) Do not look
upon me,
Lest with this piteous action you convert
My stern effects. Then what I have to do
Will want true colourâ€”tears perchance for blood. QUEEN GERTRUDE
