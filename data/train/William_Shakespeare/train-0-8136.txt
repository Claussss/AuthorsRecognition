Let him do his spite. My services which I have done the signory
Shall out-tongue his complaints. ’Tis yet to know—
Which, when I know that boasting is an honour,
I shall promu]gate—I fetch my life and being
From men of royal siege, and my demerits
May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune
As this that I have reached. For know, Iago,
But that I love the gentle Desdemona
I would not my unhous
Put into circumscription and confine
For the seas’ worth.
