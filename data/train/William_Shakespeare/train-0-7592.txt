Peace there, I say! Hear Captain Lincoln speak.
Keep silence till we know his mind at large. CLOWN BETTS [to Lincoln] Then largely deliver. Speak, bully, and he that presumes to interrupt thee in thy oration, this for him! Then gallant bloods, you whose free souls do scorn
To bear the enforced wrongs of aliens,
Add rage to resolution. Fire the houses
Of these audacious strangers. This is St Martin’s,
And yonder dwells Meautis, a wealthy Picardy,
At the Green Gate;
De Barde, Peter van Hollak, Adrian Martin,
With many more outlandish fugitives.
Shall these enjoy more privilege than we
In our own country? Let’s then become their slaves.
Since justice keeps not them in greater awe,
We’ll be ourselves rough ministers at law.
