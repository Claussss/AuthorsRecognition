Music ceases O spirit of love, how quick and fresh art thou
That, notwithstanding thy capacity
Receiveth as the sea, naught enters there,
Of what validity and pitch so eâ€™er,
But falls into abatement and low price
Even in a minute! So full of shapes is fancy
That it alone is high fantastical. Will you go hunt, my lord?
