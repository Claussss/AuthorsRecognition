Now must I tell ye, madam, we have a play
To welcome ye withal. How good soe’er
That know not I; my lord will have it so. Wife, hope the best; I am sure they’ll do their best.
They that would better comes not at their feast.
My good Lord Cardinal’s players, I thank them for it,
Play us a play, to lengthen out your welcome,
My good Lord Mayor and all my other friends.
They say it is The Marriage of Wit and Wisdom—
A theme of some import, howe’er it prove.
But if art fail, we’ll inch it out with love.
What, are they ready?
