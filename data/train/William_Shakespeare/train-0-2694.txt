Enter a French Mariner Near to the coast I have descried, my lord,
As I was busy in my watchful charge,
The proud armada of King Edward’s ships,
Which, at the first far off when I did ken,
Seemed as it were a grove of withered pines,
But drawing near, their glorious bright aspect,
Their streaming ensigns wrought of coloured silk,
Like to a meadow full of sundry flowers,
Adorns the naked bosom of the earth.
Majestical the order of their course,
Figuring the horn
And on the top gallant of the admiral,
And likewise all the handmaids of his train,
The arms of England and of France unite
Are quartered equally by herald’s art.
Thus titely carried with a merry gale
They plough the ocean hitherward amain.
