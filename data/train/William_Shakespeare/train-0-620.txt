I dare assure you, sir, ’tis almost two,
And ’twill be supper-time ere you come there. It shall be seven ere I go to horse.
Look what I speak, or do, or think to do,
You are still crossing it. Sirs, let’t alone.
I will not go today, and ere I do
It shall be what o’clock I say it is. HORTENSIO (aside)
