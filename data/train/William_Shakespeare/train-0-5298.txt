I shall observe him with all care and love. Why art thou not at Windsor with him, Thomas? 50 He is not there today; he dines in London. And how accompanied? Canst thou tell that? With Poins and other his continual followers. Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds,
And he, the noble image of my youth,
Is overspread with them; therefore my grief
Stretches itself beyond the hour of death.
The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape
In forms imaginary thâ€™unguided days
And rotten times that you shall look upon 60
When I am sleeping with my ancestors;
For when his headstrong riot hath no curb,
When rage and hot blood are his counsellors,
When means and lavish manners meet together,
O, with what wings shall his affections fly
Towards fronting peril and opposed decay?
