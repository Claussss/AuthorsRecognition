(Sings) For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy. Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself
She turns to favour and to prettiness. OPHELIA (sings) And will a not come again,
And will a not come again?
No, no, he is dead,
Go to thy death-bed,
He never will come again.
His beard as white as snow,
All flaxen was his poll.
He is gone, he is gone,
And we cast away moan.
God ‘a’ mercy on his soul.
