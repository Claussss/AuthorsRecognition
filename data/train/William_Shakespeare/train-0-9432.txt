Is Antony or we in fault for this? Antony only, that would make his will
Lord of his reason. What though you fled
From that great face of war, whose several ranges
Frighted each other? Why should he follow?
The itch of his affection should not then
Have nicked his captainship, at such a point,
When half to half the world opposed, he being
The mooted question. â€™Twas a shame no less
Than was his loss, to course your flying flags
And leave his navy gazing.
