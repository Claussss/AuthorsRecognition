Another noise. Enter the Earl of Salisbury brought in by a French Captain FRENCH CAPTAIN Behold, my liege, this knight and forty more,
Of whom the better part are slain and fled,
With all endeavour sought to break our ranks
And make their way to the encompassed Prince.
Dispose of him as please your majesty.
