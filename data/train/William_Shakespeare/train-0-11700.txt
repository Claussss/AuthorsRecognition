SECOND GENTLEMAN After all this, how did he bear himself? FIRST GENTLEMAN When he was brought again to thâ€™ bar to hear
His knell rung out, his judgement, he was stirred
With such an agony he sweat extremely,
And something spoke in choler, ill and hasty;
But he fell to himself again, and sweetly
In all the rest showed a most noble patience.
