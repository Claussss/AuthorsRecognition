Certainly, sir, I can. By what? By any other house or person?
Of anything the image tell me that
Hath kept with thy remembrance. ’Tis far off, And rather like a dream than an assurance
That my remembrance warrants. Had I not
Four or five women once that tended me? Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it
That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else
In the dark backward and abyss of time?
If thou rememb‘rest aught ere thou cam’st here,
How thou cam’st here thou mayst.
