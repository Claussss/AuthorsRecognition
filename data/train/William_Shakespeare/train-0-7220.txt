O you shall be exposed, my lord, to dangers
As infinite as imminent. But I’ll be true. And I’ll grow friend with danger. Wear this sleeve. And you this glove. When shall I see you? I will corrupt the Grecian sentinels
To give thee nightly visitation.
But yet, be true. CRESSIDA O heavens! ’Be true’ again!
