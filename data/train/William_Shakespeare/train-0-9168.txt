Bleed, bleed, poor country! Great tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure,
For goodness dare not check thee. Wear thou thy
wrongs; The title is affeered. Fare thee well, lord.
I would not be the villain that thou think’st
For the whole space that’s in the tyrant’s grasp,
And the rich east to boot. Be not offended.
