Flourish within. Enter a Herald Rejoice, my lord! Ascend the imperial throne!
The mighty and redoubted Prince of Wales,
Great servitor to bloody Mars in arms,
The Frenchman’s terror and his country’s fame,
Triumphant rideth like a Roman peer,
And, lowly, at his stirrup, comes afoot
King Jean of France together with his son
In captive bonds, whose diadem he brings
To crown thee with, and to proclaim thee king.
