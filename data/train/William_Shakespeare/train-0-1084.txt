She puts a paper crown on York’s head Ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king,
Ay, this is he that took King Henry’s chair,
And this is he was his adopted heir.
But how is it that great Plantagenet
Is crowned so soon and broke his solemn oath?
As I bethink me, you should not be king
Till our King Henry had shook hands with death.
And will you pale your head in Henry’s glory,
And rob his temples of the diadem
Now, in his life, against your holy oath?
O ’tis a fault too, too, unpardonable.
Off with the crown,
