Why then, my liege, let me enjoy her jewels. KING OF SCOTLAND Those are her own, still liable to her;
And who inherits her hath those with all. Enter a Scottish messenger in haste My liege, as we were pricking on the hills
To fetch in booty, marching hitherward
We might descry a mighty host of men.
The sun, reflecting on the armour, showed
A field of plate; a wood of picks advanced.
Bethink your highness speedily herein:
An easy march within four hours will bring
The hindmost rank unto this place, my liege.
