GLOUCESTER to ambassadors And for the proffer of my lord your master,
I have informed his highness so at large
As, liking of the lady’s virtuous gifts,
Her beauty, and the value of her dower,
He doth intend she shall be England’s queen. KING HENRY to ambassadors In argument and proof of which contract
Bear her this jewel, pledge of my affection.
(To Gloucester) And so, my lord Protector, see them
guarded
And safely brought to Dover, wherein shipped,
Commit them to the fortune of the sea.
