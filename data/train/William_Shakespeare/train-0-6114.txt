Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.
O hateful Error, Melancholy’s child,
Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men
The things that are not? O Error, soon conceived,
Thou never com‘st unto a happy birth,
But kill’st the mother that engendered thee. What, Pindarus! Where art thou, Pindarus?
