O, that’s an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio,
But I will have my lord and you again
As friendly as you were. CASSIO Bounteous madam, Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio
He’s never anything but your true servant. I know’t. I thank you. You do love my lord.
You have known him long, and be you well assured
He shall in strangeness stand no farther off
Than in a politic distance.
