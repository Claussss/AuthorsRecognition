These words like daggers enter in mine ears.
No more, sweet Hamlet. HAMLET A murderer and a villain, A slave that is not twenti’th part the tithe
Of your precedent lord, a vice of kings,
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
And put it in his pocket— QUEEN GERTRUDE No more.
