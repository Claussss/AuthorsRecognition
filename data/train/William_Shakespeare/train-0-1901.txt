RIVERS What ‘marry, may she’? RICHARD GLOUCESTER What marry, may she? Marry with a king:
A bachelor, and a handsome stripling, too.
Iwis your grandam had a worser match. QUEEN ELIZABETH My lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne
Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs.
By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty
Of those gross taunts that oft I have endured.
I had rather be a country servant-maid
Than a great queen, with this condition:
To be so baited, scorned, and stormed at.
