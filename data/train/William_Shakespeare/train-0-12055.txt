All these persons apparelled to the life, the men
issuing out of one door and the wenches from the
other. They dance a morris Ladies, if we have been merry,
And have pleased ye with a derry,
And a derry, and a down,
Say the schoolmaster’s no clown.
Duke, if we have pleased thee too,
And have done as good boys should do,
Give us but a tree or twain
For a maypole, and again,
Ere another year run out,
We’ll make thee laugh, and all this rout.
THESEUS
