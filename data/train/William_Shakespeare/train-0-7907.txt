Enter Lucio and Isabella PROVOST God save your honour. Stay a little while. (To Isabella) You’re welcome.
What’s your will? I am a woeful suitor to your honour.
Please but your honour hear me. ANGELO Well, what’s your suit? There is a vice that most I do abhor,
And most desire should meet the blow of justice,
For which I would not plead, but that I must;
For which I must not plead, but that I am
At war ’twixt will and will not.
