ANGELO Maiden, no remedy. Yes, I do think that you might pardon him,
And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy. I will not do’t. But can you if you would? Look what I will not, that I cannot do. But might you do’t, and do the world no wrong,
If so your heart were touched with that remorse
As mine is to him?
