QUEEN ELEANOR I like thee well. Wilt thou forsake thy fortune,
Bequeath thy land to him, and follow me?
I am a soldier and now bound to France. 150 Brother, take you my land; I’ll take my chance.
Your face hath got five hundred pound a year,
Yet sell your face for fivepence and ’tis dear.—
Madam, I’ll follow you unto the death.
