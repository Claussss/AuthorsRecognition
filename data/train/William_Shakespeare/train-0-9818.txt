What’s your will? HELEN That it will please you To give this poor petition to the King,
And aid me with that store of power you have
To come into his presence. GENTLEMAN The King’s not here. HELEN Not here, sir? Not indeed. He hence removed last night, and with more haste
Than is his use. WIDOW Lord, how we lose our pains.
