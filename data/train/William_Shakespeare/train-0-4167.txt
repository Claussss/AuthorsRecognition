Too fairly, Hubert, for so foul effect.
Must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes? Young boy, I must. ARTHUR And will you? HUBERTAnd I will. 40 Have you the heart? When your head did but ache
I knit my handkerchief about your brows,
The best I had—a princess wrought it me,
And I did never ask it you again—
And with my hand at midnight held your head,
And like the watchful minutes to the hour
Still and anon cheered up the heavy time,
Saying ‘What lack you?’ and ‘Where lies your grief?’
Or ‘What good love may I perform for you?’
Many a poor man’s son would have lain still
And ne’er have spoke a loving word to you,
But you at your sick service had a prince.
Nay, you may think my love was crafty love,
And call it cunning. Do, an if you will.
If heaven be pleased that you must use me ill, 55
Why then you must. Will you put out mine eyes,
These eyes that never did, nor never shall,
So much as frown on you?
