I am sorrow for thee. By thine own tongue thou art condemned, and must
Endure our law. Thouâ€™rt dead. That headless man I thought had been my lord. CYMBELINE (to soldiers) Bind the offender, And take him from our presence. Stay, sir King. This boy is better than the man he slew,
As well descended as thyself, and hath
More of thee merited than a band of Clotens
Had ever scar for. Let his arms alone;
They were not born for bondage.
