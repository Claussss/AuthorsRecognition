All’s well. I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters.
To you they have showed some truth. I think not of them; Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,
We would spend it in some words upon that business
If you would grant the time. At your kind’st leisure. If you shall cleave to my consent when ’tis,
It shall make honour for you.
