KING OF FRANCE By this it seems we shall be fortunate.
For, as it is impossible that stones
Should ever rise and break the battle â€™ray,
Or airy fowl make men in arms to quake,
So is it like we shall not be subdued.
Or, say this might be true: yet in the end,
Since he doth promise we shall drive him hence
And scourge their country as they have done ours,
By this revenge that loss will seem the less.
But all are frivolous fancies, toys and dreams.
Once we are sure we have ensnared the son,
Catch we the father after how we can.
