FRENCHMAN (to Posthumus) Sir, we have known together in Orl POSTHUMUS Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies which I will be ever to pay, and yet pay still. FRENCHMAN Sir, you oâ€™er-rate my poor kindness. I was glad I did atone my countryman and you. It had been pity you should have been put together with so mortal a purpose as then each bore, upon importance of so slight and trivial a nature.
