Enter George Duke of Clarence with a drummer and soldiers bearingcolours And lo, where George of Clarence sweeps along,
Of force enough to bid his brother battle;
With whom an upright zeal to right prevails
More than the nature of a brotherâ€™s love. GEORGE OF CLARENCE Clarence, Clarence, for Lancaster!
