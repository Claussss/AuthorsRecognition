 Is thy name Tyrrell? James Tyrrell, and your most obedient subject. KING RICHARD Art thou indeed? Prove me, my gracious lord. KING RICHARD Dar’st thou resolve to kill a friend of mine? Please you, but I had rather kill two enemies. KING RICHARD Why there thou hast it: two deep enemies,
Foes to my rest, and my sweet sleep’s disturbers,
Are they that I would have thee deal upon.
Tyrrell, I mean those bastards in the Tower.
