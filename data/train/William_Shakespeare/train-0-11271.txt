Nobly he yokes A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh
Was that it was for not being such a smile;
The smile mocking the sigh that it would fly
From so divine a temple to commix
With winds that sailors rail at. That grief and patience, rooted in him both,
Mingle their spurs together. Grow patience, And let the stinking elder, grief, untwine
His perishing root with the increasing vine.
