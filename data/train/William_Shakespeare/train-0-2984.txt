I knew he was not in his perfect wits. SECOND MERCHANT I am sorry now that I did draw on him. How long hath this possession held the man? This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,
And much, much different from the man he was;
But till this afternoon his passion
Ne’er brake into extremity of rage. Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck at sea?
Buried some dear friend?Hath not else his eye
Strayed his affection in unlawful love—
A sin prevailing much in youthful men,
Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing?
Which of these sorrows is he subject to?
