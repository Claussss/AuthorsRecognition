GUILDENSTERN Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and start not so wildly from my affair. HAMLET I am tame, sir. Pronounce. GUILDENSTERN The Queen your mother, in most great affliction of spirit, hath sent me to you. HAMLET You are welcome. GUILDENSTERN Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed. If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do your motherâ€™s commandment; if not, your pardon and my return shall be the end of my business.
