LODOVICO Who, I, my lord? Ay, you did wish that I would make her turn.
Sir; she can turn and turn, and yet go on
And turn again, and she can weep, sir, weep,
And she’s obedient, as you say, obedient,
Very obedient. (To Desdemona) Proceed you in your
tears.
(To Lodovico) Concerning this, sir—(To Desdemona) O
well painted passion!
(To Lodovico) I am commanded home. (To Desdemona)
Get you away.
I’ll send for you anon. (To Lodovico) Sir, I obey the
mandate,
And will return to Venice. (To Desdemona) Hence,
avaunt!
