DAUPHIN By faith and honour, Our madams mock at us and plainly say
Our mettle is bred out, and they will give
Their bodies to the lust of English youth,
To new-store France with bastard warriors. They bid us, ‘To the English dancing-schools,
And teach lavoltas high and swift corantos’—
Saying our grace is only in our heels,
And that we are most lofty runaways.
