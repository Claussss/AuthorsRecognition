As much to him, else is his thanks too much. Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
Be heaped like mine, and that thy skill be more
To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
This neighbour air, and let rich musicâ€™s tongue
Unfold the imagined happiness that both
Receive in either by this dear encounter.
