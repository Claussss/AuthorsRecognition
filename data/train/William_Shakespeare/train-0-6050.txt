Octavius, I have seen more days than you,
And though we lay these honours on this man
To ease ourselves of divers slandâ€™rous loads,
He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,
To groan and sweat under the business,
Either led or driven as we point the way;
And having brought our treasure where we will,
Then take we down his load, and turn him off,
Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears
And graze in commons.
