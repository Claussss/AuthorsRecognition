’Tis wonderful. Come, go we in procession to the village,
And be it death proclaimed through our host
To boast of this, or take that praise from God
Which is his only. FLUELLEN Is it not lawful, an’t please your majesty, to tell how many is killed? Yes, captain, but with this acknowledgement,
That God fought for us.
