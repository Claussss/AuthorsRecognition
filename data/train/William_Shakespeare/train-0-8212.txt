Enter Montano, Cassio, Gentlemen, [and servants] with wine But here they come.
If consequence do but approve my dream,
My boat sails freely both with wind and stream. Fore God, they have given me a rouse already. Good faith, a little one; not past a pint,
As I am a soldier. IAGO Some wine, ho! And let me the cannikin clink, clink, And let me the cannikin clink.
A soldier’s a man,
O, man’s life’s but a span,
Why then, let a soldier drink.
