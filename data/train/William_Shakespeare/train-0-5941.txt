CASSIUS Am I not stayed for? Tell me. CINNA Yes, you are. O Cassius, if you could
But win the noble Brutus to our party— Be you content. Good Cinna, take this paper,
He gives Cinna letters
And look you lay it in the Praetor’s Chair,
Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this
In at his window. Set this up with wax
Upon old Brutus’ statue. All this done,
Repair to Pompey’s Porch where you shall find us.
Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?
