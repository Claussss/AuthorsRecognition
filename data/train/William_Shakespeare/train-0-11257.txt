Prithee, fair youth, Think us no churls, nor measure our good minds
By this rude place we live in. Well encountered.
’Tis almost night. You shall have better cheer
Ere you depart, and thanks to stay and eat it.
Boys, bid him welcome. Were you a woman, youth, I should woo hard but be your groom in honesty,
Ay, bid for you as I’d buy.
