Ariel, thy charge Exactly is performed; but there’s more work.
What is the time o’th’ day? Past the mid season. At least two glasses. The time ’twixt six and now
Must by us both be spent most preciously. Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,
Let me remember thee what thou hast promised
Which is not yet performed me.
