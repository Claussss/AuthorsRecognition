d. AFTER 2.2.88 The Folio has Dorset and Rivers enter with Queen Elizabeth at 2.2.33.I. Comfort, dear mother. God is much displeased
That you take with unthankfulness his doing.
In common worldly things â€™tis called ungrateful
With dull unwillingness to pay a debt
Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent;
Much more to be thus opposite with heaven
For it requires the royal debt it lent you.
