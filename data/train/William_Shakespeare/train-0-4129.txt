KING PHILIP I may disjoin my hand, but not my faith. So mak‘st thou faith an enemy to faith,
And like a civil war, sett’st oath to oath, 190
Thy tongue against thy tongue. O, let thy vow,
First made to heaven, first be to heaven performed;
That is, to be the champion of our Church.
What since thou swor‘st is sworn against thyself,
And may not be perform
For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss
Is not amiss when it is truly done;
And being not done where doing tends to ill,
The truth is then most done not doing it.
The better act of purposes mistook 200
Is to mistake again; though indirect,
Yet indirection thereby grows direct,
And falsehood falsehood cures, as fire cools fire
Within the scorch
It is religion that doth make vows kept;
But thou hast sworn against religion;
By what thou swear’st, against the thing thou
swear‘st;
And mak’st an oath the surety for thy troth:
Against an oath, the truth. Thou art unsure
To swear: swear’st only not to be forsworn—210
Else what a mockery should it be to swear!—
But thou dost swear only to be forsworn,
And most forsworn to keep what thou dost swear;
Therefore thy later vows against thy first
Is in thyself rebellion to thyself, 215
And better conquest never canst thou make
Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts
Against these giddy loose suggestions;
Upon which better part our prayers come in
If thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then know 220
The peril of our curses light on thee
So heavy as thou shalt not shake them off,
But in despair die under their black weight.
