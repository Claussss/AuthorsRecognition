Ah, Warwick—Montague hath breathed his last,
And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick,
And said ‘Commend me to my valiant brother.’
And more he would have said, and more he spoke,
Which sounded like a canon in a vault,
That mote not be distinguished; but at last
I well might hear, delivered with a groan,
‘O, farewell, Warwick.’
