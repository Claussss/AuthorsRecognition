FIRST SENATOR Noble and young, When thy first griefs were but a mere conceit,
Ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear,
We sent to thee to give thy rages balm,
To wipe out our ingratitude with loves
Above their quantity. SECOND SENATOR So did we woo Transformed Timon to our cityâ€™s love
By humble message and by promised means.
We were not all unkind, nor all deserve
The common stroke of war.
