JULIA (aside) If ’twere a substance, you would sure deceive it
And make it but a shadow, as I am. I am very loath to be your idol, sir,
But since your falsehood shall become you well
To worship shadows and adore false shapes,
Send to me in the morning, and I’ll send it.
And so, good rest. Exit As wretches have o’ernight,
