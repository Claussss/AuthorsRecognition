Ha? ‘Tis he indeed. Is this the honour they do one another?
’Tis well there’s one above ’em yet. I had thought
They had parted so much honesty among ’em—
At least good manners—as not thus to suffer
A man of his place and so near our favour
To dance attendance on their lordships’ pleasures,
And at the door, too, like a post with packets!
By holy Mary, Butts, there’s knavery!
Let ’em alone, and draw the curtain close.
We shall hear more anon.
