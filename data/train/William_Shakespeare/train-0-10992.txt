Give me your arm. Up, so. How is’t? Feel you your legs? You stand. Too well, too well. This is above all strangeness. Upon the crown o’th’ cliff what thing was that
Which parted from you? A poor unfortunate beggar. As I stood here below, methoughts his eyes
Were two full moons. He had a thousand noses,
Horns whelked and waved like the enraged sea.
It was some fiend. Therefore, thou happy father,
Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours
Of men’s impossibilities, have preserved thee.
