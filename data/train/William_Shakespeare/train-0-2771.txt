HERALD I go. Enter a Herald from the Dauphin (Prince Charles of Normandy) PRINCE OF WALES What news with thee? SECOND HERALD The Duke of Normandy, my lord and master,
Pitying thy youth is so engirt with peril,
By me hath sent a nimble-jointed jennet,
As swift as ever yet thou didst bestride,
And therewithal he counsels thee to fly,
Else death himself hath sworn that thou shalt die.
