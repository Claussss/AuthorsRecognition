Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern  Friends both, go join you with some further aid.
Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
And from his motherâ€™s closet hath he dragged him.
Go seek him out, speak fair, and bring the body
Into the chapel. I pray you haste in this. Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
