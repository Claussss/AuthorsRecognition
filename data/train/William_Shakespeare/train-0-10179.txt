O noble fellow, Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword
And, when it bows, stand‘st up! Thou art lost, Martius.
A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,
Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier
Even to Cato’s wish, not fierce and terrible
Only in strokes, but with thy grim looks and
The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds
Thou mad’st thine enemies shake as if the world
Were feverous and did tremble.
