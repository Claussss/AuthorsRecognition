COUNTESS OF SALISBURY Nay, you’ll do more. You’ll make the river too
With their heart bloods that keep our love asunder,
Of which my husband and your wife are twain. KING EDWARD Thy beauty makes them guilty of their death,
And gives in evidence that they shall die—
Upon which verdict I, their judge, condemn them.
