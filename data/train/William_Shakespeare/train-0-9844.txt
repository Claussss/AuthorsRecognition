LAFEU (to Bertram) Your reputation comes too short for my daughter, you are no husband for her. BERTRAM (to the King) My lord, this is a fond and despâ€™rate creature
Whom sometime I have laughed with. Let your
highness
Lay a more noble thought upon mine honour
Than for to think that I would sink it here.
