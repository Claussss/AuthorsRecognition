CORDELIA Nothing, my lord. How? Nothing can come of nothing. Speak again. Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave
My heart into my mouth. I love your majesty
According to my bond, nor more nor less. Go to, go to, mend your speech a little
Lest it may mar your fortunes. CORDELIA Good my lord, You have begot me, bred me, loved me.
I return those duties back as are right fitâ€”
Obey you, love you, and most honour you.
Why have my sisters husbands if they say
They love you all? Haply when I shall wed
That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry
Half my love with him, half my care and duty.
Sure, I shall never marry like my sisters,
To love my father all.
