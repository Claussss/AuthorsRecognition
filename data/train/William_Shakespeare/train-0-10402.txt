MENENIUS Pray now, your news? (To the tribunes) You have made fair work, I fear me.
(To Cominius) Pray, your news.
If Martius should be joined wi’th’ Volscians— If? He is their god. He leads them like a thing
Made by some other deity than nature,
That shapes man better, and they follow him
Against us brats with no less confidence
Than boys pursuing summer butterflies,
Or butchers killing flies.
