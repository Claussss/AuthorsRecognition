Duke of Alen
That, being captain of the watch tonight,
Did look no better to that weighty charge. Had all your quarters been as safely kept
As that whereof I had the government,
We had not been thus shamefully surprised. Mine was secure. And for myself, most part of all this night
Within her quarter and mine own precinct
I was employed in passing to and fro
About relieving of the sentinels.
Then how or which way should they first break in?
