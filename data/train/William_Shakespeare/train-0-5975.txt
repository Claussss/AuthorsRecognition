Enter Servant
What say the augurers? They would not have you to stir forth today.
Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,
They could not find a heart within the beast. The gods do this in shame of cowardice.
Caesar should be a beast without a heart
If he should stay at home today for fear.
No, Caesar shall not. Danger knows full well
That Caesar is more dangerous than he.
We are two lions littered in one day,
And I the elder and more terrible.
And Caesar shall go forth.
