DUC DE LORRAINE Then, Edward, here, in spite of all thy lords,
I do pronounce defiance to thy face. PRINCE OF WALES Defiance, Frenchman? We rebound it back
Even to the bottom of thy master’s throat!
And, be it spoke with reverence of the King,
My gracious father, and these other lords,
I hold thy message but as scurrilous,
And him that sent thee like the lazy drone
Crept up by stealth unto the eagle’s nest,
From whence we’ll shake him with so rough a storm
As others shall be warned by his harm.
EARL OF WARWICK (to Lorraine)
Bid him leave off the lion’s case he wears
Lest, meeting with the lion in the field,
He chance to tear him piecemeal for his pride.
