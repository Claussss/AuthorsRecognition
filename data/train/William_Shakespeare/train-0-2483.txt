To spoil antiquities of hammered steel,
And turn the giddy round of fortune’s wheel; ‘To show the beldame daughters of her daughter,
To make the child a man, the man a child,
To slay the tiger that doth live by slaughter,
To tame the unicorn and lion wild,
To mock the subtle in themselves beguiled, To cheer the ploughman with increaseful crops,
And waste huge stones with little water drops.
