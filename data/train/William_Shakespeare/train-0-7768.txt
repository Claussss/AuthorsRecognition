Farewell, kind lord. God send us merry meeting. MORE Amen, my lord. Farewell, dear friend. I hope your safe return. My lord, and my dear fellow in the Muses,
Farewell. Farewell, most noble poet. Adieu, most honoured lords. Exeunt Lords Fair prison, welcome. Yet methinks
For thy fair building ‘tis too foul a name.
Many a guilty soul, and many an innocent,
Have breathed their farewell to thy hollow rooms.
I oft have entered into thee this way,
Yet, I thank God, ne’er with a clearer conscience
Than at this hour.
This is my comfort yet: how hard soe’er
My lodging prove, the cry of the poor suitor,
Fatherless orphan, or distress
Shall not disturb me in my quiet sleep.
On then, i’ God’s name, to our close abode.
God is as strong here as he is abroad.
