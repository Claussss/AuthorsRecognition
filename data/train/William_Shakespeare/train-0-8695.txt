EDGAR (aside) O, matter and impertinency mixed—
Reason in madness! If thou wilt weep my fortune, take my eyes.
I know thee well enough: thy name is Gloucester.
Thou must be patient. We came crying hither.
Thou know’st the first time that we smell the air
We wail and cry. I will preach to thee. Mark me.
