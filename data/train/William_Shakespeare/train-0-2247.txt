My smooth moist hand, were it with thy hand felt,
Would in thy palm dissolve, or seem to melt. â€˜Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear;
Or like a fairy, trip upon the green;
Or like a nymph, with long, dishevelled hair,
Dance on the sands, and yet no footing seen. Love is a spirit all compact of fire,
Not gross to sink, but light, and will aspire.
