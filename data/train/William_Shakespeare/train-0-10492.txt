By this we gather You have tripped since. O my most sacred lady, Temptations have since then been born to’s; for
In those unfledged days was my wife a girl.
Your precious self had then not crossed the eyes
Of my young playfellow. Grace to boot! Of this make no conclusion, lest you say
Your queen and I are devils. Yet go on.
Th’offences we have made you do we’ll answer,
If you first sinned with us, and that with us
You did continue fault, and that you slipped not
With any but with us.
