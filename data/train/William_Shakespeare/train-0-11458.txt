I will resist such entertainment till
Mine enemy has more power. He draws, and is charmed from moving O dear father, Make not too rash a trial of him, for
He’s gentle, and not fearful. What, I say, My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor,
Who mak‘st a show but dar’st not strike, thy
conscience
Is so possessed with guilt. Come from thy ward,
For I can here disarm thee with this stick
And make thy weapon drop.
