AARON (aside) Clubs, clubs! These lovers will not keep the peace. Why, boy, although our mother, unadvised,
Gave you a dancing-rapier by your side,
Are you so desperate grown to threat your friends?
Go to, have your lath glued within your sheath
Till you know better how to handle it. Meanwhile, sir, with the little skill I have
Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare.
