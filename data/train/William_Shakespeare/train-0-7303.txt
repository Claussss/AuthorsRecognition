TROILUS Away, away! Farewell. Yet soft: Hector, I take my leave.
Thou dost thyself and all our Troy deceive. Exit HECTOR (to Priam) You are amazed, my liege, at her exclaim.
Go in and cheer the town. Weâ€™ll forth and fight,
Do deeds of praise, and tell you them at night. Farewell. The gods with safety stand about thee.
