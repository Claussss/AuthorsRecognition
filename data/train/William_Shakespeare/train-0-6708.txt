LAERTES (aside to Claudius) My lord, I’ll hit him now. KING CLAUDIUS (aside to Laertes) I do not think’t. LAERTES (aside) And yet ‘tis almost ’gainst my conscience. Come for the third, Laertes, you but dally.
I pray you pass with your best violence.
I am afeard you make a wanton of me. Say you so? Come on.
