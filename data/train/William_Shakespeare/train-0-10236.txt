SICINIUS I wish no better Than have him hold that purpose, and to put it
In execution. BRUTUS ’Tis most like he will. It shall be to him then, as our good wills,
A sure destruction. BRUTUS So it must fall out To him, or our authority’s for an end.
We must suggest the people in what hatred
He still hath held them; that to’s power he would
Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders,
And dispropertied their freedoms, holding them
In human action and capacity
Of no more soul nor fitness for the world
Than camels in their war, who have their provand
Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows
For sinking under them.
