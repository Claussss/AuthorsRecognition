Enter Capulet and the Nurse CAPULET’S WIFE Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself,
And see how he will take it at your hands. When the sun sets, the earth doth drizzle dew,
But for the sunset of my brother’s son
It rains downright.
How now, a conduit, girl? What, still in tears?
Evermore show‘ring? In one little body
Thou counterfeit’st a barque, a sea, a wind,
For still thy eyes—which I may call the sea—
Do ebb and flow with tears. The barque thy body is,
Sailing in this salt flood; the winds thy sighs,
Who, raging with thy tears and they with them,
Without a sudden calm will overset
Thy tempest-tossed body.—How now, wife?
Have you delivered to her our decree?
