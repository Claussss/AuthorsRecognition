My queen, my mistress! O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause
To be suspected of more tenderness
Than doth become a man. I will remain
The loyal‘st husband that did e’er plight troth;
My residence in Rome at one Filario’s,
Who to my father was a friend, to me
Known but by letter; thither write, my queen,
And with mine eyes I’ll drink the words you send
Though ink be made of gall.
