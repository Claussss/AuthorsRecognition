No, Master Lieutenant. I thank my God
I have peace of conscience, though the world and I
Are at a little odds. But weâ€™ll be even now, I hope,
Ere long. When is the execution of your warrant? Tomorrow morning. So, sir, I thank ye. I have not lived so ill I fear to die.
Master Lieutenant,
I have had a sore fit of the stone tonight;
But the King hath sent me such a rare receipt,
I thank him, as I shall not need to fear it much.
