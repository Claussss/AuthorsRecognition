Mine, full of sorrow and heart’s discontent. What! Has your king married the Lady Gray?
And now to soothe your forgery and his,
Sends me a paper to persuade me patience?
Is this th’alliance that he seeks with France?
Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner? QUEEN MARGARET I told your majesty as much before—
This proveth Edward’s love and Warwick’s honesty.
