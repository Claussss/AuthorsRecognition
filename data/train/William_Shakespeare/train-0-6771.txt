VALENTINE No, believe me. Enter the Duke, Curio, and attendants VIOLA I thank you. Here comes the Count. ORSINO Who saw Cesario, ho? VIOLA On your attendance, my lord, here. ORSINO (to Curio and attendants) Stand you a while aloof. (To Viola) Cesario,
Thou knowâ€™st no less but all. I have unclasped
To thee the book even of my secret soul.
Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her,
Be not denied access, stand at her doors,
And tell them there thy fixed foot shall grow
Till thou have audience.
