And undertake the teaching of the maid.
That’s your device. It is. May it be done? Not possible; for who shall bear your part,
And be in Padua here Vincentio’s son,
Keep house, and ply his book, welcome his friends,
Visit his countrymen, and banquet them? Basta, content thee, for I have it full.
We have not yet been seen in any house,
Nor can we be distinguished by our faces
For man or master. Then it follows thus:
Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead;
Keep house, and port, and servants, as I should.
I will some other be, some Florentine,
Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.
Tis hatched, and shall be so. Tranio, at once
Uncase thee. Take my coloured hat and cloak.
When Biondello comes he waits on thee,
But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.
