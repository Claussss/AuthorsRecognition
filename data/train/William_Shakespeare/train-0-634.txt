HORTENSIO (to Katherine) Say as he says or we shall never go. Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,
And be it moon or sun or what you please,
And if you please to call it a rush-candle
Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me. I say it is the moon. I know it is the moon. Nay then you lie, it is the blessed sun.
