HASTINGS
My liege, I’ll knock once more to summon them. He knocks. Enter, on the walls, the Mayor and aldermen of York My lords, we were forewarned of your coming,
And shut the gates for safety of oursetves—
For now we owe allegiance unto Henry. KING EDWARD But, Master Mayor, if Henry be your king,
Yet Edward at the least is Duke of York.
