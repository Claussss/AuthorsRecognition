But, my good lord, your graces’ word shall serve
As well as I had seen and heard him speak.
And do not doubt, right noble princes both,
But I’ll acquaint our duteous citizens
With all your just proceedings in this cause. RICHARD GLOUCESTER And to that end we wished your lordship here,
T’avoid the censures of the carping world.
