Give me mine own again. â€™Twere no good part
To take on me to keep and kill thy heart. So now I have mine own again, be gone,
That I may strive to kill it with a groan. We make woe wanton with this fond delay.
Once more, adieu. The rest let sorrow say. Exeunt FRichard, guarded, and Northumberland at one door, the Queen and her Ladies at another door
