Let ord’nance Come as the gods foresay it; howsoe’er,
My brother hath done well. I had no mind To hunt this day. The boy Fidele’s sickness
Did make my way long forth. With his own sword, Which he did wave against my throat, I have ta’en
His head from him. I’ll throw’t into the creek
Behind our rock, and let it to the sea
And tell the fishes he’s the Queen’s son, Cloten.
That’s all I reck.
