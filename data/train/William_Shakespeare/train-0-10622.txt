To chide at your extremes it not becomes me—
O, pardon that I name them! Your high self,
The gracious mark o’th’ land, you have obscured
With a swain’s wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,
Most goddess-like pranked up. But that our feasts
In every mess have folly, and the feeders
Digest it with a custom, I should blush
To see you so attired; swoon, I think,
To show myself a glass.
