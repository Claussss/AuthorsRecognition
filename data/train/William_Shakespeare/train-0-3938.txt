Stay, gentle Helena, hear my excuse,
My love, my life, my soul, fair Helena. O excellent! HERMIA (to Lysander) Sweet, do not scorn her so. DEMETRIUS (to Lysander) If she cannot entreat I can compel. Thou canst compel no more than she entreat.
Thy threats have no more strength than her weak
prayers.â€”
Helen, I love thee; by my life I do.
I swear by that which I will lose for thee
To prove him false that says I love thee not.
