My brother was too careless of his charge.
(To King Henry) But let us hence, my sovereign, to
provide
A salve for any sore that may betide. Exeunt all but Somerset, Richmond, and Oxford SOMERSET (to Oxford) My lord, I like not of this flight of Edward’s,
For doubtless Burgundy will yield him help,
And we shall have more wars before’t be long.
As Henry’s late presaging prophecy
Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond,
So doth my heart misgive me, in these conflicts,
What may befall him, to his harm and ours.
Therefore, Lord Oxford, to prevent the worst,
Forthwith we’ll send him hence to Brittany,
Till storms be past of civil enmity.
