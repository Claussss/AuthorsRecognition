He throws it away.
Alarum continues still afar off. Enter Martius,
bleeding, and Lartius with a trumpeter. Exeunt
Romans with spoils See here these movers that do prize their honours
At a cracked drachma! Cushions, leaden spoons,
Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would
Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves,
Ere yet the fight be done, pack up. Down with them!
And hark what noise the general makes. To him.
There is the man of my soulâ€™s hate, Aufidius,
Piercing our Romans. Then, valiant Titus, take
Convenient numbers to make good the city,
Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste
To help Cominius.
