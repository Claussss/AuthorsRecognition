SECOND LORD DUMAINE I must go look my twigs. He shall be caught. Your brother, he shall go along with me. Now will I lead you to the house, and show you 111
The lass I spoke of. That’s all the fault. I spoke with her but once
And found her wondrous cold, but I sent to her
By this same coxcomb that we have i’th’ wind 115
Tokens and letters, which she did re-send,
And this is all I have done. She’s a fair creature.
Will you go see her?
