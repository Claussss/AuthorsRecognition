Enter Antony and Camidius Nay, I have done. Here comes the Emperor. Is it not strange, Camidius, That from Tarentum and Brundisium
He could so quickly cut the Ionian Sea
And take in Toryne?—You have heard on’t, sweet? Celerity is never more admired
Than by the negligent. A good rebuke, Which might have well becomed the best of men
To taunt at slackness. Camidius, we
Will fight with him by sea.
