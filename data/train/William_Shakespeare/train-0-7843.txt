FIRST GENTLEMAN Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of Hungary’s! SECOND GENTLEMAN Amen. LUCIO Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate, that went to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scraped one out of the table. SECOND GENTLEMAN ‘Thou shalt not steal’? LUCIO Ay, that he razed. FIRST GENTLEMAN Why, ’twas a commandment to command the captain and all the rest from their functions: they put forth to steal. There’s not a soldier of us all that in the thanksgiving before meat do relish the petition well that prays for peace. 16
