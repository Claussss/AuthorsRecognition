SECOND CAPTAIN Sound, trumpet! Trumpeter sounds HERALD (reads) ‘If any man of quality or degree in the host of the army will maintain upon Edmund, supposed Earl of Gloucester, that he’s a manifold traitor, let him appear at the third sound of the trumpet. He is bold in his defence.’ EDMUND Sound! (Trumpeter sounds) Again!
