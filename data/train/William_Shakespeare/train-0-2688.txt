The Countess stands (Calling) Warwick, my son, Derby, Artois and Audley—
Brave warriors all, where are you all this while? Enter all the peers: the Earl of Warwick, the
Prince of Wales, the Earl of Derby, the Comte d’Artois
and Lord Audley Warwick, I make thee Warden of the North.
Thou, Prince of Wales, and Audley, straight to sea,
Scour to Newhaven—some there stay for me.
Myself, Artois and Derby will through Flanders
To greet our friends there and to crave their aid.
This night will scarce suffice me to discover
My folly’s siege against a faithful lover,
For ere the sun shall gild the eastern sky
We’ll wake him with our martial harmony.
