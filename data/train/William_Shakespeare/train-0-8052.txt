My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm.
She hath been a suitor to me for her brother,
Cut off by course of justice. ISABELLA standing By course of justice! And she will speak most bitterly and strange. Most strange, but yet most truly, will I speak.
That Angelo’s forsworn, is it not strange?
That Angelo’s a murderer, is’t not strange?
That Angelo is an adulterous thief,
An hypocrite, a virgin-violator,
Is it not strange, and strange?
