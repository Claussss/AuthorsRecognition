Welcome, lady. MAECENAS Welcome, dear madam. Each heart in Rome does love and pity you.
Only th’adulterous Antony, most large
In his abominations, turns you off,
And gives his potent regiment to a trull
That noises it against us. Is it so, sir? Most certain. Sister, welcome. Pray you
Be ever known to patience. My dear’st sister!
