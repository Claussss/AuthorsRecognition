My gracious sovereign, Howe’er it pleases you to take it so,
The ring was never hers. Son, on my life I have seen her wear it, and she reckoned it
At her life’s rate. I am sure I saw her wear it. You are deceived, my lord, she never saw it.
In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,
Wrapped in a paper which contained the name
Of her that threw it. Noble she was, and thought
I stood ingaged. But when I had subscribed
To mine own fortune, and informed her fully
I could not answer in that course of honour
As she had made the overture, she ceased
In heavy satisfaction, and would never
Receive the ring again.
