Exit Duke Theseus with Hippolyta, Egeus, and all his train These things seem small and undistinguishable,
Like far-off mountains turned into clouds. Methinks I see these things with parted eye,
When everything seems double. HELENA So methinks, And I have found Demetrius like a jewel,
Mine own and not mine own.
