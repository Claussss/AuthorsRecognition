DOCTOR Madam, do you; ’tis fittest. CORDELIA (to Lear) How does my royal lord? How fares your majesty? You do me wrong to take me out o’th’ grave.
Thou art a soul in bliss, but I am bound
Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears
Do scald like molten lead. CORDELIA Sir, know me. You’re a spirit, I know. Where did you die?
