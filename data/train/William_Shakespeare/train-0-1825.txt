Why art thou thus attired, Andronicus? Because I would be sure to have all well
To entertain your highness and your Empress. We are beholden to you, good Andronicus. An if your highness knew my heart, you were.
My lord the Emperor, resolve me this:
Was it well done of rash Virginius
To slay his daughter with his own right hand
Because she was enforced, stained, and deflowered?
