Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands—
For, well I wot, thou hast thy mother’s tongue. QUEEN MARGARET But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam,
But like a foul misshapen stigmatic,
Marked by the destinies to be avoided,
As venom toads or lizards’ dreadful stings. Iron of Naples, hid with English gilt,
Whose father bears the title of a king—
As if a channel should be called the sea—
Sham’st thou not, knowing whence thou art
extraught,
To let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart?
