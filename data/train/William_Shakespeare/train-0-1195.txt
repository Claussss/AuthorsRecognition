Now, Warwick, tell me even upon thy conscience,
Is Edward your true king? For I were loath
To link with him that were not lawful chosen. Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour. But is he gracious in the peopleâ€™s eye? The more that Henry was unfortunate. Then further, all dissembling set aside,
Tell me for truth the measure of his love
Unto our sister Bona.
