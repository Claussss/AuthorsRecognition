PALAMON You love her then? ARCITE Who would not? PALAMON And desire her? ARCITE Before my liberty. I saw her first. That’s nothing. But it shall be. I saw her too. Yes, but you must not love her. I will not, as you do, to worship her
As she is heavenly and a bless
I love her as a woman, to enjoy her—
So both may love.
