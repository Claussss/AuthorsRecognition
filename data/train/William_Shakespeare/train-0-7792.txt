O, I had hoped we should not yet have parted! But I must leave ye for a little while.
Within an hour or two you may look for me.
But there will be so many come to see me
That I shall be so proud I will not speak;
And sure my memory is grown so ill
I fear I shall forget my head behind me. God and his blessed angels be about ye!â€”
Here, Master Sheriffs, receive your prisoner.
