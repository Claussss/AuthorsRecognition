JAQUES More, more, I prithee, more. AMIENS It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques. JAQUES I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck melancholy out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs. More, I prithee, more. AMIENS My voice is ragged, I know I cannot please you. JAQUES I do not desire you to please me, I do desire you to sing. Come, more; another stanza. Call you â€™em stanzas?
