Their smoothness like a goodly champaign plain
Lays open all the little worms that creep;
In men as in a rough-grown grove remain
Cave-keeping evils that obscurely sleep.
Through crystal walls each little mote will peep; Though men can cover crimes with bold stern looks,
Poor women’s faces are their own faults’ books.
