EDGAR Let’s exchange charity. I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund.
If more, the more ignobly thou hast wronged me. [He
takes off his
helmet] My name is Edgar, and thy father’s son.
The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices
Make instruments to scourge us.
The dark and vicious place where thee he got
Cost him his eyes.
