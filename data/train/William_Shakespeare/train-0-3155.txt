Soft, whither away so fast? A true man or a thief, that gallops so? I post from love; good lover, let me go. God bless the King! KING What present hast thou there? Some certain treason. KING What makes treason here? Nay, it makes nothing, sir. KING If it mar nothing neither, The treason and you go in peace away together!
