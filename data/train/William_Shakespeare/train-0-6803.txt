I see you what you are, you are too proud,
But if you were the devil, you are fair.
My lord and master loves you. O, such love
Could be but recompensed though you were crowned
The nonpareil of beauty. How does he love me? With adorations, fertile tears,
With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.
