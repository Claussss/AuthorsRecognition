FOOL (to Lear) For, you know, nuncle, Sings
That itâ€™s had it head bit off by it young;
so out went the candle, and we were left darkling. LEAR (to Goneril) Are you our daughter? I would you would make use of your good wisdom,
Whereof I know you are fraught, and put away
These dispositions which of late transport you
From what you rightly are.
