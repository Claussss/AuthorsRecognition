What please yourself, sir. I have made it for you. ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Made it for me, sir? I bespoke it not. Not once, nor twice, but twenty times you have.
Go home with it, and please your wife withal,
And soon at supper-time Iâ€™ll visit you,
And then receive my money for the chain. ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
