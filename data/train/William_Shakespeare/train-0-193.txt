Thomas Bancroft, Two Books of Epigrams and
Epitaphs (1639) 
To Master William Shakespeare Shakespeare, we must be silent in thy praise,
 ‘Cause our encomiums will but blast thy bays,
 Which envy could not; that thou didst so well,
 Let thine own histories prove thy chronicle. Anonymous, in Wit’s Recreations (1640)
