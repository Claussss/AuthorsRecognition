I am almost afraid to stand alone 10
Here in the churchyard, yet I will adventure. He hides himself at a distance from Paris PARIS (strewing flowers) Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew. He sprinkles water  O woe! Thy canopy is dust and stones,
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
Or, wanting that, with tears distilled by moans.
The obsequies that I for thee will keep
Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
