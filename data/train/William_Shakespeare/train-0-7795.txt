O, is this the place?
I promise ye, it is a goodly scaffold.
In sooth, I am come about a headless errand,
For I have not much to say, now I am here.
Well, let’s ascend, i’ God’s name.
In troth, methinks your stair is somewhat weak.
[To the Hangman] I prithee, honest friend, lend me thy
hand
To help me up. As for my coming down,
Let me alone, I’ll look to that myself.
