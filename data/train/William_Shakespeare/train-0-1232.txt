Our scouts have found the adventure very easy;
That, as Ulysses and stout Diomed
With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus’ tents
And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds,
So we, well covered with the night’s black mantle,
At unawares may beat down Edward’s guard
And seize himself—I say not ‘slaughter him’,
For I intend but only to surprise him.
You that will follow me to this attempt,
Applaud the name of Henry with your leader.
