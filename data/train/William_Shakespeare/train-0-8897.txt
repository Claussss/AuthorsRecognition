FIRST SENATOR We are for law; he dies. Urge it no more,
On height of our displeasure. Friend or brother,
He forfeits his own blood that spills another. Must it be so? It must not be.
My lords, I do beseech you know me. SECOND SENATOR How? Call me to your remembrances. THIRD SENATOR What? I cannot think but your age has forgot me.
It could not else be I should prove so base
To sue and be denied such common grace.
My wounds ache at you.
