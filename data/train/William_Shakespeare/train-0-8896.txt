FIRST SENATOR ALCIBIADES Hard fate! He might have died in war. My lords, if not for any parts in him—
Though his right arm might purchase his own time
And be in debt to none—yet more to move you,
Take my deserts to his and join ’em both.
And for I know
Your reverend ages love security,
I’ll pawn my victories, all my honour to you
Upon his good returns.
If by this crime he owes the law his life,
Why, let the war receive’t in valiant gore,
For law is strict, and war is nothing more.
