FRIAR LAURENCE Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift.
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift. Then plainly know my heart’s dear love is set
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet.
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,
And all combined save what thou must combine
By holy marriage. When and where and how
We met, we wooed, and made exchange of vow
I’ll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
That thou consent to marry us today.
