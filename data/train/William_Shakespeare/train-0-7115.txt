AGAMEMNON (to Patroclus) Where is Achilles? Within his tent; but ill-disposed, my lord. Let it be known to him that we are here.
He faced our messengers, and we lay by
Our appertainments, visiting of him.
Let him be told so, lest perchance he think
We dare not move the question of our place,
Or know not what we are.
