OTHELLO Dost thou say so? She did deceive her father, marrying you,
And when she seemed to shake and fear your looks
She loved them most. OTHELLO And so she did. IAGO Why, go to, then. She that so young could give out such a seeming,
To seel her father’s eyes up close as oak,
He thought ’twas witchcraft! But I am much to blame.
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
For too much loving you.
