Madam, in happy time. What day is that? CAPULET’S WIFE Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn
The gallant, young, and noble gentleman
The County Paris at Saint Peter’s Church
Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride. Now, by Saint Peter’s Church, and Peter too,
He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
I wonder at this haste, that I must wed
Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.
I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear
It shall be Romeo—whom you know I hate—
Rather than Paris. These are news indeed.
