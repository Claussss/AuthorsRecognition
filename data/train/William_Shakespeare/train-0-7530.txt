 Written upon the West end thereof Not monumental stone preserves our fame,
Nor sky-aspiring pyramids our name.
The memory of him for whom this stands
Shall outlive marble and defacers’ hands.
When all to time’s consumption shall be given,
Stanley for whom this stands shall stand in heaven. 
On Ben Jonson
