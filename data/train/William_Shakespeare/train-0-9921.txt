SECOND FISHERMAN Honest, good fellow? What’s that? If it be a day fits you, scratch’t out of the calendar, and nobody look after it. May see the sea hath cast upon your coast— SECOND FISHERMAN What a drunken knave was the sea to cast thee in our way! A man, whom both the waters and the wind
In that vast tennis-court hath made the ball
For them to play upon, entreats you pity him.
He asks of you that never used to beg.
