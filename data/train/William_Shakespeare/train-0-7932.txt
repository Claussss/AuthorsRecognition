ISABELLA Under your sentence? ANGELO Yea. When, I beseech you?—that in his reprieve,
Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted
That his soul sicken not. Ha, fie, these filthy vices! It were as good
To pardon him that hath from nature stolen
A man already made, as to remit
Their saucy sweetness that do coin God’s image
In stamps that are forbid. ’Tis all as easy
Falsely to take away a life true made
As to put metal in restrained moulds,
To make a false one.
