OFFICER (to Brabanzio) ’Tis true, most worthy signor. The Duke’s in council, and your noble self,
I am sure, is sent for. How, the Duke in council? In this time of the night? Bring him away.
Mine’s not an idle cause. The Duke himself,
Or any of my brothers of the state,
Cannot but feel this wrong as ’twere their own;
For if such actions may have passage free,
Bondslaves and pagans shall our statesmen be. Exeunt
