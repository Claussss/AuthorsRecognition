But we are spirits of another sort.
I with the morningâ€™s love have oft made sport,
And like a forester the groves may tread

Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams
Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.
But notwithstanding, haste, make no delay;
We may effect this business yet ere day. Exit
