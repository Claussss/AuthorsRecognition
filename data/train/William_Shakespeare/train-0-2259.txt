Poor queen of love, in thine own law forlorn,
To love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn! Now which way shall she turn? What shall she say?
Her words are done, her woes the more increasing.
The time is spent; her object will away,
And from her twining arms doth urge releasing. ‘Pity,’ she cries; ‘some favour, some remorse!’
Away he springs, and hasteth to his horse.
