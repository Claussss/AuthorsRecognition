SECOND MURDERER Whom thou wast sworn to cherish and defend. FIRST MURDERER How canst thou urge God’s dreadful law to us, When thou hast broke it in such dear degree? Alas, for whose sake did I that ill deed?
For Edward, for my brother, for his sake.
He sends ye not to murder me for this,
For in that sin he is as deep as I.
If God will be avenged for the deed,
O know you yet, he doth it publicly.
Take not the quarrel from his pow’rful arm;
He needs no indirect or lawless course
To cut off those that have offended him.
