You shall, Mark Antony. CASSIUS Brutus, a word with you. (Aside to Brutus) You know not what you do. Do not
consent
That Antony speak in his funeral.
Know you how much the people may be moved
By that which he will utter? BRUTUS (aside to Cassius) By your pardon, I will myself into the pulpit first,
And show the reason of our Caesarâ€™s death.
What Antony shall speak I will protest
He speaks by leave and by permission;
And that we are contented Caesar shall
Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies,
It shall advantage more than do us wrong.
