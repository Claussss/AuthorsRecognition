Master Ben Jonson and Master William Shakespeare
being merry at a tavern, Master Jonson having begun
this for his epitaph: Here lies Ben Jonson
That was once one, he gives it to Master Shakespeare to make up who
presently writes: Who while he lived was a slow thing,
And now, being dead, is nothing. 
 An Epitaph on Elias James
