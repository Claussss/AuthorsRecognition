Be this the whetstone of your sword. Let grief
Convert to anger: blunt not the heart, enrage it. O, I could play the woman with mine eyes
And braggart with my tongue! But gentle heavens
Cut short all intermission. Front to front
Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself.
Within my swordâ€™s length set him. If he scape,
Heaven forgive him too.
