Ay, I must have thee proud, or else thou‘lt ne’er
Be near allied to greatness. Observe me, sir.
The learn
Within our English court. This day, I hear,
He feasteth with an English honoured poet
The Earl of Surrey, and I know this night 10
The famous clerk of Rotterdam will visit
Sir Thomas More. Therefore, sir, act my part.
There, take my place furnished with purse and mace.
I’ll see if great Erasmus can distinguish
Merit and outward ceremony. Observe me, sirrah.
I’ll be thy glass. Dress thy behaviour
According to my carriage. But beware
Thou talk not overmuch, for ‘twill betray thee.
Who prates not oft seems wise, his wit few scan,
Whilst the tongue blabs tales of th’imperfect man.
