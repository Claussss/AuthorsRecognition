ARCITE One farewell. Why, let it be so—farewell, coz. Farewell, sir. Exeunt Palamon and his three Knights Knights, kinsmen, lovers—yea, my sacrifices,
True worshippers of Mars, whose spirit in you
Expels the seeds of fear and th’apprehension
Which still is father of it, go with me
Before the god of our profession. There
Require of him the hearts of lions and
The breath of tigers, yea, the fierceness too,
Yea, the speed also—to go on, I mean,
Else wish we to be snails. You know my prize
Must be dragged out of blood—force and great feat
Must put my garland on me, where she sticks,
The queen of flowers. Our intercession, then,
Must be to him that makes the camp a cistern
Brimmed with the blood of men—give me your aid,
And bend your spirits towards him.
