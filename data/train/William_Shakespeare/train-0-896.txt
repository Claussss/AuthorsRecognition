The gaudy, blabbing, and remorseful day
Is crept into the bosom of the sea ;
And now loud-howling wolves arouse the jades
That drag the tragic melancholy night;
Who, with their drowsy, slow, and flagging wings
Clip dead menâ€™s graves, and from their misty jaws
Breathe foul contagious darkness in the air.
Therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize,
For whilst our pinnace anchors in the downs,
Here shall they make their ransom on the sand,
Or with their blood stain this discoloured shore.
Master, (pointing to the First Gentleman) this prisoner
freely give I thee,
(To the Mate)
And thou, that art his mate, make boot of this.
