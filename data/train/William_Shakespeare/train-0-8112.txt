Enter Isabella Very well met.
What is the news from this good deputy? He hath a garden circummured with brick,
Whose western side is with a vineyard backed;
And to that vineyard is a planck
That makes his opening with this bigger key.
This other doth command a little door
Which from the vineyard to the garden leads.
There have I made my promise
Upon the heavy middle of the night
To call upon him.
