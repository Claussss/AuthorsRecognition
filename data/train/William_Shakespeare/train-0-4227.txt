A trumpet sounds  And even there methinks an angel spake! Enter Cardinal Pandolf  Look where the holy legate comes apace,
To give us warrant from the hand of heaven,
And on our actions set the name of right
With holy breath. PANDOLF Hail, noble prince of France! The next is this. King John hath reconciled
Himself to Rome; his spirit is come in
That so stood out against the Holy Church,
The great metropolis and See of Rome;
Therefore thy threatâ€™ning colours now wind up,
And tame the savage spirit of wild war,
That like a lion fostered up at hand
It may lie gently at the foot of peace,
And be no further harmful than in show.
