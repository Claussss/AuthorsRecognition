Faith, my lord, I hear of none but the new proclamation
That’s clapped upon the court gate. LORD CHAMBERLAIN What is’t for? The reformation of our travelled gallants
That fill the court with quarrels, talk, and tailors. LORD CHAMBERLAIN I’m glad ’tis there. Now I would pray our ’messieurs’
To think an English courtier may be wise
And never see the Louvre.
