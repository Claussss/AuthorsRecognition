I gave her such a one. ’Twas my first gift. I know not that, but such a handkerchief—
I am sure it was your wife’s—did I today
See Cassio wipe his beard with. OTHELLO If it be that— If it be that, or any that was hers,
It speaks against her with the other proofs. O that the slave had forty thousand lives!
One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.
Now do I see ‘tis true. Look here, Iago.
All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven—’tis gone.
Arise, black vengeance, from the hollow hell.
Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne
To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy freight,
For ’tis of aspics’ tongues.
