What’s the cause? LORD CHAMBERLAIN It seems the marriage with his brother’s wife
Has crept too near his conscience. No, his conscience Has crept too near another lady. This is the Cardinal’s doing. The King-Cardinal,
That blind priest, like the eldest son of fortune,
Turns what he list. The King will know him one day.
