Then, gentle shadow—truth I must confess—
I railed on thee, fearing my love’s decease. “Tis not my fault; the boar provoked my tongue.
Be wreaked on him, invisible commander.
’Tis he, foul creature, that hath done thee wrong.
I did but act; he’s author of thy slander. Grief hath two tongues, and never woman yet
Could rule them both, without ten women’s wit.’
