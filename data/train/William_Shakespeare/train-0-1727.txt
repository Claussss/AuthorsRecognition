If any power pities wretched tears,
To that I call. (To Lavinia, who kneels) What, wouldst
thou kneel with me?
Do then, dear heart; for heaven shall hear our prayers,
Or with our sighs weâ€™ll breathe the welkin dim
And stain the sun with fog, as sometime clouds
When they do hug him in their melting bosoms.
