KING EDWARD (to Warwick) That is thy daughter, Warwick, is it not?
Whose husband hath in Bretagne served so long
About the planting of Lord Montfort there? EARL OF WARWICK It is, my lord. KING EDWARD Ignoble David, hast thou none to grieve
But seely ladies with thy threat’ning arms?
But I will make you shrink your snaily horns.
(To Audley) First, therefore, Audley, this shall be thy charge:
Go levy footmen for our wars in France.
(To the Prince of Wales) And, Ned, take muster of our men-at-arms.
In every shire elect a several band.
Let them be soldiers of a lusty spirit,
Such as dread nothing but dishonour’s blot.
Be wary therefore, since we do commence
A famous war, and with so mighty a nation.
(To Derby) Derby, be thou ambassador for us
Unto our father-in-law, the Earl of Hainault.
Make him acquainted with our enterprise,
And likewise will him, with our own allies
That are in Flanders, to solicit, too,
The Emperor of Almagne in our name.
Myself, whilst you are jointly thus employed,
Will, with these forces that I have at hand,
March and once more repulse the traitorous Scot.
But sirs, be resolute. We shall have wars
On every side. (To the Prince of Wales) And, Ned, thou must begin
Now to forget thy study and thy books,
And ure thy shoulders to an armour’s weight.
