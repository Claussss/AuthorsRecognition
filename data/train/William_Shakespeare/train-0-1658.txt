Prince Bassianus, leave to plead my deeds.
â€˜Tis thou and those that have dishonoured me. Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge
How I have loved and honoured Saturnine! TAMORA (to Saturninus) My worthy lord, if ever Tamora
Were gracious in those princely eyes of thine,
Then hear me speak indifferently for all;
And at my suit, sweet, pardon what is past.
