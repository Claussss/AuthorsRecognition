EDGAR Some villain hath done me wrong. EDMUND Thatâ€™s my fear, brother. I advise you to the best. Go armed. I am no honest man if there be any good meaning towards you. I have told you what I have seen and heard but faintly, nothing like the image and horror of it. Pray you, away. EDGAR Shall I hear from you anon?
