OTHELLO Ha? EMILIA Do thy worst. This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven
Than thou wast worthy her. OTHELLO Peace, you were best. Thou hast not half that power to do me harm
As I have to be hurt. O gull, O dolt,
As ignorant as dirt! Thou hast done a deed—
I care not for thy sword, I’ll make thee known
Though I lost twenty lives. Help, help, hot Help!
The Moor hath killed my mistress. Murder, murder!
