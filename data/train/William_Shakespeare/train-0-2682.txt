KING EDWARD Their opposition is beyond our law. COUNTESS OF SALISBURY So is your desire. If the law
Can hinder you to execute the one,
Let it forbid you to attempt the other.
I cannot think you love me as you say
Unless you do make good what you have sworn. KING EDWARD No more. Thy husband and the Queen shall die.
Fairer thou art by far than Hero was;
Beardless Leander not so strong as I.
He swam an easy current for his love,
But I will through a Hellespont of blood
To arrive at Sestos, where my Hero lies.
