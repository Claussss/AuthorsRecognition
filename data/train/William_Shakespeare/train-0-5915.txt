What means this shouting? I do fear the people
Choose Caesar for their king. Ay, do you fear it? Then must I think you would not have it so. I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.
But wherefore do you hold me here so long?
What is it that you would impart to me?
If it be aught toward the general good,
Set honour in one eye and death i’th’ other,
And I will look on both indifferently;
For let the gods so speed me as I love
The name of honour more than I fear death.
