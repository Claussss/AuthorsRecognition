Kent, on thy life, no more! My life I never held but as a pawn
To wage against thine enemies, ne’er feared to lose it,
Thy safety being motive. Out of my sight! See better, Lear, and let me still remain
The true blank of thine eye. Now, by Apollo— Now, by Apollo, King, thou swear’st thy gods in vain.
