SECOND OUTLAW Peace. Weâ€™ll hear him. THIRD OUTLAW Ay, by my beard will we. For he is a proper man. Then know that I have little wealth to lose.
A man I am, crossed with adversity.
My riches are these poor habiliments,
Of which if you should here disfurnish me
You take the sum and substance that I have.
