Night-wandâ€™ring weasels shriek to see him there.
They fright him, yet he still pursues his fear. As each unwilling portal yields him way,
Through little vents and crannies of the place
The wind wars with his torch to make him stay,
And blows the smoke of it into his face,
Extinguishing his conduct in this case.
