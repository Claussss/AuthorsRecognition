Exit the Lord Chamberlain King Henry draws the curtain, and sits reading
pensively How sad he looks! Sure he is much afflicted. Who’s there? Ha? Pray God he be not angry. Who’s there, I say? How dare you thrust yourselves
Into my private meditations!
Who am I? Ha? A gracious king that pardons all offences
Malice ne’er meant. Our breach of duty this way
Is business of estate, in which we come
To know your royal pleasure.
