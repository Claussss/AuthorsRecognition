ALBANY (to the others) Iâ€™ll overtake you. Exeunt both the armies Before you fight the battle, ope this letter.
If you have victory, let the trumpet sound
For him that brought it. Wretched though I seem,
I can produce a champion that will prove
What is avouch
Your business of the world hath so an end,
And machination ceases. Fortune love you.
