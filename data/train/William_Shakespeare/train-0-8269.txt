OTHELLO I am bound to thee for ever. I see this hath a little dashed your spirits. Not a jot, not a jot. IAGO I’faith, I fear it has. I hope you will consider what is spoke
Comes from my love. But I do see you’re moved.
I am to pray you not to strain my speech
To grosser issues, nor to larger reach
Than to suspicion.
