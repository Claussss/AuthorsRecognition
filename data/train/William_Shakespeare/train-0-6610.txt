KING CLAUDIUS to Guildenstern Follow him at foot. Tempt him with speed aboard. 56
Delay it not. I’ll have him hence tonight.
Away, for everything is sealed and done
That else leans on th’affair. Pray you, make haste. Exit Guildenstern And, England, if my love thou hold‘st at aught—
As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
Pays homage to us—thou mayst not coldly set
Our sovereign process, which imports at full,
By letters conjuring to that effect,
The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England,
For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
And thou must cure me. Till I know ’tis done,
Howe‘er my haps, my joys were ne’er begun.
