O my gentle cousin,  Hear’st thou the news abroad, who are arrived? 160 The French, my lord: men’s mouths are full of it.
Besides, I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury
With eyes as red as new-enkindled fire,
And others more, going to seek the grave
Of Arthur, whom they say is killed tonight
On your suggestion.
