Do not then walk too open. It doth not fit me. Hold, sir, hereâ€™s my purse.
In the south suburbs at the Elephant
Is best to lodge. I will bespeak our diet
Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge
With viewing of the town. There shall you have me. SEBASTIAN Why I your purse? Haply your eye shall light upon some toy
You have desire to purchase; and your store
I think is not for idle markets, sir.
