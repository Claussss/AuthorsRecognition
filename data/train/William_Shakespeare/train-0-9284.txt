Mine ear must pluck it thence. ‘Good friend,’ quoth he, ‘Say the firm Roman to great Egypt sends
This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,
To mend the petty present, I will piece
Her opulent throne with kingdoms. All the East,
Say thou, shall call her mistress.’ So he nodded,
And soberly did mount an arm-jaunced steed,
Who neighed so high that what I would have spoke
Was beastly dumbed by him.
