KING SIMONIDES It pleaseth me so well that I will see you wed,
Then with what haste you can, get you to bed. Exeunt Sc. 10
Enter Gower Now sleep y-slacked hath the rout,
No din but snores the house about,
Made louder by the o‘erfed breast
Of this most pompous marriage feast.
The cat with eyne of burning coal
Now couches fore the mouse’s hole,
And crickets sing at th’oven’s mouth
As the blither for their drouth.
Hymen hath brought the bride to bed,
Where by the loss of maidenhead
A babe is moulded. Be attent,
And time that is so briefly spent
With your fine fancies quaintly eche.
What’s dumb in show, I’ll plain with speech.
