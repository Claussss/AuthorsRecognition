Each hath his place and function to attend;
I am left out; for me, nothing remains.
But long I will not be Jack-out-of-office.
The King from Eltham I intend to steal,
And sit at chiefest stern of public weal. Exit 1.2
Sound a flourish. Enter Charles the Dauphin, the Duke of Alen Mars his true moving—even as in the heavens,
So in the earth—to this day is not known.
Late did he shine upon the English side;
Now we are victors: upon us he smiles.
What towns of any moment but we have?
At pleasure here we lie near Orl
Otherwhiles the famished English, like pale ghosts,
Faintly besiege us one hour in a month.
