O let their bodies follow, my dear liege,
With blood and sword and fire, to win your right.
In aid whereof, we of the spiritualty
Will raise your highness such a mighty sum
As never did the clergy at one time
Bring in to any of your ancestors. We must not only arm tâ€™invade the French,
But lay down our proportions to defend
Against the Scot, who will make raid upon us
With all advantages.
