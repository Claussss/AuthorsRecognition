REGAN (to Servants) Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell
His way to Dover. Exit one or more with Gloucester How isâ€™t, my lord? How look you? I have received a hurt. Follow me, lady.
(To Servants) Turn out that eyeless villain. Throw this
slave
Upon the dunghill. Regan, I bleed apace.
Untimely comes this hurt. Give me your arm.
