Flourish. Exeunt 1.5
Music. Enter the three Queens with the hearses of their lords in a funeral solemnity, with attendants Urns and odours, bring away,
Vapours, sighs, darken the day;
Our dole more deadly looks than dying.
Balms and gums and heavy cheers,
Sacred vials filled with tears,
And clamours through the wild air flying:
Come all sad and solemn shows,
That are quick-eyed pleasureâ€™s foes.
We convent naught else but woes,
We convent naught else but woes.
