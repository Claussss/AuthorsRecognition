As rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie,
Poor sacrifices of our enmity. A glooming peace this morning with it brings.
The sun for sorrow will not show his head. 305
Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things.
Some shall be pardoned, and some punish
For never was a story of more woe
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
