What do you pity, sir? Two creatures heartily. Am I one, sir? You look on me; what wreck discern you in me
Deserves your pity? Lamentablel What, To hide me from the radiant sun, and solace
I’th’ dungeon by a snuff? I pray you, sir, Deliver with more openness your answers
To my demands. Why do you pity me?
