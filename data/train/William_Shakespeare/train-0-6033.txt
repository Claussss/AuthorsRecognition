We’ll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony. ALL THE PLEBEIANS The will, the will! We will hear Caesar’s will. Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it.
It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.
You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;
And, being men, hearing the will of Caesar,
It will inflame you, it will make you mad.
’Tis good you know not that you are his heirs,
For if you should, O what would come of it?
