LAERTES What out of this, my lord? KING CLAUDIUS Laertes, was your father dear to you?
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
A face without a heart? LAERTES Why ask you this? KING CLAUDIUS Not that I think you did not love your father,
But that I know love is begun by time,
And that I see, in passages of proof,
Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake
To show yourself your fatherâ€™s son in deed
More than in words?
