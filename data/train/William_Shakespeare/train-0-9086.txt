Ross Where is Duncan’s body? MACDUFF Carried to Colmekill, The sacred storehouse of his predecessors,
And guardian of their bones. Will you to Scone? No, cousin, I’ll to Fife. Well, I will thither. Well, may you see things well done there. Adieu,
Lest our old robes sit easier than our new. Ross Farewell, father.
