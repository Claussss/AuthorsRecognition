Good-brother, Let me request you off. Our graver business
Frowns at this levity. Gentle lords, letâ€™s part.
You see we have burnt our cheeks. Strong Enobarb
Is weaker than the wine, and mine own tongue
Splits what it speaks. The wild disguise hath almost
Anticked us all. What needs more words? Good night.
Good Antony, your hand.
