Fight and be valiant; conquer where thou com’st. KING EDWARD Now wants there naught but knighthood, which deferred
We leave till thou hast won it in the field. PRINCE OF WALES My gracious father and ye forward peers,
This honour you have done me animates
And cheers my green, yet scarce-appearing, strength
With comfortable, good-presaging signs,
No otherwise than did old Jacob’s words
Whenas he breathed his blessings on his sons.
These hallowed gifts of yours, when I profane
Or use them not to glory of my God
To patronage the fatherless and poor,
Or for the benefit of England’s peace,
Be numb my joints, wax feeble both mine arms,
Wither my heart that, like a sapless tree,
I may remain the map of infamy.
