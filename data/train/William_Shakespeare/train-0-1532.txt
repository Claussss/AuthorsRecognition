Come, go. I will dispatch the horsemen straight.
Within six hours they will be at his aid. Too late comes rescue. He is taâ€™en or slain,
For fly he could not if he would have fled,
And fly would Talbot never, though he might. If he be dead, brave Talbot, then adieu. His fame lives in the world, his shame in you.
