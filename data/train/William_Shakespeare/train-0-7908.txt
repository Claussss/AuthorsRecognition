Well, the matter? I have a brother is condemned to die.
I do beseech you, let it be his fault,
And not my brother. PROVOST (aside) Heaven give thee moving graces! Condemn the fault, and not the actor of it?
Why, every faultâ€™s condemned ere it be done.
Mine were the very cipher of a function,
To fine the faults whose fine stands in record,
And let go by the actor.
