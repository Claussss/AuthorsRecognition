ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE (aside) Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?
Sleeping or waking? Mad or well advised?
Known unto these, and to myself disguised!
Iâ€™ll say as they say, and persever so,
And in this mist at all adventures go. DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Master, shall I be porter at the gate ? Ay, and let none enter, lest I break your pate.
