Good madam, I have done. Yet if my lord will marry—if you will, sir;
No remedy but you will—give me the office
To choose your queen. She shall not be so young
As was your former, but she shall be such
As, walked your first queen’s ghost, it should take joy
To see her in your arms. My true Paulina, We shall not marry till thou bidd’st us.
