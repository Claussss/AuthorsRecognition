Nay, rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence,
Confess who set thee up and plucked thee down,
Call Warwick patron, and be penitent?
And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York. RICHARD OF GLOUCESTER I thought at least he would have said ‘the King’.
Or did he make the jest against his will? Is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gift?
