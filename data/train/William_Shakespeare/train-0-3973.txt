EGEUS It is, my lord. Go bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns. Shout within: wind horns. The lovers all start up  Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past.
Begin these wood-birds but to couple now? Pardon, my lord. The lovers kneel THESEUS I pray you all stand up. The lovers stand (To Demetrius and Lysander) I know you two are rival
enemies.
How comes this gentle concord in the world,
That hatred is so far from jealousy
To sleep by hate, and fear no enmity?
