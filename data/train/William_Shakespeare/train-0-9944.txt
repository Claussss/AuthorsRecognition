He had need mean better than his outward show
Can any way speak in his just commend,
For by his rusty outside he appears
Tâ€™have practised more the whipstock than the lance. SECOND LORD He well may be a stranger, for he comes
Unto an honoured triumph strangely furnished. And on set purpose let his armour rust
Until this day, to scour it in the dust.
