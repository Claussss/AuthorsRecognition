KING HARRY What think you, Captain Fluellen? Is it fit this soldier keep his oath? FLUELLEN He is a craven and a villain else, an’t please your majesty, in my conscience. KING HARRY It may be his enemy is a gentleman of great sort, quite from the answer of his degree. FLUELLEN Though he be as good a gentleman as the devil is, as Lucifer and Beelzebub himself, it is necessary, look your grace, that he keep his vow and his oath. If he be perjured, see you now, his reputation is as arrant a villain and a Jack-sauce as ever his black shoe trod upon God’s ground and his earth, in my conscience, law.
