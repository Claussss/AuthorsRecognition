DUCHESS of YORK Why, what is it, my lord? Give me my boots, I say. Saddle my horse.â€”
Now by mine honour, by my life, my troth,
I will appeach the villain. DUCHESS OF YORK What is the matter? YORK Peace, foolish woman. DUCHESS OF YORK I will not peace. What is the matter, son? Good mother, be content. It is no more
Than my poor life must answer.
