Pursue these fearful creatures o’er the downs,
And on thy well-breathed horse keep with thy
hounds. ‘And when thou hast on foot the purblind hare,
Mark the poor wretch, to overshoot his troubles,
How he outruns the wind, and with what care
He cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles. The many musits through the which he goes
Are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes.
