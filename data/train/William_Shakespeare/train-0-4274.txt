BASSANIO I will not fail you. You look not well, Signor Antonio.
You have too much respect upon the world.
They lose it that do buy it with much care.
Believe me, you are marvellously changed. I hold the world but as the world, Grazianoâ€”
A stage where every man must play a part,
And mine a sad one. GRAZIANO Let me play the fool.
