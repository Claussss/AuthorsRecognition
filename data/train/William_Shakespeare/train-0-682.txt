SLY Are they run away, Sim? That’s well. Then gi’s some more drink, and let them play again. LORD Here, my lord. Sly drinks and then falls asleep D. Sly is carried off between 5.1 and 5.2. Exeunt omnes Who’s within there? Come hither, sirs, my lord’s

And put him in his own apparel again,
And lay him in the place where we did find him
Just underneath the alehouse side below.
But see you wake him not in any case.
