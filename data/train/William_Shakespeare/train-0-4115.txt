KING PHILIP By heaven, lady, you shall have no cause
To curse the fair proceedings of this day.
Have I not pawned to you my majesty? You have beguiled me with a counterfeit 25
Resembling majesty, which being touched and tried
Proves valueless. You are forsworn, forsworn.
You came in arms to spill mine enemies’ blood,
But now in arms you strengthen it with yours.
The grappling vigour and rough frown of war 30
Is cold in amity and painted peace,
And our oppression hath made up this league.
Arm, arm, you heavens, against these perjured Kings!
A widow cries, be husband to me, God!
Let not the hours of this ungodly day 35
Wear out the day in peace, but ere sun set
Set armed discord ’twixt these perjured Kings.
Hear me, O hear me!
