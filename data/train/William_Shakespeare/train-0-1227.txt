Exit Clarence, and Somerset follows RICHARD OF GLOUCESTER Not Iaside
I stay not for the love of Edward, but the crown. KING EDWARD Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick?
Yet am I armed against the worst can happen,
And haste is needful in this despâ€™rate case.
Pembroke and Stafford, you in our behalf
Go levy men and make prepare for war.
They are already, or quickly will be, landed.
Myself in person will straight follow you.
