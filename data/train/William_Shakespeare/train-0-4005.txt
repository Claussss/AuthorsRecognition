Enter Snug as Lion, and Starveling as Moonshine with a lantern, thorn bush, and dog SNUG (as Lion) You, ladies, you whose gentle hearts do fear
The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor,
May now perchance both quake and tremble here
When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.
Then know that I as Snug the joiner am
A lion fell, nor else no lion’s dam.
For if I should as Lion come in strife
Into this place, ’twere pity on my life.
