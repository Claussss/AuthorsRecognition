Enter the King of France and the Duke of
Burgundy, with the Duke of Gloucester Hereâ€™s France and Burgundy, my noble lord. LEAR My lord of Burgundy, We first address towards you, who with a king
Hath rivalled for our daughter: what in the least
Will you require in present dower with her
Or cease your quest of love?
