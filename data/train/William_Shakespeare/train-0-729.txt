Madam, be patient—as I was cause
Your highness came to England, so will I
In England work your grace’s full content. QUEEN MARGARET Beside the haught Protector have we Beaufort
The imperious churchman, Somerset, Buckingham,
And grumbling York; and not the least of these
But can do more in England than the King.
