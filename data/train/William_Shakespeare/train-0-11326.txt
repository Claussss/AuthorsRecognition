Where was this lane? Close by the battle, ditched, and walled with turf;
Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier,
An honest one, I warrant, who deserved
So long a breeding as his white beard came to,
In doing this for ’s country. Athwart the lane
He with two striplings-lads more like to run
The country base than to commit such slaughter;
With faces fit for masks, or rather fairer
Than those for preservation cased, or shame-
Made good the passage, cried to those that fled
‘Our Britain’s harts die flying, not her men.
To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards. Stand,
Or we are Romans, and will give you that
Like beasts which you shun beastly, and may save
But to look back in frown. Stand, stand.’ These three,
Three thousand confident, in act as many-
For three performers are the file when all
The rest do nothing-with this word ‘Stand, stand’,
Accommodated by the place, more charming
With their own nobleness, which could have turned
A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks;
Part shame, part spirit renewed, that some, turned
coward
But by example,-O, a sin in war,
Damned in the first beginnersl-gan to look
The way that they did and to grin like lions
Upon the pikes o‘th’ hunters. Then began
A stop i’th’ chaser, a retire. Anon
A rout, confusion thick; forthwith they fly
Chickens the way which they stooped eagles; slaves,
The strides they victors made; and now our cowards,
Like fragments in hard voyages, became
The life o‘th’ need. Having found the back door open
Of the unguarded hearts, heavens, how they wound!
Some slain before, some dying, some their friends
O’erborne i‘th’ former wave, ten chased by one,
Are now each one the slaughterman of twenty.
Those that would die or ere resist are grown
The mortal bugs o’th’ field.
