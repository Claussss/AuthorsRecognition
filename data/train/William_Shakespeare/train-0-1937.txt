Brackenbury reads BRACKENBURY I am in this commanded to deliver
The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands.
I will not reason what is meant hereby,
Because I will be guiltless of the meaning.
There lies the Duke asleep, and there the keys. He throws down the keys Iâ€™ll to the King and signify to him
That thus I have resigned to you my charge.
