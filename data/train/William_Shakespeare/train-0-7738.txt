MORE O good wife, Honour and jests are both together fled.
The merriest councillor of England’s dead. Who’s that, my lord? MORE Still ‘lord’? The Lord Chancellor, wife. That’s you. Certain, but I have changed my life. Am I not leaner than I was before?
The fat is gone. My title’s only ‘More’.
Contented with one style, I’ll live at rest.
They that have many names are not still best.
I have resigned mine office. Count’st me not wise?
