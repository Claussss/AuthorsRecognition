BERTRAM (to the King) If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly
I’ll love her dearly, ever ever dearly. If it appear not plain and prove untrue,
Deadly divorce step between me and you.—
O my dear mother, do I see you living? Mine eyes smell onions, I shall weep anon.
(To Paroles) Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkerchief.
So, I thank thee. Wait on me home, I’ll make sport
with thee. Let thy curtsies alone, they are scurvy ones.
