â€˜Mine enemy was strong, my poor self weak,
And far the weaker with so strong a fear.
My bloody judge forbade my tongue to speak;
No rightful plea might plead for justice there.
His scarlet lust came evidence to swear That my poor beauty had purloined his eyes;
And when the judge is robbed, the prisoner dies.
