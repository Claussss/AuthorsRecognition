Be cheered, for what misfortune hath impaired you of,
Fortune by my help can repair to you.
My self and country both shall be your friends,
And presently a goodly milk-white steed
And golden spurs I first bestow upon you,
The prizes due your merit, and ordained
For this dayâ€™s enterprise. Your kingly courtesy I thankfully accept.
