So at his bloody view her eyes are fled
Into the deep dark cabins of her head, Where they resign their office and their light
To the disposing of her troubled brain,
Who bids them still consort with ugly night,
And never wound the heart with looks again, Who, like a king perplexed in his throne,
By their suggestion gives a deadly groan,
