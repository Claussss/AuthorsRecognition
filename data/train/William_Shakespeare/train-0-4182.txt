Enter Hubert Let it be so. I do commit his youth
To your direction.—Hubert, what news with you? He takes Hubert aside This is the man should do the bloody deed:
He showed his warrant to a friend of mine. 70
The image of a wicked heinous fault
Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
Does show the mood of a much troubled breast;
And I do fearfully believe ’tis done
What we so feared he had a charge to do. 75
