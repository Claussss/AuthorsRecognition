To your protection I commend me, gods.
From fairies and the tempters of the night
Guard me, beseech ye. She sleeps.
Giacomo comes from the trunk The crickets sing, and man’s o‘er-laboured sense
Repairs itself by rest. Our Tarquin thus
Did softly press the rushes ere he wakened
The chastity he wounded. Cytherea,
How bravely thou becom’st thy bed! Fresh lily,
And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch,
But kiss, one kiss! Rubies unparagoned,
How dearly they do‘t! ’Tis her breathing that
Perfumes the chamber thus. The flame o‘th’ taper
Bows toward her, and would underpeep her lids,
To see th’enclosed lights, now canopied
Under these windows, white and azure-laced
With blue of heaven’s own tinct. But my design-
To note the chamber. I will write all down.
