Hear me, good madam: Your loss is as yourself, great, and you bear it
As answering to the weight. Would I might never
Oâ€™ertake pursued success but I do feel,
By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites
My very heart at root. I thank you, sir. Know you what Caesar means to do with me? I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.
