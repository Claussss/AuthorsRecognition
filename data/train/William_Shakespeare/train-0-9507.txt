Exit Decretas Art thou there, Diomed? Draw thy sword, and give me
Sufficing strokes for death. Most absolute lord, My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee. When did she send thee? Now, my lord. ANTONY Where is she? Locked in her monument. She had a prophesying fear
Of what hath come to pass; for when she saw—
Which never shall be found—you did suspect
She had disposed with Caesar, and that your rage
Would not be purged, she sent word she was dead;
But fearing since how it might work, hath sent
Me to proclaim the truth; and I am come,
I dread, too late.
