To prove thou hast a true-divining heart,
Aaron and thou look down into this den,
And see a fearful sight of blood and death. Aaron is gone, and my compassionate heart
Will not permit mine eyes once to behold
The thing whereat it trembles by surmise.
O, tell me who it is, for neâ€™er till now
Was I a child to fear I know not what.
