Indeed I have been merrier. ARTHURMercy on me! Methinks nobody should be sad but I.
Yet I remember, when I was in France,
Young gentlemen would be as sad as night 15
Only for wantonness. By my christendom,
So I were out of prison and kept sheep,
I should be as merry as the day is long;
And so I would be here, but that I doubt
My uncle practises more harm to me. 20
He is afraid of me, and I of him.
Is it my fault that I was Geoffrey’s son?
No, indeed is’t not, and I would to God
I were your son, so you would love me, Hubert.
