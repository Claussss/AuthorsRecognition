Prince Harry reads the letter POINS Marry, the immortal part needs a physician, but that moves not him. Though that be sick, it dies not. PRINCE HARRY I do allow this wen to be as familiar with me as my dog; and he holds his place, for look you how he writes. He gives Poins the letter POINS ‘John Falstaff, knight’.—Every man must know that, as oft as he has occasion to name himself; even like those that are kin to the King, for they never prick their finger but they say ‘There’s some of the King’s blood spilt.’ ‘How comes that?’ says he that takes upon him not to conceive. The answer is as ready as a borrower’s cap: ‘I am the King’s poor cousin, sir.’
