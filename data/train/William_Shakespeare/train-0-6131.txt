Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you. Do so, good Messala. MESSALA How died my master, Strato? I held the sword, and he did run on it. Octavius, then take him to follow thee,
That did the latest service to my master. This was the noblest Roman of them all.
All the conspirators save only he
Did that they did in envy of great Caesar.
He only in a general honest thought
And common good to all made one of them.
His life was gentle, and the elements
So mixed in him that nature might stand up
And say to all the world ‘This was a man’.
