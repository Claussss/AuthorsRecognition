LODOVICO (to Iago) What, not to pray? GRAZIANO (to Iago) Torments will ope your lips. OTHELLO Well, thou dost best. Sir, you shall understand what hath befallâ€™n,

Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo,
And here another. The one of them imports
The death of Cassio, to be undertook
By Roderigo.
