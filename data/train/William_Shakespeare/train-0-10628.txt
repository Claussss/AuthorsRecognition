Shepherdess, A fair one are you. Well you fit our ages
With flowers of winter. Sir, the year growing ancient, Not yet on summer’s death, nor on the birth
Of trembling winter, the fairest flowers o’th’ season
Are our carnations and streaked gillyvors,
Which some call nature’s bastards. Of that kind
Our rustic garden’s barren, and I care not
To get slips of them.
