So well that what you bid me undertake,
Though that my death were adjunct to my act,
By heaven, I would do it. KING JOHN Do not I know thou wouldst? Good Hubert, Hubert, Hubert, throw thine eye
On yon young boy. I’ll tell thee what, my friend,
He is a very serpent in my way,
And wheresoe’er this foot of mine doth tread,
He lies before me. Dost thou understand me?
Thou art his keeper.
