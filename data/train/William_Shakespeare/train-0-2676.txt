PRINCE OF WALES I have assembled, my dear lord and father,
The choicest buds of all our English blood
For our affairs to France, and here we come
To take direction from your majesty. KING EDWARD (aside) Still do I see in him delineate
His mother’s visage. Those his eyes are hers,
Who looking wistly on me make me blush.
For faults against themselves give evidence;
Lust is a fire, and men, like lanterns, show
Light lust within themselves, even through themselves.
Away, loose silks o’er wavering vanity!
Shall the large limit of fair Brittany
By me be overthrown, and shall I not
Master this little mansion of myself?
Give me an armour of eternal steel:
I go to conquer kings; and shall I not then
Subdue myself and be my enemy’s friend?
It must not be. (To the Prince) Come, boy! Forward!
