Enter Richard Plantagenet My lord, your loving nephew now is come. Richard Plantagenet, my friend, is he come? RICHARD PLANTAGENET Ay, noble uncle, thus ignobly used:
Your nephew, late despised Richard, comes. MORTIMER (to Keepers) Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck
And in his bosom spend my latter gasp.
O tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks,
That I may kindly give one fainting kiss.
