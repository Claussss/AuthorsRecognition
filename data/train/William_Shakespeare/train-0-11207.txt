Leonatus Posthumus.’ O for a horse with wings! Hear‘st thou, Pisanio?
He is at Milford Haven. Read, and tell me
How far ’tis thither. If one of mean affairs
May plod it in a week, why may not I
Glide thither in a day? Then, true Pisanio,
Who long‘st like me to see thy lord, who long’st—
O let me bate—but not like me—yet long‘st
But in a fainter kind—O, not like me,
For mine’s beyond beyond; say, and speak thick—
Love’s counsellor should fill the bores of hearing,
To th’ smothering of the sense—how far it is
To this same bless
Tell me how Wales was made so happy as
T’inherit such a haven. But first of all,
How we may steal from hence; and for the gap
That we shall make in time from our hence-going
Till our return, to excuse; but first, how get hence.
Why should excuse be born or ere begot?
We’ll talk of that hereafter. Prithee speak,
How many score of miles may we well ride
’Twixt hour and hour?
