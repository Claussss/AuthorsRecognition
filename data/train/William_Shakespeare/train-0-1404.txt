Well, let them practise and converse with spirits.
God is our fortress, in whose conquering name
Let us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarks. Ascend, brave Talbot. We will follow thee. Not all together. Better far, I guess,
That we do make our entrance several waysâ€”
That, if it chance the one of us do fail,
The other yet may rise against their force.
