DAUPHIN My most redoubted father, It is most meet we arm us ‘gainst the foe,
For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom—
Though war, nor no known quarrel, were in
question—
But that defences, musters, preparations
Should be maintained, assembled, and collected
As were a war in expectation.
Therefore, I say, ’tis meet we all go forth
To view the sick and feeble parts of France.
And let us do it with no show of fear,
No, with no more than if we heard that England
Were busied with a Whitsun morris dance.
For, my good liege, she is so idly kinged,
Her sceptre so fantastically borne
By a vain, giddy, shallow, humorous youth,
That fear attends her not.
