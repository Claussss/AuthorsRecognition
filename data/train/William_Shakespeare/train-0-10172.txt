MARTIUS (to the Messenger) How far off lie these armies? MESSENGER Within this mile and half. Then shall we hear their â€™larum, and they ours.
Now Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work,
That we with smoking swords may march from hence
To help our fielded friends.
(To the trumpeter) Come, blow thy blast.
