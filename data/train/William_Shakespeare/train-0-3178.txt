MOTE Offered by a child to an old man, which is ‘wit-old’. HOLOFERNES What is the figure? What is the figure? MOTE Horns. HOLOFERNES Thou disputes like an infant. Go whip thy gig. MOTE Lend me your horn to make one, and I will whip about your infamy circum circa—a gig of a cuckold’s horn. CUSTARD An I had but one penny in the world, thou shouldst have it to buy gingerbread. (Giving money) Hold, there is the very remuneration I had of thy master, thou halfpenny purse of wit, thou pigeon-egg of discretion. O, an the heavens were so pleased that thou wert but my bastard, what a joyful father wouldst thou make me! Go to, thou hast it ad dunghill, at the fingers’ ends, as they say.
