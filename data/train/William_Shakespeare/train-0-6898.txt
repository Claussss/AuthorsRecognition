I am not weary, and ’tis long to night.
I pray you let us satisfy our eyes
With the memorials and the things of fame
That do renown this city. Would you’d pardon me.
I do not without danger walk these streets.
Once in a sea-fight ‘gainst the Count his galleys
I did some service, of such note indeed
That were I ta’en here it would scarce be answered.
