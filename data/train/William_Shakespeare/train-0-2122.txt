DUCHESS OF YORK rising I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him;
I had a Rutland too, thou holpst to kill him. QUEEN MARGARET Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard killed him.
From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death:
That dog that had his teeth before his eyes,
To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood;
That foul defacer of God’s handiwork,
That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls;
That excellent grand tyrant of the earth
Thy womb let loose to chase us to our graves.
O upright, just, and true-disposing God,
How do I thank thee that this charnel cur
Preys on the issue of his mother’s body,
And makes her pewfellow with others’ moan.
