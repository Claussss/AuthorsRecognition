CARDINAL BEAUFORT It serves you well, my lord, to say so much. I say no more than truth, so help me God. In your Protectorship you did devise
Strange tortures for offenders, never heard of,
That England was defamed by tyranny. Why, ’tis well known that whiles I was Protector
Pity was all the fault that was in me,
For I should melt at an offender’s tears,
And lowly words were ransom for their fault.
Unless it were a bloody murderer,
Or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers,
I never gave them condign punishment.
Murder, indeed—that bloody sin—I tortured
Above the felon or what trespass else.
