TIMON Go to. Perchance some single vantages you took,
When my indisposition put you back,
And that unaptness made your minister
Thus to excuse yourself. FLAVIUS O my good lord, At many times I brought in my accounts,
Laid them before you; you would throw them off
And say you summed them in mine honesty.
When for some trifling present you have bid me
Return so much, I have shook my head and wept,
Yea, ‘gainst th’authority of manners prayed you
To hold your hand more close. I did endure
Not seldom nor no slight checks when I have
Prompted you in the ebb of your estate
And your great flow of debts. My lov
Though you hear now too late, yet now’s a time—
The greatest of your having lacks a half
To pay your present debts.
