SATURNINUS (to an attendant) Go, take him away, and hang him presently. CLOWN How much money must I have? TAMORA Come, sirrah, you must be hanged. CLOWN Hanged, bywith attendant Despiteful and intolerable wrongs!
Shall I endure this monstrous villainy?
I know from whence this same device proceeds.
May this be borne?-As if his traitorous sons,
That died by law for murder of our brother,
Have by my means been butchered wrongfully!
Go, drag the villain hither by the hair.
Nor age nor honour shall shape privilege.
For this proud mock I’ll be thy slaughterman,
Sly frantic wretch, that holp’st to make me great
In hope thyself should govern Rome and me.
