From France to England. Never such a power
For any foreign preparation
Was levied in the body of a land.
The copy of your speed is learned by them,
For when you should be told they do prepare,
The tidings comes that they are all arrived. O, where hath our intelligence been drunk?
Where hath it slept? Where is my motherâ€™s ear,
That such an army could be drawn in France,
And she not hear of it?
