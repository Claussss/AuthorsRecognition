KING RICHARD (aside) I will converse with iron-witted fools
And unrespective boys. None are for me
That look into me with considerate eyes.
High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect.—
Boy. PAGE My lord? KING RICHARD Know’st thou not any whom corrupting gold
Will tempt unto a close exploit of death?
