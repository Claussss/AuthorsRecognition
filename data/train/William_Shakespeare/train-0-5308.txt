Not so much noise, my lords! Sweet prince, speak low.
The King your father is disposed to sleep. Let us withdraw into the other room. Will’t please your grace to go along with us? PRINCE HARRY No, I will sit and watch here by the King. Exeunt all but the King and Prince Harry Why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow,
Being so troublesome a bedfellow?
O polished perturbation, golden care,
That keep‘st the ports of slumber open wide
To many a watchful night!—Sleep with it now;
Yet not so sound, and half so deeply sweet,
As he whose brow with homely biggen bound
Snores out the watch of night. O majesty,
When thou dost pinch thy bearer, thou dost sit
Like a rich armour worn in heat of day,
That scald’st with safety.—By his gates of breath
There lies a downy feather which stirs not.
Did he suspire, that light and weightless down
Perforce must move.—My gracious lord, my father!—
This sleep is sound indeed. This is a sleep
That from this golden rigol hath divorced
So many English kings.—Thy due from me
Is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood,
Which nature, love, and filial tenderness
Shall, O dear father, pay thee plenteously.
My due from thee is this imperial crown,
Which, as immediate from thy place and blood,
Derives itself to me.
