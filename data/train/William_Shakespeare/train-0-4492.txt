NERISSA (to Graziano) Nor I in yours Till I again see mine. BASSANIO Sweet Portia, If you did know to whom I gave the ring,
If you did know for whom I gave the ring,
And would conceive for what I gave the ring,
And how unwillingly I left the ring
When naught would be accepted but the ring,
You would abate the strength of your displeasure.
