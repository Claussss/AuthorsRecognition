A horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse! Withdraw, my lord. Iâ€™ll help you to a horse. KING RICHARD Slave, I have set my life upon a cast,
And I will stand the hazard of the die.
I think there be six Richmonds in the field.
Five have I slain today, instead of him.
A horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse!
