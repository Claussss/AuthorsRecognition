NORTHUMBERLAND Before the game is afoot thou still lett’st slip. Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot—
And then the power of Scotland and of York
To join with Mortimer, ha? WORCESTER And so they shall. In faith, it is exceedingly well aimed. And ’tis no little reason bids us speed
To save our heads by raising of a head;
For, bear ourselves as even as we can,
The King will always think him in our debt,
And think we think ourselves unsatisfied
Till he hath found a time to pay us home.
And see already how he doth begin
To make us strangers to his looks of love.
