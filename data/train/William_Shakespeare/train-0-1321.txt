Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind;
The thief doth fear each bush an officer. The bird that hath been lim
With trembling wings misdoubteth every bush.
And I, the hapless male to one sweet bird,
Have now the fatal object in my eye
Where my poor young was limed, was caught and
killed. RICHARD OF GLOUCESTER
