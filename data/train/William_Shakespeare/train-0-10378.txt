AUFIDIUS O Martius, Martius! Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter
Should from yon cloud speak divine things
And say “Tis true’, I’d not believe them more
Than thee, all-noble Martius. Let me twine
Mine arms about that body whereagainst
My grained ash an hundred times hath broke,
And scarred the moon with splinters.
