POLONIUSGive oâ€™er the play. KING CLAUDIUS Give me some light. Away.  Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio Why, let the stricken deer go weep,
The hart ungall
For some must watch, while some must sleep,
So runs the world away.
Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers, if the rest
of my fortunes turn Turk with me, with two Proven
roses on my razed shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry
of players, sir?
