KING EDWARD Away with mourning, Philip! Wipe thine eyes!
Sound trumpets! Welcome in Plantagenet! Enter Edward Prince of Wales with Jean King of France and Prince Philippe as his prisoners. Also enter Lord Audley  As things long lost when they are found again,
So doth my son rejoice his fatherâ€™s heart,
For whom, even now, my soul was much perplexed.
