Stay, lords and gentlemen, and pluck no more
Till you conclude that he upon whose side
The fewest roses from the tree are cropped
Shall yield the other in the right opinion. Good Master Vernon, it is well objected.
If I have fewest, I subscribe in silence. RICHARD PLANTAGENET And I. Then for the truth and plainness of the case
I pluck this pale and maiden blossom here,
Giving my verdict on the white roseâ€™ side.
