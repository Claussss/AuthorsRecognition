Marshal, demand of yonder champion
The cause of his arrival here in arms.
Ask him his name, and orderly proceed
To swear him in the justice of his cause. LORD MARSHAL (to Mowbray) In God’s name and the King‘s, say who thou art,
And why thou com’st thus knightly clad in arms,
Against what man thou com’st, and what thy
quarrel.
Speak truly on thy knighthood and thy oath,
As so defend thee heaven and thy valour!
