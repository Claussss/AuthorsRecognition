ROSALIND Thou speak’st wiser than thou art ware of. TOUCHSTONE Nay, I shall ne’er be ware of mine own wit till I break my shins against it. Jove, Jove, this shepherd’s passion
Is much upon my fashion. TOUCHSTONE And mine, but it grows something stale with me. I pray you, one of you question yon man
If he for gold will give us any food.
I faint almost to death.
