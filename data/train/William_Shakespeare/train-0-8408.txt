OTHELLOWho’s there? EMILIA (within) O, good my lord, I would speak a word with you. OTHELLO (calling) Yes.—‘Tis Emilia. (Calling) By and by!—She’s dead.
’Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio’s death.
The noise was high. Ha! No more moving.
Still as the grave. Shall she come in? Were’t good?
I think she stirs again. No. What’s best to do?
If she come in, she’ll sure speak to my wife.
My wife, my wife! What wife? I ha’ no wife.
O insupportable, O heavy hour!
Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse
Of sun and moon, and that th’affrighted globe
Should yawn at alteration.
