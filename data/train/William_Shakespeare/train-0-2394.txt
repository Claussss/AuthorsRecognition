Let fair humanity abhor the deed
That spots and stains love’s modest snow-white weed. ‘O shame to knighthood and to shining arms!
O foul dishonour to my household’s grave!
O impious act including all foul harms!
A martial man to be soft fancy’s slave!
True valour still a true respect should have; Then my digression is so vile, so base,
That it will live engraven in my face.
