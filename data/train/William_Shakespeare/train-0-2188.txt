Enter the Ghost of young Prince Edward above GHOST OF PRINCE EDWARD (to Richard) Let me sit heavy on thy soul tomorrow,
Prince Edward, son to Henry the Sixth.
Think how thou stabbedst me in my prime of youth
At Tewkesbury. Despair, therefore, and die.
(To Richmond) Be cheerful, Richmond, for the wronged
souls
Of butchered princes fight in thy behalf.
King Henryâ€™s issue, Richmond, comforts thee. Exit
