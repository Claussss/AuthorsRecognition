PRINCE OF WALES Look not for cross invectives at our hands,
Or railing execrations of despite.
Let creeping serpents hid in hollow banks
Sting with their tongues; we have remorseless swords,
And they shall plead for us and our affairs.
Yet thus much briefly, by my fatherâ€™s leave,
As all the immodest poison of thy throat
Is scandalous and most notorious lies,
And our pretended quarrel is truly just,
So end the battle when we meet today:
May either of us prosper and prevail
Or, luckless cursed, receive eternal shame.
