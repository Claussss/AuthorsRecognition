Yes, Caliban her son. Dull thing, I say so: he, that Caliban
Whom now I keep in service. Thou best knowâ€™st
What torment I did find thee in. Thy groans
Did make wolves howl, and penetrate the breasts
Of ever-angry bears; it was a torment
To lay upon the damned, which Sycorax
Could not again undo. It was mine art,
When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape
The pine and let thee out.
