SECOND GENTLEMAN ’Tis all my business. At our last encounter
The Duke of Buckingham came from his trial. FIRST GENTLEMAN ’Tis very true. But that time offered sorrow,
This, general joy. SECOND GENTLEMAN ’Tis well. The citizens, I am sure, have shown at full their royal minds—
As, let ’em have their rights, they are ever forward—
In celebration of this day with shows,
Pageants, and sights of honour.
