ARIEL (to Gonzalo) My master through his art foresees the danger
That you his friend are in—and sends me forth,
For else his project dies, to keep them living. He sings in Gonzalo’s ear While you here do snoring lie,
Open-eyed conspiracy
His time doth take.
If of life you keep a care,
Shake off slumber, and beware.
Awake, awake!
ANTONIO (to Sebastian)
