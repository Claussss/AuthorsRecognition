Sith in his prime death doth my love destroy,
They that love best their loves shall not enjoy.â€™ By this, the boy that by her side lay killed
Was melted like a vapour from her sight,
And in his blood that on the ground lay spilled
A purple flower sprung up, chequered with white, Resembling well his pale cheeks, and the blood
Which in round drops upon their whiteness stood.
