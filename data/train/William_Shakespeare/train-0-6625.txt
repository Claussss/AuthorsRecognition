Where is my father? KING CLAUDIUS QUEEN GERTRUDE (to Laertes) But not by him. KING CLAUDIUS Let him demand his fill. How came he dead? I’ll not be juggled with.
To hell, allegiance! Vows to the blackest devil!
Conscience and grace to the profoundest pit!
I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
That both the worlds I give to negligence,
Let come what comes. Only I’ll be revenged
Most throughly for my father.
