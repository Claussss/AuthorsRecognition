QUEEN KATHERINE My lord, my lord— I am a simple woman, much too weak
T‘oppose your cunning. You’re meek and humblemouthed;
 You sign your place and calling, in full seeming,
With meekness and humility—but your heart
Is crammed with arrogancy, spleen, and pride.
You have by fortune and his highness’ favours
Gone slightly o’er low steps, and now are mounted
Where powers are your retainers, and your words,
Domestics to you, serve your will as’t please
Yourself pronounce their office. I must tell you,
You tender more your person’s honour than
Your high profession spiritual, that again
I do refuse you for my judge, and here,
Before you all, appeal unto the Pope,
To bring my whole cause ’fore his holiness,
And to be judged by him.
