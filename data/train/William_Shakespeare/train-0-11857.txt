My lord, I love you, And durst commend a secret to your ear
Much weightier than this work. The Queen’s in labour—
They say in great extremity—and feared
She’ll with the labour end. The fruit she goes with I pray for heartily, that it may find
Good time, and live. But, for the stock, Sir Thomas,
I wish it grubbed up now.
