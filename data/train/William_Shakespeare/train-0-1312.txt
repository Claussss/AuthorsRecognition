RICHARD OF GLOUCESTER For God’s sake take away this captive scold. PRINCE EDWARD Nay, take away this scolding crookback rather. KING EDWARD Peace, wilful boy, or I will charm your tongue. GEORGE OF CLARENCE (to Prince Edward) Untutored lad, thou art too malapert. PRINCE EDWARD I know my duty—you are all undutiful.
Lascivious Edward, and thou, perjured George,
And thou, misshapen Dick—I tell ye all
I am your better, traitors as ye are,
And thou usurp’st my father’s right and mine.
