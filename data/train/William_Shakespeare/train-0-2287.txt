But now I lived, and life was death’s annoy;
But now I died, and death was lively joy. ‘O, thou didst kill me; kill me once again!
Thy eyes’ shrewd tutor, that hard heart of thine,
Hath taught them scornful tricks, and such disdain
That they have murdered this poor heart of mine, And these mine eyes, true leaders to their queen,
But for thy piteous lips no more had seen.
