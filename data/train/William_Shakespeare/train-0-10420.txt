Only make trial what your love can do
For Rome towards Martius. Well, and say that Martius return me,
As Cominius is returned, unheard—what then?
But as a discontented friend, grief-shot
With his unkindness? Say’t be so? Yet your good will Must have that thanks from Rome after the measure
As you intended well.
