NORTHUMBERLAND Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief,
And, by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it. WESTMORLAND (to York) Plantagenet, of thee, and these thy sons,
Thy kinsmen, and thy friends, I’ll have more lives
Than drops of blood were in my father’s veins. CLIFFORD (to Warwick) Urge it no more, lest that, instead of words,
I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger
As shall revenge his death before I stir.
