JULIA But shall I hear him speak? HOST Ay, that you shall. JULIA That will be music. HOST Hark, hark. JULIA Is he among these? HOST Ay. But peace, let’s hear ’em. Who is Silvia? What is she,
That all our swains commend her?
Holy, fair, and wise is she.
The heaven such grace did lend her
That she might admired be.
