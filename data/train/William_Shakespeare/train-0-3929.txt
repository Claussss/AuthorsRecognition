You do advance your cunning more and more,
When truth kills truth—O devilish holy fray!
These vows are Hermia’s. Will you give her o’er?
Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh.
Your vows to her and me put in two scales
Will even weigh, and both as light as tales. I had no judgement when to her I swore.
