But in this kind, wanting your fatherâ€™s voice,
The other must be held the worthier. I would my father looked but with my eyes. Rather your eyes must with his judgement look. I do entreat your grace to pardon me.
I know not by what power I am made bold,
Nor how it may concern my modesty
In such a presence here to plead my thoughts,
But I beseech your grace that I may know
The worst that may befall me in this case
If I refuse to wed Demetrius.
