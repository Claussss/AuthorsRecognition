He sets down the heads and hand. Exit Now let hot Etna cool in Sicily,
And be my heart an ever-burning hell.
These miseries are more than may be borne.
To weep with them that weep doth ease some deal,
But sorrow flouted at is double death. Ah, that this sight should make so deep a wound
And yet detested life not shrink thereatâ€”
That ever death should let life bear his name
Where life hath no more interest but to breathe!
