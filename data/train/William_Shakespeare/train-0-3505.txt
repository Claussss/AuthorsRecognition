HARRY PERCY My lord, some two days since, I saw the Prince,
And told him of these triumphs held at Oxford. KING HENRY And what said the gallant? HARRY PERCY His answer was he would unto the stews,
And from the commonâ€™st creature pluck a glove,
And wear it as a favour, and with that
He would unhorse the lustiest challenger.
