KING DUNCAN Dismayed not this our captains, Macbeth and
Banquo? Yes, as sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion!
If I say sooth I must report they were
As cannons overcharged with double cracks,
So they doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe.
Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds
Or memorize another Golgotha,
I cannot tellâ€”
But I am faint. My gashes cry for help.
