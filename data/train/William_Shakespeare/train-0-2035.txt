Exeunt Stanley and Catesby Well met, Hastings. How goes the world with thee? The better that your lordship please to ask. LORD HASTINGS I tell thee, man, ‘tis better with me now
Than when I met thee last, where now we meet.
Then was I going prisoner to the Tower,
By the suggestion of the Queen’s allies;
But now, I tell thee—keep it to thyself—
This day those enemies are put to death,
And I in better state than e’er I was.
