‘Here I give to understand,
If e’er this coffin drives a-land,
I, King Pericles, have lost
This queen worth all our mundane cost.
Who finds her, give her burying;
She was the daughter of a king.
Besides this treasure for a fee,
The gods requite his charity.’ If thou liv’st, Pericles, thou hast a heart
That even cracks for woe. This chanced tonight.
