No wonder, sir, But certainly a maid. My language! Heavens! I am the best of them that speak this speech,
Were I but where â€™tis spoken. How, the best? What wert thou if the King of Naples heard thee? A single thing, as I am now that wonders
To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me,
And that he does I weep. Myself am Naples,
Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld
The King my father wrecked.
