My Collatine would else have come to me
When Tarquin did, but he was stayed by thee. â€˜Guilty thou art of murder and of theft,
Guilty of perjury and subornation,
Guilty of treason, forgery, and shift,
Guilty of incest, that abomination:
An accessory by thine inclination To all sins past and all that are to come
From the creation to the general doom.
