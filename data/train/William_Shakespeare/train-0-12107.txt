Enter a Gentlemanl How now, sir? From the noble Duke your brother,
 Madam, I bring you news. The knights are come. To end the quarrel? Would I might end first!
 What sins have I committed, chaste Diana,
That my unspotted youth must now be soiled
With blood of princes, and my chastity
Be made the altar where the lives of lovers—
Two greater and two better never yet
Made mothers joy—must be the sacrifice
To my unhappy beauty?
