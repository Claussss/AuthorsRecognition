QUEEN MARGARET (aside) Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave this world,
Thou cacodemon; there thy kingdom is. My lord of Gloucester, in those busy days
Which here you urge to prove us enemies,
We followed then our lord, our sovereign king.
So should we you, if you should be our king. RICHARD GLOUCESTER
