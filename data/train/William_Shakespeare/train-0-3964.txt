I have a venturous fairy that shall seek
The squirrelâ€™s hoard, and fetch thee off new nuts. Bottom I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas. But I pray you, let none of your people stir me. I have an exposition of sleep come upon me. Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.
Fairies, be gone, and be all ways away.
