ENOBARBUS (aside) To be sure of that I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky
That we must leave thee to thy sinking, for
Thy dearest quit thee. Shall I say to Caesar What you require of him?â€”For he partly begs
To be desired to give. It much would please him
That of his fortunes you should make a staff
To lean upon. But it would warm his spirits
To hear from me you had left Antony,
And put your self under his shroud,
The universal landlord.
