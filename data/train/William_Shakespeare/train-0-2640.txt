LODOWICK (reading) ‘More fair and chaste than is the queen of shades’— KING EDWARD (staying him) That line hath two faults, gross and palpable.
Compar’st thou her to the pale queen of night,
Who, being set in dark, seems therefore light?
What is she when the sun lifts up his head
But like a fading taper, dim and dead?
My love shall brave the eye of heaven at noon,
And, being unmasked, outshine the golden sun!
