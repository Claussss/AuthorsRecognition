TOUCHSTONE I’ll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners, and suppers, and sleeping-hours excepted. It is the right butter-women’s rank to market. ROSALIND Out, fool. TOUCHSTONE For a taste: If a hart do lack a hind,
Let him seek out Rosalind.
If the cat will after kind,
So, be sure, will Rosalind.
Wintered garments must be lined,
So must slender Rosalind.
They that reap must sheaf and bind,
Then to cart with Rosalind.
‘Sweetest nut hath sourest rind’,
Such a nut is Rosalind.
He that sweetest rose will find
Must find love’s prick, and Rosalind.
