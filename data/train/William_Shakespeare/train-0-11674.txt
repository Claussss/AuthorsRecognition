‘Tis time to give ’em physic, their diseases
Are grown so catching. LORD CHAMBERLAIN What a loss our ladies Will have of these trim vanities! There will be woe indeed, lords. The sly whoresons
Have got a speeding trick to lay down ladies.
A French song and a fiddle has no fellow. The devil fiddle ’em! I am glad they are going,
For sure there’s no converting of ’em. Now
An honest country lord, as I am, beaten
A long time out of play, may bring his plainsong
And have an hour of hearing, and, by’r Lady,
Held current music, too.
