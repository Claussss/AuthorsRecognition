O, let me pray before I take my death.
Kneeling Such pity as my rapier’s point affords. I never did thee harm—why wilt thou slay me? Thy father hath. RUTLAND But ’twas ere I was born. Thou hast one son—for his sake pity me,
Lest in revenge thereof, sith God is just,
He be as miserably slain as I.
Ah, let me live in prison all my days,
And when I give occasion of offence,
Then let me die, for now thou hast no cause.
