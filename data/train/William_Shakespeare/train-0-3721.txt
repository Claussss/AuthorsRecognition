O Lord, I could have stayed here all the night
To hear good counsel! O, what learning is!
My lord, Iâ€™ll tell my lady you will come. Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide. Nurse offers to go in, and turns again NURSE (giving the ring) Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir.
Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
