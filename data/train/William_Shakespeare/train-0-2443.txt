From vassal actors can be wiped away;
Then kings’ misdeeds cannot be hid in clay. ’This deed will make thee only loved for fear,
But happy monarchs still are feared for love.
With foul offenders thou perforce must bear
When they in thee the like offences prove.
If but for fear of this, thy will remove;
