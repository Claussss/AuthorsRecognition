GLOUCESTER Alack, alack the day! LEAR removing his crown of weeds When we are born, we cry that we are come
To this great stage of fools. This’ a good block.
It were a delicate stratagem to shoe 180
A troop of horse with felt. I’ll put’t in proof,
And when I have stol’n upon these son-in-laws,
Then kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!
