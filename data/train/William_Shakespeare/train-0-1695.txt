AARON (aside) Now will I fetch the King to find them here,
That he thereby may have a likely guess
How these were they that made away his brother. Why dost not comfort me and help me out
From this unhallowed and bloodstained hole? I am surprised with an uncouth fear.
A chilling sweat oâ€™erruns my trembling joints;
My heart suspects more than mine eye can see.
