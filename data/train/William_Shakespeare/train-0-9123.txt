Exit Ghost
Why so, being gone, I am a man again. Pray you sit still. LADY MACBETH You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting
With most admired disorder. Can such things be And overcome us like a summerâ€™s cloud,
Without our special wonder? You make me strange
Even to the disposition that I owe,
When now I think you can behold such sights
And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks
When mine is blanched with fear.
