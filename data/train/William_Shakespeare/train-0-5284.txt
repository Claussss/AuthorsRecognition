Alarum. Excursions. Enter Sir John Falstaff and Coleville 
SIR JOHN What’s your name, sir, of what condition are you, and of what place, I pray? COLEVILLE I am a knight, sir, and my name is Coleville of the Dale. SIR JOHN Well then, Coleville is your name, a knight is your degree, and your place the Dale. Coleville shall be still your name, a traitor your degree, and the dungeon your place—a place deep enough, so shall you be still Coleville of the Dale.
