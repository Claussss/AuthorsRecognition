Flourish. Exeunt
Epilogue Enter Epilogue I would now ask ye how ye like the play,
But, as it is with schoolboys, cannot say.
I am cruel fearful. Pray yet stay awhile,
And let me look upon ye. No man smile?
Then it goes hard, I see. He that has
Loved a young handsome wench, then, show his
face—
’Tis strange if none be here—and, if he will,
Against his conscience let him hiss and kill
Our market. ’Tis in vain, I see, to stay ye.
Have at the worst can come, then! Now, what say ye?
And yet mistake me not—I am not bold—
We have no such cause. If the tale we have totd—
For ’tis no other—any way content ye,
For to that honest purpose it was meant ye,
We have our end; and ye shall have ere long,
I dare say, many a better to prolong
Your old loves to us. We and all our might
Rest at your service. Gentlemen, good night.
