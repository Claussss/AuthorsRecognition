And ours with thine, befall what fortune will. Good uncle, take you in this barbarous Moor,
This ravenous tiger, this accursed devil.
Let him receive no sust’nance, fetter him
Till he be brought unto the Empress’ face
For testimony of her foul proceedings,
And see the ambush of our friends be strong.
I fear the Emperor means no good to us.
