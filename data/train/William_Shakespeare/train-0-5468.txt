DON PEDRO Come, Balthasar, weâ€™ll hear that song again. O good my lord, tax not so bad a voice
To slander music any more than once. It is the witness still of excellency
To put a strange face on his own perfection.
I pray thee sing, and let me woo no more. Because you talk of wooing I will sing,
Since many a wooer doth commence his suit
To her he thinks not worthy, yet he woos,
Yet will he swear he loves.
