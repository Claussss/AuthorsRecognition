HAMLET Words, words, words. POLONIUS What is the matter, my lord? HAMLET Between who? POLONIUS I mean the matter you read, my lord. HAMLET Slanders, sir; for the satirical slave says here that old men have grey beards, that their faces are wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber, or plum-tree gum, and that they have a plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams. All which, sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir, should be old as I amâ€”if, like a crab, you could go backward.
