KING CLAUDIUS How is it that the clouds still hang on you? Not so, my lord, I am too much i’th’ sun. QUEEN GERTRUDE Good Hamlet, cast thy nightly colour off,
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
Do not for ever with thy vail
Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
Thou know‘st ’tis common—all that lives must die,
Passing through nature to eternity.
