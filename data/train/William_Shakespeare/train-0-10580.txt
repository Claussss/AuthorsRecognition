You knew of his departure, as you know What you have underta’en to do in’s absence. HERMIONE Sir, You speak a language that I understand not.
My life stands in the level of your dreams,
Which I’ll lay down. Your actions are my ‘dreams’. You had a bastard by Polixenes,
And I but dreamed it. As you were past all shame—
Those of your fact are so—so past all truth;
Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as
Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,
No father owning it—which is indeed
More criminal in thee than it—so thou
Shalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage
Look for no less than death.
