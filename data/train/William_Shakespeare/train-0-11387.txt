Guiderius and Arviragus rise O Innogen,
Thou hast lost by this a kingdom. No, my lord, I have got two worlds by’t. O my gentle brothers,
Have we thus met? O, never say hereafter
But I am truest speaker. You called me brother
When I was but your sister; I you brothers
When ye were so indeed. Did you e’er meet?
