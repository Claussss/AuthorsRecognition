CASSIO I humbly thank you for’t. I never knew a Florentine more kind and honest. Enter Emilia Good morrow, good lieutenant. I am sorry
For your displeasure, but all will sure be well.
The general and his wife are talking of it,
And she speaks for you stoutly. The Moor replies
That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus,
And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom
He might not but refuse you. But he protests he loves
you,
And needs no other suitor but his likings
To take the saf’st occasion by the front
To bring you in again.
