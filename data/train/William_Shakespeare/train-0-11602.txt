But O, how oddly will it sound, that I
Must ask my child forgiveness! There, sir, stop. Let us not burden our remembrance with
A heaviness thatâ€™s gone. I have inly wept, Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you gods,
And on this couple drop a blessed crown,
For it is you that have chalked forth the way
Which brought us hither.
