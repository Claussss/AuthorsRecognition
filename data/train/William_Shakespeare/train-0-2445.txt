Thou back‘st reproach against long-living laud,
And mak’st fair reputation but a bawd. ‘Hast thou command? By him that gave it thee,
From a pure heart command thy rebel will.
Draw not thy sword to guard iniquity,
For it was lent thee all that brood to kill.
Thy princely office how canst thou fulfil When, patterned by thy fault, foul sin may say
He learned to sin, and thou didst teach the way?
