Will not this malice, Somerset, be left? Your private grudge, my lord of York, will out,
Though neâ€™er so cunningly you smother it. Good Lord, what madness rules in brainsick men
When for so slight and frivolous a cause
Such factious emulations shall arise?
Good cousins both of York and Somerset,
Quiet yourselves, I pray, and be at peace.
