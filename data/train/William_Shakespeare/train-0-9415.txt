TAURUS My lord? Strike not by land. Keep whole. Provoke not battle
Till we have done at sea. (Giving a scroll) Do not

Upon this jump. Exit Caesar and his army at one door, Taurus at another 
3.9

In eye of Caesar’s battle, from which place
We may the number of the ships behold,
And so proceed accordingly.
