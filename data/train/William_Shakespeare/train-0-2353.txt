And straight, in pity of his tender years,
They both would strive who first should dry his tears. â€˜To see his face the lion walked along
Behind some hedge, because he would not fear him.
To recreate himself when he hath sung,
The tiger would be tame, and gently hear him. If he had spoke, the wolf would leave his prey,
And never fright the silly lamb that day.
