Anonymous, in Troilus and Cressida (1609) 
To our English Terence, Master Will Shakespeare Some say, good Will, which I in sport do sing,
Hadst thou not played some kingly parts in sport
Thou hadst been a companion for a king,
And been a king among the meaner sort.
Some others rail; but rail as they think fit,
Thou hast no railing but a reigning wit,
And honesty thou sowâ€™st, which they do reap
So to increase their stock which they do keep.
