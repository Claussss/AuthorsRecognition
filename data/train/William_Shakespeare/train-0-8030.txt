ABHORSON (to Barnardine) Look you, sir, here comes your ghostly father. Do we jest now, think you? DUKE (to Barnardine) Sir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastily you are to depart, I am come to advise you, comfort you, and pray with you. BARNARDINE Friar, not I. I have been drinking hard all night, and I will have more time to prepare me, or they shall beat out my brains with billets. I will not consent to die this day, thatâ€™s certain.
