Ay, my good lord. Our time does call upon â€™s. I wish your horses swift and sure of foot,
And so I do commend you to their backs.
Farewell. Exit Banquo
Let every man be master of his time
Till seven at night. To make society
The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself
Till supper-time alone. While then, God be with you.
Exeunt all but Macbeth and a Servant
Sirrah, a word with you. Attend those men
Our pleasure?
