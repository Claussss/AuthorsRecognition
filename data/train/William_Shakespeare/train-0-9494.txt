Enter Cleopatra, Charmian, Iras, Mardian Help me, my women! O, he’s more mad
Than Telamon for his shield; the boar of Thessaly
Was never so embossed. To th’ monument! There lock yourself, and send him word you are dead.
The soul and body rive not more in parting
Than greatness going off. To th’ monument!
