O Doricles, Your praises are too large. But that your youth
And the true blood which peeps so fairly through’t
Do plainly give you out an unstained shepherd,
With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,
You wooed me the false way. I think you have As little skill to fear as I have purpose
To put you to’t. But come, our dance, I pray;
Your hand, my Perdita. So turtles pair,
That never mean to part.
