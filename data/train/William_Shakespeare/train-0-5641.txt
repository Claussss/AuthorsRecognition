Another Hero! HERO Nothing certainer. One Hero died defiled, but I do live,
And surely as I live, I am a maid. The former Hero, Hero that is dead! She died, my lord, but whiles her slander lived. All this amazement can I qualify
When after that the holy rites are ended
I’ll tell you largely of fair Hero’s death.
Meantime, let wonder seem familiar,
And to the chapel let us presently.
