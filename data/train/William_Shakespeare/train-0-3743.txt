Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.
Proud can I never be of what I hate,
But thankful even for hate that is meant love. How, how, how, how—chopped logic? What is this?
‘Proud’, and ‘I thank you’, and ’I thank you not’,
And yet ‘not proud’ ? Mistress minion, you,
Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,
But fettle your fine joints ’gainst Thursday next
To go with Paris to Saint Peter’s Church,
Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
Out, you green-sickness carrion! Out, you baggage,
You tallow-face!
