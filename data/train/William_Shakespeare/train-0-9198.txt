GENTLEWOMAN Good night, good doctor. 
5.2
Enter Menteith, Caithness, Angus, Lennox, soldiers, with a drummer and colours The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,
His uncle Siward, and the good Macduff.
Revenges burn in them, for their dear causes
Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm
Excite the mortified man.
