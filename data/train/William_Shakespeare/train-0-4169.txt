Hubert stamps his foot Come forth! The Executioners come forth  Do as I bid you do. O, save me, Hubert, save me! My eyes are out
Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men. HUBERT (to the Executioners) Give me the iron, I say, and bind him here. He takes the iron Alas, what need you be so boisterous-rough?
I will not struggle; I will stand stone-still.
For God’s sake, Hubert, let me not be bound.
Nay, hear me, Hubert Drive these men away,
And I will sit as quiet as a lamb;
I will not stir, nor wince, nor speak a word, 80
Nor look upon the iron angerly.
Thrust but these men away, and I’ll forgive you,
Whatever torment you do put me to.
