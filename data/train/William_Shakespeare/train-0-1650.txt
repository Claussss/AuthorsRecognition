My lord, this is impiety in you.
My nephew Mutius’ deeds do plead for him.
He must be buried with his brethren. and MARTIUS And shall, or him we will accompany. ‘And shall’? What villain was it spake that word? He that would vouch it in any place but here. What, would you bury him in my despite? No, noble Titus, but entreat of thee
To pardon Mutius and to bury him.
