Exeunt his soldiers and followers Friends that have been thus forward in my right,
I thank you all, and here dismiss you all,
And to the love and favour of my country
Commit myself, my person, and the cause. Exeunt his soldiers and followers (To the Tribunes and Senators)
Rome, be as just and gracious unto me
As I am confident and kind to thee.
Open the gates and let me in.
