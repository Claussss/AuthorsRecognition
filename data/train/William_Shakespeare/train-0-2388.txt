Honour for wealth; and oft that wealth doth cost
The death of all, and all together lost. So that, in ventâ€™ring ill, we leave to be
The things we are for that which we expect,
And this ambitious foul infirmity
In having much, torments us with defect
Of that we have; so then we do neglect The thing we have, and all for want of wit
Make something nothing by augmenting it.
