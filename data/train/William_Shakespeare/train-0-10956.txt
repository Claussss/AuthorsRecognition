Where hast thou sent the King? Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charged at peril— Wherefore to Dover?—Let him answer that. I am tied to th’ stake, and I must stand the course. REGAN Wherefore to Dover? Because I would not see thy cruel nails
Pluck out his poor old eyes, nor thy fierce sister
In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.
The sea, with such a storm as his bare head
In hell-black night endured, would have buoyed up
And quenched the stell
Yet, poor old heart, he holp the heavens to rain.
If wolves had at thy gate howled that stern time,
Thou shouldst have said ‘Good porter, turn the key;
All cruels I’ll subscribe.’ But I shall see
The winged vengeance overtake such children.
