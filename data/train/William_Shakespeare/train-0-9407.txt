What is’t you say? Your presence needs must puzzle Antony,
Take from his heart, take from his brain, from’s time
What should not then be spared. He is already
Traduced for levity; and ’tis said in Rome
That Photinus, an eunuch, and your maids
Manage this war. Sink Rome, and their tongues rot That speak against us! A charge we bear i’th’ war,
And as the president of my kingdom will
Appear there for a man. Speak not against it.
I will not stay behind.
