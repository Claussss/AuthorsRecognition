’Tis a good title. I am persuaded this question, sick between’s,
By bleeding must be cured. I am a suitor
That to your sword you will bequeath this plea
And talk of it no more. But this one word: You are going now to gaze upon my mistress—
For note you, mine she is— ARCITE Nay then— Nay, pray you—You talk of feeding me to breed me strength—
You are going now to look upon a sun
That strengthens what it looks on. There you have
A vantage o’er me, but enjoy it till
I may enforce my remedy. Farewell.
