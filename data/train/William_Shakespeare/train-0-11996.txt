Thou dar’st not, fool; thou canst not; thou art feeble.
Put my head out? I’ll throw my body out
And leap the garden when I see her next, Enter the Jailer above And pitch between her arms to anger thee. No more—the keeper’s coming. I shall live
To knock thy brains out with my shackles. By your leave, gentlemen.
