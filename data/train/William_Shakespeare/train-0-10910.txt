Shut up your doors, my lord. ‘Tis a wild night.
My Regan counsels well. Come out o’th’ storm. Exeunt 3.1
Storm still. Enter the Earl of Kent disguised and the FirstGentleman, severally Who’s there, besides foul weather? One minded like the weather, Most unquietly. I know you. Where’s the King? Contending with the fretful elements;
Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea
Or swell the curled waters ’bove the main,
That things might change or cease.
