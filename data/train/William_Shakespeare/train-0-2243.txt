Scorning his churlish drum and ensign red,
Making my arms his field, his tent my bed. ‘Thus he that over-ruled I overswayed,
Leading him prisoner in a red-rose chain.
Strong-tempered steel his stronger strength obeyed,
Yet was he servile to my coy disdain. O, be not proud, nor brag not of thy might,
For mast’ring her that foiled the god of fight.
