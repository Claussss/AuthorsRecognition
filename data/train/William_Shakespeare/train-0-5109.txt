SIR JOHN I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so patient. Your lordship may minister the potion of imprisonment to me in respect of poverty; but how I should be your patient to follow your prescriptions, the wise may make some dram of a scruple, or indeed a scruple itself. LORD CHIEF JUSTICE I sent for you, when there were matters against you for your life, to come speak with me.
