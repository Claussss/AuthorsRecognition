Brother, you have a vice of mercy in you,
Which better fits a lion than a man. What vice is that? Good Troilus, chide me for it. When many times the captive Grecian falls
Even in the fan and wind of your fair sword,
You bid them rise and live. HECTOR O ’tis fair play. TROILUS Fool’s play, by heaven, Hector.
