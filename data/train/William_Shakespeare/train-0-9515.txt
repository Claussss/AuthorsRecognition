One word, sweet queen. Of Caesar seek your honour, with your safety. O! They do not go together. Gentle, hear me. None about Caesar trust but Proculeius. My resolution and my hands I’ll trust,
None about Caesar. The miserable change now at my end
Lament nor sorrow at, but please your thoughts
In feeding them with those my former fortunes,
Wherein I lived the greatest prince o’th’ world,
The noblest; and do now not basely die,
Not cowardly put off my helmet to
My countryman; a Roman by a Roman
Valiantly vanquished. Now my spirit is going;
I can no more.
