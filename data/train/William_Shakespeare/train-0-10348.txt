Exeunt Coriolanus, Cominius, and Menenius, with the rest of the Patricians. The Citizens all shout, and throw up their caps The peopleâ€™s enemy is gone, is gone. ALL THE CITIZENS Our enemy is banished, he is gone. Hoo-oo! Go see him out at gates, and follow him
As he hath followed you, with all despite.
Give him deserved vexation. Let a guard
Attend us through the city.
