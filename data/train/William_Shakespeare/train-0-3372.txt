To horse, to horse! Urge doubts to them that fear. Hold out my horse, and I will first be there. 
2.2
Enter the Queen, Bushy, and Bagot Madam, your majesty is too much sad.
You promised when you parted with the King
To lay aside life-harming heaviness
And entertain a cheerful disposition. To please the King I did; to please myself
I cannot do it. Yet I know no cause
Why I should welcome such a guest as grief,
Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest
As my sweet Richard. Yet again, methinks
Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortuneâ€™s womb,
Is coming towards me; and my inward soul
At nothing trembles. With something it grieves
More than with parting from my lord the King.
