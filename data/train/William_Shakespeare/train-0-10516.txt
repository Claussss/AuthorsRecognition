Enter Polixenes Happy star reign now! Here comes Bohemia. POLIXENES (aside) This is strange. Methinks My favour here begins to warp. Not speak?—
Good day, Camillo. Hail, most royal sir. What is the news i’th’ court? CAMILLO None rare, my lord. The King hath on him such a countenance
As he had lost some province, and a region
Loved as he loves himself. Even now I met him
With customary compliment, when he,
Wafting his eyes to th’ contrary, and falling
A lip of much contempt, speeds from me, and
So leaves me to consider what is breeding
That changes thus his manners.
