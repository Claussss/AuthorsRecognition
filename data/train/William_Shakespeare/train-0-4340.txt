‘Tis now but four o’clock. We have two hours
To furnish us. Enter Lancelot with a letter Friend Lancelot, what’s the news? LANCELOT (presenting the letter) An it shall please you to break up this, it shall seem to signify. 11 LORENZO (taking the letter) I know the hand. In faith, ’tis a fair hand,
And whiter than the paper it writ on
Is the fair hand that writ.
