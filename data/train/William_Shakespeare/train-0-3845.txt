O cross!—too high to be enthralled to low. Or else misgrafted in respect of years— O spite!—too old to be engaged to young. Or merit stood upon the choice of friends— O hell!—to choose love by another’s eyes. Or if there were a sympathy in choice,
War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,
Making it momentany as a sound,
Swift as a shadow, short as any dream,
Brief as the lightning in the collied night,
That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,
And, ere a man hath power to say ‘Behold!’
The jaws of darkness do devour it up.
So quick bright things come to confusion.
