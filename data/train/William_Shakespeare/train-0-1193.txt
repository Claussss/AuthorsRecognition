Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,
Whom thou obeyedest thirty and six years,
And not bewray thy treason with a blush? Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,
Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?
For shame—leave Henry, and call Edward king. Call him my king by whose injurious doom
My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,
Was done to death ? And more than so, my father,
Even in the downfall of his mellowed years,
When nature brought him to the door of death?
No, Warwick, no—while life upholds this arm,
This arm upholds the house of Lancaster.
