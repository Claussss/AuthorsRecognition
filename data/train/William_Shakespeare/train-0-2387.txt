Is but to surfeit and such griefs sustain
That they prove bankrupt in this poor-rich gain. The aim of all is but to nurse the life
With honour, wealth, and ease in waning age,
And in this aim there is such thwarting strife
That one for all, or all for one, we gage,
As life for honour in fell battleâ€™s rage,
