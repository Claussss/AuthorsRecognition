PRINCE OF WALES Yes, my good lord, and not two hours ago,
With full a hundred thousand fighting men
Upon the one side with the riverâ€™s bank,
And on the other, both his multitudes.
I feared he would have cropped our smaller power,
But happily, perceiving your approach,
He hath withdrawn himself to Cr
Where, as it seemeth by his good array,
He means to bid us battle presently.
