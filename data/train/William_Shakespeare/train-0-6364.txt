PHOEBE (to Rosalind) Youth, you have done me much ungentleness,
To show the letter that I writ to you. I care not if I have. It is my study
To seem despiteful and ungentle to you.
You are there followed by a faithful shepherd.
Look upon him; love him. He worships you. PHOEBE (to Silvius) Good shepherd, tell this youth what â€™tis to love.
