Graze on my lips, and if those hills be dry,
Stray lower, where the pleasant fountains lie. ‘Within this limit is relief enough,
Sweet bottom-grass, and high delightful plain,
Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,
To shelter thee from tempest and from rain. Then be my deer, since I am such a park;
No dog shall rouse thee, though a thousand bark.’
