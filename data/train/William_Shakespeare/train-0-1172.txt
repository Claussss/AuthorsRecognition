The match is made—she seals it with a curtsy. KING EDWARD (to Lady Gray) But stay thee—’tis the fruits of love I mean. The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege. KING EDWARD Ay, but I fear me in another sense.
What love think’st thou I sue so much to get? My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers—
That love which virtue begs and virtue grants.
