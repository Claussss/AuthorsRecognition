2.3
Enter at one doorthe Duke, disguised as a friar, and at another doorthe Provost Hail to you, Provost!—so I think you are. I am the Provost. What’s your will, good friar? Bound by my charity and my blest order,
I come to visit the afflicted spirits
Here in the prison. Do me the common right
To let me see them, and to make me know
The nature of their crimes, that I may minister
To them accordingly.
