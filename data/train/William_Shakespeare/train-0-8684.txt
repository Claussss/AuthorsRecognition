GLOUCESTER Away, and let me die. Hadst thou been aught but goss‘mer, feathers, air,
So many fathom down precipitating
Thou hadst shivered like an egg. But thou dost breathe,
Hast heavy substance, bleed’st not, speak’st, art sound.
Ten masts a-length make not the altitude
Which thou hast perpendicularly fell.
Thy life’s a miracle. Speak yet again.
