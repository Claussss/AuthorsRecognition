5.2
Enter the Duke and Duchess of York 
DUCHESS OF YORK My lord, you told me you would tell the rest,
When weeping made you break the story off,
Of our two cousins’ coming into London. Where did I leave? DUCHESS OF YORK At that sad stop, my lord, Where rude misgoverned hands from windows’ tops
Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard’s head.
