Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes
That have been so bedazzled with the sun
That everything I look on seemeth green.
Now I perceive thou art a reverend father.
Pardon, I pray thee, for my mad mistaking. Do, good old grandsire, and withal make known
Which way thou travellâ€™st. If along with us,
We shall be joyful of thy company.
