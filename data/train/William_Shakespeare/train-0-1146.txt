From off the gates of York fetch down the head,
Your father’s head, which Clifford placed there.
Instead whereof let this supply the room—
Measure for measure must be answer Bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house,
That nothing sung but death to us and ours. Clifford is dragged forward Now death shall stop his dismal threat’ning sound
And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak.
