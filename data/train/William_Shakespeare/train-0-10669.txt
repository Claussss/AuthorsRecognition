I would your spirit were easier for advice,
Or stronger for your need. Hark, Perdita— (To Camillo) I’ll hear you by and by. CAMILLO (aside) He’s irremovable, Resolved for flight. Now were I happy if
His going I could frame to serve my turn,
Save him from danger, do him love and honour,
Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia
And that unhappy king, my master, whom
I so much thirst to see.
