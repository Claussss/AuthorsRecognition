Adieu, good neighbour. Exit Baptista
Now I fear thee not. Sirrah, young gamester, your father were a fool
To give thee all, and in his waning age
Set foot under thy table. Tut, a toy ! I
An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy. A vengeance on your crafty withered hide!
Yet I have faced it with a card of ten.
‘Tis in my head to do my master good.
I see no reason but supposed Lucentio
Must get a father called supposed Vincentio—
And that’s a wonder; fathers commonly
Do get their children, but in this case of wooing
A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.
