One from Lord Stanley. Enter Lord Hastings LORD HASTINGS What is’t o’clock? Upon the stroke of four. LORD HASTINGS Cannot my Lord Stanley sleep these tedious nights? So it appears by that I have to say.
First he commends him to your noble self. LORD HASTINGS What then? Then certifies your lordship that this night
He dreamt the boar had razed off his helm.
Besides, he says there are two councils kept,
And that may be determined at the one
Which may make you and him to rue at th’other.
Therefore he sends to know your lordship’s pleasure,
If you will presently take horse with him,
And with all speed post with him toward the north
To shun the danger that his soul divines.
