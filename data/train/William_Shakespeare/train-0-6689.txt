It must be shortly known to him from England
What is the issue of the business there. It will be short. The interim’s mine,
And a man’s life’s no more than to say ‘one’.
But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
That to Laertes I forgot myself;
For by the image of my cause I see
The portraiture of his. I’ll court his favours.
But sure, the bravery of his grief did put me
Into a tow’ring passion.
