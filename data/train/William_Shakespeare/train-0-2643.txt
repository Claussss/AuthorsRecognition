LODOWICK There’s all that yet is done. KING EDWARD I thank thee then. Thou hast done little ill,
But what is done is passing passing ill.
No, let the captain talk of boist’rous war,
The prisoner of emur
The sick man best sets down the pangs of death,
The man that starves the sweetness of a feast,
The frozen soul the benefit of fire,
And every grief his happy opposite.
Love cannot sound well but in lovers’ tongues.
Give me the pen and paper. I will write.
