Enter Julia and Lucetta Counsel, Lucetta. Gentle girl, assist me,
And eâ€™en in kind love I do conjure thee,
Who art the table wherein all my thoughts
Are visibly charactered and engraved,
To lesson me, and tell me some good mean
How with my honour I may undertake
A journey to my loving Proteus. Alas, the way is wearisome and long.
