SECOND LORD DUMAINE They shall be no more than needful there, if they were more than they can commend. Enter Bertram BERTRAM I have tonight dispatched sixteen businesses, a monthâ€™s length apiece. By an abstract of success: I have cong with the Duke, done my adieu with his nearest, buried a wife, mourned for her, writ to my lady mother I am returning, entertained my convoy, and between these main parcels of dispatch affected many nicer needs. The last was the greatest, but that I have not ended yet.
