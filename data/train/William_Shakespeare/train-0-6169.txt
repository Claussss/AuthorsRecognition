CELIA Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your years. You have seen cruel proof of this manâ€™s strength. If you saw yourself with your eyes, or knew yourself with your judgement, the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal enterprise. We pray you for your own sake to embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.
