Enter other Servants More of our fellows. All broken implements of a ruined house. THIRD SERVANT Yet do our hearts wear Timon’s livery.
That see I by our faces. We are fellows still,
Serving alike in sorrow. Leaked is our barque,
And we, poor mates, stand on the dying deck
Hearing the surges’ threat. We must all part
Into this sea of air.
