Exeunt with Cloten’s body 4.3
Enter Cymbeline, Lords, and Pisanio Again, and bring me word how ’tis with her. Exit one or more A fever with the absence of her son,
A madness of which her life’s in danger-heavens,
How deeply you at once do touch me! Innogen,
The great part of my comfort, gone; my queen
Upon a desperate bed, and in a time
When fearful wars point at me; her son gone,
So needful for this present! It strikes me past
The hope of comfort. (To Pisanio) But for thee, fellow,
Who needs must know of her departure and
Dost seem so ignorant, we’ll enforce it from thee
By a sharp torture.
