Bassianus, Lavinia, Lucius, Quintus, and
Martius kneel We do, and vow to heaven and to his highness
That what we did was mildly as we might,
Tend’ring our sister’s honour and our own. MARCUS kneeling That on mine honour here do I protest. Away, and talk not, trouble us no more. Nay, nay, sweet Emperor, we must all be friends.
The Tribune and his nephews kneel for grace.
I will not be denied; sweetheart, look back.
