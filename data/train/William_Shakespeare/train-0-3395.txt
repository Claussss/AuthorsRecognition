My lord, my answer is to ‘Lancaster’,
And I am come to seek that name in England,
And I must find that title in your tongue
Before I make reply to aught you say. Mistake me not, my lord, ’tis not my meaning
To raze one title of your honour out.
To you, my lord, I come—what lord you will—
From the most gracious regent of this land,
The Duke of York, to know what pricks you on
To take advantage of the absent time
And fright our native peace with self-borne arms.
