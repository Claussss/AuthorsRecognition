SEBASTIAN A spirit I am indeed, But am in that dimension grossly clad
Which from the womb I did participate.
Were you a woman, as the rest goes even,
I should my tears let fall upon your cheek
And say ‘Thrice welcome, drowned Viola.’ My father had a mole upon his brow SEBASTIAN And so had mine. And died that day when Viola from her birth
Had numbered thirteen years.
