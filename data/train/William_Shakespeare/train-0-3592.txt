A torch for me. Let wantons light of heart
Tickle the sense-less rushes with their heels,
For I am proverbed with a grandsire phrase.
I’ll be a candle-holder and look on.
The game was ne’er so fair, and I am done.
He takes a torch Tut, dun’s the mouse, the constable’s own word.
If thou art dun we’ll draw thee from the mire
Of—save your reverence—love, wherein thou stickest
Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
