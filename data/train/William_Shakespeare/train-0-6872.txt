VIOLA Thy reason, man? FESTE Troth, sir, I can yield you none without words, and words are grown so false I am loath to prove reason with them. VIOLA I warrant thou art a merry fellow, and carest for nothing. FESTE Not so, sir, I do care for something; but in my conscience, sir, I do not care for you. If that be to care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you invisible.
