Enter Lorenzo JESSICA I’ll tell my husband, Lancelot, what you say. Here he comes. LORENZO I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Lancelot, if you thus get my wife into corners. JESSICA Nay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo. Lancelot and I are out. He tells me flatly there’s no mercy for me in heaven because I am a Jew’s daughter, and he says you are no good member of the commonwealth, for in converting Jews to Christians you raise the price of pork.
