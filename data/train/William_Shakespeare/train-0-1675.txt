Lavinia, how say you? I have been broad awake two hours and more. Come on then, horse and chariots let us have,
And to our sport. (To Tamora) Madam, now shall ye see
Our Roman hunting. I have dogs, my lord, Will rouse the proudest panther in the chase,
And climb the highest promontory top. And I have horse will follow where the game
Makes way, and run like swallows oâ€™er the plain.
