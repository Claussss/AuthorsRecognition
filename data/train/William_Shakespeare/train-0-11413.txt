More to know Did never meddle with my thoughts. I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,
And pluck my magic garment from me. Miranda removes Prospero’s cloak, and he lays it
on the ground Lie there, my art.—Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.
The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touched
The very virtue of compassion in thee,
I have with such provision in mine art
So safely ordered that there is no soul—
No, not so much perdition as an hair
Betid to any creature in the vessel,
Which thou heard‘st cry, which thou saw’st sink. Sit
down,
For thou must now know farther.
