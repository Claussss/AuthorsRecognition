Is’t possible? HAMLET (giving it to him) Here’s the commission. Read it at more leisure.
But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed? HORATIO I beseech you. Being thus benetted round with villainies—
Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,
They had begun the play—sat me down,
Devised a new commission, wrote it fair.
I once did hold it, as our statists do,
A baseness to write fair, and laboured much
How to forget that learning; but, sir, now
It did me yeoman’s service. Wilt thou know
Th’effect of what I wrote?
