3.2
Enter Nim, Bardolph, Ensign Pistol, and Boy 
BARDOLPH On, on, on, on, oh! To the breach, to the breach! NIM Pray thee corporal, stay. The knocks are too hot, and for mine own part I have not a case of lives. The humour of it is too hot, that is the very plainsong of it. 6 ’The plainsong’ is most just, for humours do abound.
Knocks go and come, God’s vassals drop and die,
sings
In bloody field
