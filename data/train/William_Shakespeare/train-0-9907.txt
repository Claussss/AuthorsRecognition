Our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it. O, let those cities that of plenty’s cup
And her prosperities so largely taste
With their superfluous riots, heed these tears!
The misery of Tarsus may be theirs. Enter a faintingLord of Tarsus slowly LORD Where’s the Lord Governor? Here. Speak out thy sorrows which thou bring‘st in
haste,
For comfort is too far for us t’expect.
