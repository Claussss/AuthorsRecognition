FIRST MURDERER Offended us you have not, but the King. I shall be reconciled to him again. SECOND MURDERER Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die. Are you drawn forth among a world of men
To slay the innocent? What is my offence?
Where is the evidence that doth accuse me?
What lawful quest have given their verdict up
Unto the frowning judge, or who pronounced
The bitter sentence of poor Clarence’ death?
Before I be convict by course of law,
To threaten me with death is most unlawful.
I charge you, as you hope to have redemption
By Christ’s dear blood, shed for our grievous sins,
That you depart and lay no hands on me.
The deed you undertake is damnable.
