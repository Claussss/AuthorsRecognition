SCHOOLMASTER Fie, fie, What tediosity and disinsanity
Is here among yet Have my rudiments
Been laboured so long with ye, milked unto ye,
And, by a figure, even the very plum-broth
And marrow of my understanding laid upon ye?
And do you still cry ‘where?’ and ‘how?’ and
‘wherefore?’
You most coarse frieze capacities, ye jean judgements,
Have I said, ‘thus let be’, and ‘there let be’,
And ‘then let be’, and no man understand me?
Proh deum, medius fidius-ye are all dunces.
Forwhy, here stand I. Here the Duke comes. There are
you,
Close in the thicket. The Duke appears. I meet him,
And unto him I utter learn
And many figures. He hears, and nods, and hums,
And then cries, ‘Rare!’, and I go forward. At length
I fling my cap up—mark there—then do you,
As once did Meleager and the boar,
Break comely out before him, like true lovers,
Cast yourselves in a body decently,
And sweetly, by a figure, trace and turn, boys.
