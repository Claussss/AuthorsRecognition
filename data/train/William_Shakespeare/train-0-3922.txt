Out, dog; out, cur. Thou driv’st me past the bounds
Of maiden’s patience. Hast thou slain him then?
Henceforth be never numbered among men.
O, once tell true; tell true, even for my sake.
Durst thou have looked upon him being awake,
And hast thou killed him sleeping? O brave touch!
Could not a worm, an adder do so much?—
An adder did it, for with doubler tongue
Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.
