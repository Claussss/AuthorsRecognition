Caesar, I shall. Exit Gallus, go you along. Exit Gallus Where’s Dolabella, To second Proculeius? ALL BUT CAESAR Let him alone; for I remember now
How he’s employed. He shall in time be ready.
Go with me to my tent, where you shall see
How hardly I was drawn into this war,
How calm and gentle I proceeded still
In all my writings. Go with me, and see
What I can show in this.
