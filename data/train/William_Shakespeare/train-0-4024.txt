5.1
Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, and Philostrate ’Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of. More strange than true. I never may believe
These antique fables, nor these fairy toys.
Lovers and mad men have such seething brains.
One sees more devils than vast hell can hold: 5
That is the madman. The lover, all as frantic,
Sees Helen’s beauty in a brow of Egypt.
Such tricks hath strong imagination
That if it would but apprehend some joy
It comprehends some bringer of that joy; 10
Or in the night, imagining some fear,
How easy is a bush supposed a bear!
