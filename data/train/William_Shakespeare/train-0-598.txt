Travel you farre on, or are you at the farthest? Sir, at the farthest for a week or two,
But then up farther and as far as Rome,
And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life. What countryman, I pray? Of Mantua, sir? Marry, God forbid,
And come to Padua careless of your life! My life, sir? How, I pray? For that goes hard.
