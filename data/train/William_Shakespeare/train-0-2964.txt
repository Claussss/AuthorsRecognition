ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad. O that thou wert not, poor distressed soul. ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS You minion, you, are these your customers?
Did this companion with the saffron face
Revel and feast it at my house today,
Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut,
And I denied to enter in my house?
