Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,
If thou but think‘st him wronged and mak’st his ear
A stranger to thy thoughts. IAGO I do beseech you, Though I perchance am vicious in my guess—
As I confess it is my nature’s plague
To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy
Shapes faults that are not—that your wisdom then,
From one that so imperfectly conceits,
Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble
Out of his scattering and unsure observance.
It were not for your quiet nor your good,
Nor for my manhood, honesty, and wisdom,
To let you know my thoughts.
