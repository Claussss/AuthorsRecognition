Here music.A song the whilst Bassanio comments on the caskets to himself Tell me where is fancy bred,
Or in the heart, or in the head?
How begot, how nourished? It is engendered in the eyes,
With gazing fed; and fancy dies
In the cradle where it lies.
Let us all ring fancy’s knell.
I’ll begin it: ding, dong, bell.
