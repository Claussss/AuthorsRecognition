IAGO Why did he so? I do not know. I am sure I am none such. Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day! Hath she forsook so many noble matches,
Her father and her country and her friends,
To be called whore? Would it not make one weep? It is my wretched fortune. IAGO Beshrew him forâ€™t. How comes this trick upon him?
