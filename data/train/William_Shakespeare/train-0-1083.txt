Ay, ay, so strives the woodcock with the gin. NORTHUMBERLAND So doth the cony struggle in the net. So triumph thieves upon their conquered booty,
So true men yield, with robbers so o’ermatched. NORTHUMBERLAND (to the Queen) What would your grace have done unto him now? QUEEN MARGARET Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland,
Come make him stand upon this molehill here,
That wrought at mountains with outstretched arms
Yet parted but the shadow with his hand.
(To York) What—was it you that would be England’s
king?
Was’t you that revelled in our Parliament,
And made a preachment of your high descent?
Where are your mess of sons to back you now?
The wanton Edward and the lusty George?
And where’s that valiant crookback prodigy,
Dickie, your boy, that with his grumbling voice
Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies?
Or with the rest where is your darling Rutland?
Look, York, I stained this napkin with the blood
That valiant Clifford with his rapier’s point
Made issue from the bosom of thy boy.
And if thine eyes can water for his death,
I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal.
Alas, poor York, but that I hate thee deadly
I should lament thy miserable state.
I prithee, grieve, to make me merry, York.
What—hath thy fiery heart so parched thine entrails
That not a tear can fall for Rutland’s death?
Why art thou patient, man? Thou shouldst be mad,
And I, to make thee mad, do mock thee thus.
Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance.
Thou wouldst be fee’d, I see, to make me sport.
York cannot speak unless he wear a crown.
(To her men) A crown for York, and, lords, bow low to
him.
Hold you his hands whilst I do set it on.
