KING EDWARD Ay, if thou wilt say ‘ay’ to my request;
No, if thou dost say ‘no’ to my demand. Then, no, my lord—my suit is at an end. RICHARD OF GLOUCESTER (to George) The widow likes him not—she knits her brows. GEORGE OF CLARENCE He is the bluntest wooer in Christendom. KING EDWARD (aside) Her looks doth argue her replete with modesty;
Her words doth show her wit incomparable;
All her perfections challenge sovereignty.
One way or other, she is for a king;
And she shall be my love or else my queen.
(To Lady Gray) Say that King Edward take thee for his
queen?
