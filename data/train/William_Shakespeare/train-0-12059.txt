I shall think either,
 Well done, a noble recompense. Then I shall quit you. Defy me in these fair terms, and you show
More than a mistress to me—no more anger,
As you love anything that’s honourable.
We were not bred to talk, man. When we are armed
And both upon our guards, then let our fury,
Like meeting of two tides, fly strongly from us;
And then to whom the birthright of this beauty
Truly pertains—without upbraidings, scorns,
Despisings of our persons, and such poutings
Fitter for girls and schoolboys—will be seen,
And quickly, yours or mine. Will’t please you arm,
sir?
Or, if you feel yourself not fitting yet,
And furnished with your old strength, I’ll stay,
cousin,
And every day discourse you into health,
As I am spared. Your person I am friends with,
And I could wish I had not said I loved her,
Though I had died; but loving such a lady,
And justifying my love, I must not fly from’t.
