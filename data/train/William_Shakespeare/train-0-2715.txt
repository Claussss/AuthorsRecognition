KING EDWARD He shall be welcome. That’s the thing we crave. Enter Jean King of France, the Dauphin, the
Duc de Lorraine, the King of Bohemia, young
Prince Philippe and soldiers KING OF FRANCE Edward, know that Jean, the true King of France,
Musing thou shouldst encroach upon his land
And, in thy tyrannous proceeding, slay
His faithful subjects and subvert his towns,
Spits in thy face, and, in this manner following,
Upbraids thee with thine arrogant intrusion.
First, I condemn thee for a fugitive,
A thievish pirate and a needy mate,
One that hath either no abiding-place
Or else, inhabiting some barren soil,
Where neither herb or fruitful grain is had,
Dost altogether live by pilfering.
Next, insomuch thou hast infringed thy faith,
Broke league and solemn covenant made with me,
I hold thee for a false, pernicious wretch.
And last of all, although I scorn to cope
With one so much inferior to myself,
Yet in respect thy thirst is all for gold,
Thy labour rather to be feared than loved,
To satisfy thy lust, in either part,
Here am I come and with me have I brought
Exceeding store of treasure, pearl and coin.
Leave, therefore, now to persecute the weak,
And armed ent‘ring conflict with the armed,
Let it be seen, ’mongst other petty thefts,
How thou canst win this pillage manfully.
