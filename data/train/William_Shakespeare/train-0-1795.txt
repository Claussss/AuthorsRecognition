Touch not the boy; he is of royal blood. Too like the sire for ever being good.
First hang the child, that he may see it sprawl—
A sight to vex the father’s soul withal.
Get me a ladder. A Goth brings a ladder which Aaron climbs Lucius, save the child, And bear it from me to the Empress.
If thou do this, I’ll show thee wondrous things
That highly may advantage thee to hear.
If thou wilt not, befall what may befall,
I’ll speak no more but ‘Vengeance rot you all!’
