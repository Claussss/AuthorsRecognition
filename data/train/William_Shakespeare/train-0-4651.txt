I’ll have it so; a little charge will do it. HOTSPUR Will not you? HOTSPUR Who shall say me nay? 115 Let me not understand you, then: speak it in Welsh. I can speak English, lord, as well as you; For I was trained up in the English court,
Where, being but young, I framed to the harp
Many an English ditty lovely well,
And gave the tongue a helpful ornament—
A virtue that was never seen in you.
