But not a sceptre to control the world.
Upright he held it, lords, that held it last. Titus, thou shalt obtain and ask the empery. Proud and ambitious Tribune, canst thou tell? Patience, Prince Saturninus. Romans, do me right. Patricians, draw your swords, and sheathe them not

Andronicus, would thou were shipped to hell
Rather than rob me of the people’s hearts!
