And we must sleep. (To Mardian) That thou depart’st
hence safe
Does pay thy labour richly. Go. Exit Mardian Off, pluck off. Eros helps Antony to unarm The seven-fold shield of Ajax cannot keep
The battery from my heart. O, cleave, my sides!
Heart, once be stronger than thy continent;
Crack thy frail case. Apace, Eros, apace.
No more a soldier. Bruised pieces, go;
You have been nobly borne.—From me a while.
