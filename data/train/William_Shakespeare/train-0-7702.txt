When she cometh in place
You must her embrace
Somewhat handsomely,
Lest she think it danger
Because you are a stranger
To come in your company. I warrant thee, Inclination, I will be busy.
O, how Wit longs to be in Wisdomâ€™s company! Enter Lady Vanity, singing and beckoning with her hand Come hither, come hither, come hither, come.
Such cheer as I have, thou shalt have some.
