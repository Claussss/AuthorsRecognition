Will you, Arcite,
 Take these conditions? He’s a villain then. These are men! No, never, Duke. ’Tis worse to me than begging,
To take my life so basely. Though I think
I never shall enjoy her, yet I’ll preserve
The honour of affection and die for her,
Make death a devil. What may be done? For now I feel compassion.
