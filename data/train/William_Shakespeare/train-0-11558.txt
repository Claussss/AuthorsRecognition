But one fiend at a time, I’ll fight their legions o’er. I’ll be thy second. Exeunt Sebastian and Antonio All three of them are desperate. Their great guilt,
Like poison given to work a great time after,
Now ’gins to bite the spirits. I do beseech you
That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly,
And hinder them from what this ecstasy
May now provoke them to.
