BRUTUS Fates, we will know your pleasures. That we shall die, we know; ‘tis but the time
And drawing days out that men stand upon. Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life
Cuts off so many years of fearing death. Grant that, and then is death a benefit.
So are we Caesar’s friends, that have abridged
His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,
And let us bathe our hands in Caesar’s blood
Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords;
Then walk we forth even to the market-place,
And, waving our red weapons o‘er our heads,
Let’s all cry ‘peace, freedom, and liberty!’
