Such hazard now must doting Tarquin make,
Pawning his honour to obtain his lust,
And for himself himself he must forsake.
Then where is truth if there be no self-trust?
When shall he think to find a stranger just When he himself himself confounds, betrays
To slandâ€™rous tongues and wretched hateful days?
