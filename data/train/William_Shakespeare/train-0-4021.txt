Now until the break of day
Through this house each fairy stray.
To the best bride bed will we,
Which by us shall bless
And the issue there create
Ever shall be fortunate.
So shall all the couples three
Ever true in loving be,
And the blots of natureâ€™s hand
Shall not in their issue stand.
Never mole, harelip, nor scar,
Nor mark prodigious such as are
Despised in nativity
Shall upon their children be.
With this field-dew consecrate
Every fairy take his gait
And each several chamber bless
Through this palace with sweet peace;
And the owner of it blessed
Ever shall in safety rest.
Trip away, make no stay,
Meet me all by break of day. Exeunt all but Robin
