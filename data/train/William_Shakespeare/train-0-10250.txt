MENENIUS Worthy man. He cannot but with measure fit the honours
Which we devise him. COMINIUS Our spoils he kicked at, And looked upon things precious as they were
The common muck of the world. He covets less
Than misery itself would give, rewards
His deeds with doing them, and is content
To spend the time to end it.
