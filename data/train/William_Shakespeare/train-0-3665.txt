ROMEO What sayst thou, my dear Nurse? Is your man secret? Did you ne‘er hear say
‘Two may keep counsel, putting one away’ ? I warrant thee my man’s as true as steel. Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady.
Lord, Lord, when ’twas a little prating thing—
O, there is a nobleman in town, one Paris,
That would fain lay knife aboard; but she, good soul,
Had as lief see a toad, a very toad,
As see him. I anger her sometimes,
And tell her that Paris is the properer man;
But I’ll warrant you, when I say so she looks
As pale as any clout in the versal world.
Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin
Both with a letter?
