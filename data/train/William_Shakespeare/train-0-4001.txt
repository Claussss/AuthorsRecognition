BOTTOM (as Pyramus) I see a voice. Now will I to the chink
To spy an I can hear my Thisbe’s face.
Thisbe? FLUTE (as Thisbe) My love—thou art my love, I think. BOTTOM (as Pyramus) Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover’s grace,
And like Lemander am I trusty still. FLUTE (as Thisbe) And I like Helen, till the fates me kill.
