Ay, almost stain—for he is taken prisoner,
Either betrayed by falsehood of his guard
Or by his foe surprised at unawares,
And, as I further have to understand,
Is new committed to the Bishop of York,
Fell Warwick’s brother, and by that our foe.
RIVERS These news, I must confess, are full of grief.
Yet, gracious madam, bear it as you may.
Warwick may lose, that now hath won the day.
