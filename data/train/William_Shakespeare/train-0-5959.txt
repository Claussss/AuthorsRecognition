Peace, count the clock. CASSIUS The clock hath stricken three. â€™Tis time to part. CASSIUS But it is doubtful yet Whether Caesar will come forth today or no;
For he is superstitious grown of late,
Quite from the main opinion he held once
Of fantasy, of dreams and ceremonies.
It may be these apparent prodigies,
The unaccustomed terror of this night,
And the persuasion of his augurers,
May hold him from the Capitol today.
