TIMON Wilt dine with me, Apemantus? APEMANTUS No, I eat not lords. TIMON An thou shouldst, thou’dst anger ladies. APEMANTUS O, they eat lords. So they come by great bellies. That’s a lascivious apprehension. So thou apprehend’st it; take it for thy labour. How dost thou like this jewel, Apemantus? APEMANTUS Not so well as plain dealing, which will not cost a man a doit.
