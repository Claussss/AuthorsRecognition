ANTONIO (to Portia) Sweet lady, you have given me life and living,
For here I read for certain that my ships
Are safely come to road. PORTIA How now, Lorenzo? My clerk hath some good comforts, too, for you. Ay, and Iâ€™ll give them him without a fee. There do I give to you and Jessica
From the rich Jew a special deed of gift,
After his death, of all he dies possessed of.
