You are my mother, madam. Would you were—
So that my lord your son were not my brother—
Indeed my mother! Or were you both our mothers
I care no more for than I do for heaven,
So I were not his sister. Can’t no other
But, I your daughter, he must be my brother? Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law.
God shield you mean it not! ‘Daughter’ and ‘mother’
So strive upon your pulse. What, pale again?
My fear hath catched your fondness. Now I see
The myst‘ry of your loneliness, and find
Your salt tears’ head. Now to all sense ’tis gross:
You love my son. Invention is ashamed
Against the proclamation of thy passion
To say thou dost not. Therefore tell me true,
But tell me then ‘tis so—for look, thy cheeks
Confess it t’one to th‘other, and thine eyes
See it so grossly shown in thy behaviours
That in their kind they speak it. Only sin
And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,
That truth should be suspected. Speak, is’t so?
If it be so you have wound a goodly clew;
If it be not, forswear’t. Howe’er, I charge thee,
As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,
To tell me truly.
