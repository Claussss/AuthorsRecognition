SIR JOHN Master Brooke, I will first make bold with your money. He takes the money Next, give me your hand. He takes his hand And last, as I am a gentleman, you shall, if you will, enjoy Fordâ€™s wife. FORD O, good sir! SIR JOHN I say you shall. FORD Want no money, Sir John, you shall want none. SIR JOHN Want no Mistress Ford, Master Brooke, you shall want none. I shall be with her, I may tell you, by her own appointment. Even as you came in to me, her spokesmate, or go-between, parted from me. I say I shall be with her between ten and eleven, for at that time the jealous rascally knave her husband will be forth. Come you to me at night; you shall know how I speed.
