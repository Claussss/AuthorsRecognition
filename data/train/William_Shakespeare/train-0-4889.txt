SIR JOHN O sir! FORD Believe it, for you know it. There is money. He offers money Spend it, spend it; spend more; spend all I have; only give me so much of your time in exchange of it as to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this Fordâ€™s wife. Use your art of wooing, win her to consent to you. If any man may, you may as soon as any.
