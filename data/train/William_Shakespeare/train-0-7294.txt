No notes of sally, for the heavens, sweet brother. Begone, I say. The gods have heard me swear. The gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows.
They are polluted offâ€™rings, more abhorred
Than spotted livers in the sacrifice. ANDROMACHE (to Hector) O, be persuaded. Do not count it holy
To hurt by being just. It is as lawful,
For we would give much, to use violent thefts,
And rob in the behalf of charity.
