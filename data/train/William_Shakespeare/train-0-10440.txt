VOLUMNIA O, stand up blest, Coriolanus rises Whilst with no softer cushion than the flint
 I kneel before thee, and unproperly
 Show duty as mistaken all this while
 Between the child and parent. CORIOLANUS What’s this? Your knees to me? To your corrected son? He raises her  Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
Fillip the stars; then let the mutinous winds
Strike the proud cedars ‘gainst the fiery sun,
Murd’ring impossibility to make
What cannot be slight work.
