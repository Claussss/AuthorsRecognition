A LORD Well done, my lord. Though I am satisfied, and need no more
Than what I know, yet shall the oracle
Give rest to th’ minds of others such as he,
Whose ignorant credulity will not
Come up to th’ truth. So have we thought it good
From our free person she should be confined,
Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence
Be left her to perform. Come, follow us.
We are to speak in public; for this business
Will raise us all.
