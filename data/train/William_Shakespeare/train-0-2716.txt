KING EDWARD If gall or wormwood have a pleasant taste,
Then is thy salutation honey sweet.
But as the one hath no such property,
So is the other most satirical.
Yet wot how I regard thy worthless taunts.
If thou have uttered them to soil my fame,
Or dim the reputation of my birth,
Know that thy wolvish barking cannot hurt.
If slyly to insinuate with the world,
And with a strumpetâ€™s artificial lime
To paint thy vicious and deformed cause,
Be well assured the counterfeit will fade,
And in the end thy foul defects be seen.
But if thou didst it to provoke me on,
As who should say I were but timorous,
Or, coldly negligent, did need a spur,
Bethink thyself how slack I was at sea,
How, since my landing, I have won no towns,
Entered no further but upon the coast,
And there have ever since securely slept.
But if I have been otherwise employed,
Imagine, Valois, whether I intend
To skirmish, not for pillage, but for the crown
Which thou dost wear and that I vow to have,
Or one of us shall fall into his grave.
