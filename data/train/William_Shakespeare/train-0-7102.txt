Virgins and boys, mid-age, and wrinkled old,
Soft infancy that nothing canst but cry,
Add to my clamours. Let us pay betimes
A moiety of that mass of moan to come.
Cry, Trojans, cry! Practise your eyes with tears.

Cry, Trojans, cry! Ah Helen, and ah woe!
Cry, cry ‘Troy burns!’—or else let Helen go. Exit
