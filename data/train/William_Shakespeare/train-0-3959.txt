ROBIN On the ground sleep sound. I’ll apply to your eye,
Gentle lover, remedy.
He drops the juice on Lysander’s eyelids
When thou wak‘st thou tak’st
True delight in the sight
Of thy former lady’s eye,
And the country proverb known,
That ‘every man should take his own’,
In your waking shall be shown.
Jack shall have Jill,
Naught shall go ill,
