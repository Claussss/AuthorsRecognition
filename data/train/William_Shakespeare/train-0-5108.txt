LORD CHIEF JUSTICE I think you are fallen into the disease, for you hear not what I say to you. SIR JOHN Very well, my lord, very well. Rather, anâ€™t please you, it is the disease of not listening, the malady of not marking, that I am troubled withal. LORD CHIEF JUSTICE To punish you by the heels would amend the attention of your ears, and I care not if I do become your physician.
