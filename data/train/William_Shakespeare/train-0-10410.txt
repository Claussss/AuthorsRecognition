You’re goodly things, you voices. MENENIUS You have made good work, You and your cry. Shall’s to the Capitol? COMINIUS O, ay, what else? Exeunt Menenius and Cominius Go, masters, get you home. Be not dismayed.
These are a side that would be glad to have
This true which they so seem to fear. Go home,
And show no sign of fear.
