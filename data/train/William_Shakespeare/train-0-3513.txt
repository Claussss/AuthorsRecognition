DUCHESS OF YORK (within) What ho, my liege, for God’s sake let me in! What shrill-voiced suppliant makes this eager cry? DUCHESS OF YORK (within) A woman, and thy aunt, great King; ’tis I.
Speak with me, pity me! Open the door!
A beggar begs that never begged before. Our scene is altered from a serious thing,
And now changed to ‘The Beggar and the King’.
My dangerous cousin, let your mother in.
I know she is come to pray for your foul sin.
