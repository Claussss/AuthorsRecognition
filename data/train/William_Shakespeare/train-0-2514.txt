Yield to my hand, my hand shall conquer thee;
Thou dead, both die, and both shall victors be.’ This plot of death when sadly she had laid,
And wiped the brinish pearl from her bright eyes,
With untuned tongue she hoarsely calls her maid,
Whose swift obedience to her mistress hies;
For fleet-winged duty with thought’s feathers flies.
