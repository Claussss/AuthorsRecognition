KING EDWARD Upbraid’st thou him because within his face
Time hath engraved deep characters of age?
Know that these grave scholars of experience,
Like stiff-grown oaks, will stand immovable
When whirlwind quickly turns up younger trees. EARL OF DERBY (to the King of France) Was ever any of thy father’s house
King but thyself before this present time?
(To the French generally) Edward’s great lineage by the
mother’s side
Five hundred years hath held the sceptre up.
Judge then, conspirators, by this descent
Which is the true-born sovereign—this, or that.
