BRUTUS Let’s to the Capitol, And carry with us ears and eyes for th’ time,
But hearts for the event. SICINIUS Have with you. Exeunt 2.2

FIRST OFFICER Come, come, they are almost here. How many stand for consulships? SECOND OFFICER Three, they say, but ’tis thought of everyone Coriolanus will carry it.
