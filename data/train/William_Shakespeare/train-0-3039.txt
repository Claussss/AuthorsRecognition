What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot. So study evermore is overshot.
While it doth study to have what it would,
It doth forget to do the thing it should;
And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,
’Tis won as towns with fire—so won, so lost. We must of force dispense with this decree.
She must lie here, on mere necessity.
