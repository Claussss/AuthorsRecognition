It rested in your grace To unloose this tied-up Justice when you pleased,
And it in you more dreadful would have seemed
Than in Lord Angelo. I do fear, too dreadful. Sith ‘twas my fault to give the people scope,
’Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
For what I bid them do—for we bid this be done
When evil deeds have their permissive pass,
And not the punishment. Therefore indeed, my father,
I have on Angelo imposed the office,
Who may in th‘ambush of my name strike home,
And yet my nature never in the fight
T’allow in slander. And to behold his sway,
I will as ’twere a brother of your order
Visit both prince and people. Therefore, I prithee,
Supply me with the habit, and instruct me
How I may formally in person bear
Like a true friar. More reasons for this action
At our more leisure shall I render you.
Only this one: Lord Angelo is precise,
Stands at a guard with envy, scarce confesses
That his blood flows, or that his appetite
Is more to bread than stone. Hence shall we see
If power change purpose, what our seemers be.
