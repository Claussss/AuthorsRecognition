Say, what abridgement have you for this evening?
What masque, what music? How shall we beguile
The lazy time if not with some delight? There is a brief how many sports are ripe.
Make choice of which your highness will see first. ‘The battle with the centaurs, to be sung
By an Athenian eunuch to the harp.’
