Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh
Till I be brought to such a silly pass. Fie, what a foolish duty call you this? I would your duty were as foolish, too.
The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,
Hath cost me a hundred crowns since supper-time. The more fool you for laying on my duty. Katherine, I charge thee tell these headstrong women
What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.
