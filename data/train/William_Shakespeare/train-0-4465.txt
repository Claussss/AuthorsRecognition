Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further. Take some remembrance of us as a tribute,
Not as fee. Grant me two things, I pray you:
Not to deny me, and to pardon me. You press me far, and therefore I will yield.
To Antonio
your sake.
(To Bassanio) And for your love I’ll take this ring from
you.
Do not draw back your hand. I’ll take no more,
And you in love shall not deny me this.
