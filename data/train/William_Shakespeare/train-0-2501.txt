Sometime her grief is dumb and hath no words,
Sometime ’tis mad and too much talk affords. The little birds that tune their morning’s joy
Make her moans mad with their sweet melody,
For mirth doth search the bottom of annoy;
Sad souls are slain in merry company;
Grief best is pleased with grief’s society.
