My lord, I have considered with myself
The title of this most renowned Duke,
And in my conscience do repute his grace
The rightful heir to England’s royal seat. Hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me? SALISBURY I have. Canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath? It is great sin to swear unto a sin,
But greater sin to keep a sinful oath.
Who can be bound by any solemn vow
To do a murd’rous deed, to rob a man,
To force a spotless virgin’s chastity,
To reave the orphan of his patrimony,
To wring the widow from her customed right,
And have no other reason for this wrong
But that he was bound by a solemn oath?
