Sc. 13
Enter Sir Thomas More, his Lady, Daughters, one of them Roperâ€™s Wife,Master Roper, Gentlemen and
Servants amongst them Catesby and Goughas in his house
at Chelsea. Low stools Good morrow, good son Roper. [To Lady More] Sit, good
madam,
Upon an humble seat; the time so craves.
Rest your good heart on earth, the roof of graves.
You see the floor of greatness is uneven,
The cricket and high throne alike near heaven.
Now, daughters, you that like to branches spread
And give best shadow to a private house:
Be comforted, my girls. Your hopes stand fair.
Virtue breeds gentry; she makes the best heir.
