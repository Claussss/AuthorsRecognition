Leonard Digges, in Comedies, Histories, and Tragedies (1623) 
To the memory of Master William Shakespeare We wondered, Shakespeare, that thou went‘st so soon
From the world’s stage to the grave’s tiring-room.
We thought thee dead, but this thy printed worth
Tells thy spectators that thou went’st but forth
To enter with applause. An actor’s art
Can die, and live to act a second part.
That’s but an exit of mortality;
This, a re-entrance to a plaudite.
