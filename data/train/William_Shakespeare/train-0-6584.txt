QUEEN GERTRUDE O Hamlet, speak no more! Thou turn’st mine eyes into my very soul,
And there I see such black and grained spots
As will not leave their tinct. HAMLET Nay, but to live In the rank sweat of an enseam
Stewed in corruption, honeying and making love
Over the nasty sty— QUEEN GERTRUDE O, speak to me no more!
