Mingling my talk with tears, my grief with groans,
Poor wasting monuments of lasting moans. â€˜O night, thou furnace of foul reeking smoke,
Let not the jealous day behold that face
Which underneath thy black all-hiding cloak
Immodestly lies martyred with disgrace!
Keep still possession of thy gloomy place,
