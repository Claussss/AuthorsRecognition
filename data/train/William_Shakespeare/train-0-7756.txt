LADY MORE and DAUGHTERS O God, O God! Be patient, good madam. Ay, Downes, is’t thou? I once did save thy life,
When else by cruel riotous assault
Thou hadst been torn in pieces. Thou art reserved
To be my summ‘ner to yon spiritual court.
Give me thy hand, good fellow. Smooth thy face.
The diet that thou drink’st is spiced with mace,
And I could ne‘er abide it. ’Twill not digest,
’Twill lie too heavy, man, on my weak breast.
