Enter the Duke of Gloucester. Edmond reads a letter Kent banished thus, and France in choler parted,
And the King gone tonight, prescribed his power,
Confined to exhibition—all this done
Upon the gad?—Edmond, how now? What news? EDMOND So please your lordship, none. GLOUCESTER Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?
