Or like the deadly bullet of a gun,
His meaning struck her ere his words begun, And at his look she flatly falleth down,
For looks kill love, and love by looks reviveth;
A smile recures the wounding of a frown,
But blessed bankrupt that by loss so thriveth! The silly boy, believing she is dead,
Claps her pale cheek till clapping makes it red,
