It is the most impenetrable cur
That ever kept with men. ANTONIO Let him alone. Iâ€™ll follow him no more with bootless prayers.
He seeks my life. His reason well I know:
I oft delivered from his forfeitures
Many that have at times made moan to me.
Therefore he hates me. SOLANIO I am sure the Duke Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.
