Exeunt Abhorson
and
Pompey Enter Provost Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner? A creature unprepared, unmeet for death;
And to transport him in the mind he is
Were damnable. Here in the prison, father, There died this morning of a cruel fever
One Ragusine, a most notorious pirate,
A man of Claudioâ€™s years, his beard and head
Just of his colour. What if we do omit
This reprobate till he were well inclined,
And satisfy the deputy with the visage
Of Ragusine, more like to Claudio?
