(To Hermione) ’Tis time. Descend. Be stone no more.  Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,
I’ll fill your grave up. Stir. Nay, come away.
Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him
Dear life redeems you.
(To Leontes) You perceive she stirs. Hermione slowly descends Start not. Her actions shall be holy as
You hear my spell is lawful. Do not shun her
Until you see her die again, for then
You kill her double. Nay, present your hand.
When she was young, you wooed her. Now, in age,
Is she become the suitor?
