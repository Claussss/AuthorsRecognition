Error in learn Sc. 11
Enter the Lady More, her two Daughters, [one of them Roper’s Wife,] and Master Roper, as walking Madam, what ails ye for to look so sad? Troth, son, I know not what. I am not sick,
And yet I am not well. I would be merry,
But somewhat lies so heavy on my heart
I cannot choose but sigh. You are a scholar.
I pray ye tell me, may one credit dreams?
