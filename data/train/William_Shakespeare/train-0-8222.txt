OTHELLO What is the matter here? ’Swounds, I bleed still. I am hurt to th’ death.
(Attacking Cassio) He dies. OTHELLO Hold, for your lives! Hold, ho, lieutenant, sir, Montano, gentlemen!
Have you forgot all place of sense and duty?
Hold, the general speaks to you. Hold, hold, for shame. Why, how now, ho? From whence ariseth this?
Are we turned Turks, and to ourselves do that
Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?
For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl.
He that stirs next to carve for his own rage
Holds his soul light. He dies upon his motion.
Silence that dreadful belt—it frights the isle
From her propriety.
