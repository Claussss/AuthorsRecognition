Look how he can, she cannot choose but love;
And by her fair immortal hand she swears
From his soft bosom never to remove
Till he take truce with her contending tears, Which long have rained, making her cheeks all wet;
And one sweet kiss shall pay this countless debt. Upon this promise did he raise his chin,
Like a divedapper peering through a wave
Who, being looked on, ducks as quickly inâ€”
So offers he to give what she did crave.
