Exeunt the Duke of York and the Queen. Bushy, Bagot, and Green remain The wind sits fair for news to go for Ireland,
But none returns. For us to levy power
Proportionable to the enemy
Is all unpossible. Besides, our nearness to the King in love
Is near the hate of those love not the King. And that is the wavering commons; for their love
Lies in their purses, and whoso empties them
By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate.
