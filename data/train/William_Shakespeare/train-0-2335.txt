So she at these sad signs draws up her breath,
And, sighing it again, exclaims on death. ‘Hard-favoured tyrant, ugly, meagre, lean,
Hateful divorce of love’—thus chides she death;
‘Grim-grinning ghost, earth’s worm: what dost thou mean
To stifle beauty, and to steal his breath Who, when he lived, his breath and beauty set
Gloss on the rose, smell to the violet?
