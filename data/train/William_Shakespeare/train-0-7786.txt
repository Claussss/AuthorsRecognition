ROPERâ€™S WIFE Father, his majesty, upon your meek submission,
Will yet, they say, receive you to his grace,
In as great credit as you were before. ( ) wench. Faith, my lord the King
Has appointed me to do a little business.
If that were past, my girl, thou then shouldst see
What I would say to him about that matter.
But I shall be so busy until then
I shall not tend it.
