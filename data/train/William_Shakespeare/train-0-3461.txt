BISHOP OF CARLISLE That honourable day shall never be seen.
Many a time hath banished Norfolk fought
For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field,
Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross
Against black pagans, Turks, and Saracens;
And, toiled with works of war, retired himself
To Italy, and there at Venice gave
His body to that pleasant countryâ€™s earth,
And his pure soul unto his captain, Christ,
Under whose colours he had fought so long.
