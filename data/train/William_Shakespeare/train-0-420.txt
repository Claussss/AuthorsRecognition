FIRST HUNTSMAN My lord, I warrant you we will play our part
As he shall think by our true diligence
He is no less than what we say he is. Take him up gently, and to bed with him;
And each one to his office when he wakes. Servingmen carry Sly out Trumpets sound Sirrah, go see what trumpet â€™tis that sounds.
