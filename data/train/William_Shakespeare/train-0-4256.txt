The Dauphin is preparing hitherward,
Where God He knows how we shall answer him;
For in a night the best part of my power,
As I upon advantage did remove,
Were in the Washes all unwarily
Devoured by the unexpected flood. King John dies You breathe these dead news in as dead an ear.
(To King John) My liege, my lord!â€”But now a king,
now thus.
