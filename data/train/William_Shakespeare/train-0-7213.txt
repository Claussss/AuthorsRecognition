Walk into her house.
I’ll bring her to the Grecian presently—
And to his hand when I deliver her,
Think it an altar, and thy brother Troilus
A priest, there off’ring to it his own heart. PARIS I know what ’tis to love, And would, as I shall pity, I could help.—
Please you walk in, my lords? Exeunt  4.5
Enter Pandarus and Cressida
