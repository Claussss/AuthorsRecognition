It shall not need. Thy father hath his life. Sir, I must have that diamond from you. ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS There, take it, and much thanks for my good cheer. Renowned Duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
To go with us into the abbey here,
And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes,
And all that are assembled in this place,
That by this sympathized one day’s error
Have suffered wrong. Go, keep us company,
And we shall make full satisfaction.
Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail
Of you, my sons, and till this present hour
My heavy burden ne’er delivered.
The Duke, my husband, and my children both,
And you the calendars of their nativity,
Go to a gossips’ feast, and joy with me.
After so long grief, such festivity!
