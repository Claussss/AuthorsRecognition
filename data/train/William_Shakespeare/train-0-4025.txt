But all the story of the night told over,
And all their minds transfigured so together,
More witnesseth than fancyâ€™s images, 15
And grows to something of great constancy;
But howsoever, strange and admirable. Enter the lovers: Lysander, Demetrius, Hermia, and Helena Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.
Come now, what masques, what dances shall we
have
To ease the anguish of a torturing hour? 20
