Who, having two sweet babes, when death takes one
Will slay the other and be nurse to none. â€˜My body or my soul, which was the dearer,
When the one pure the other made divine?
Whose love of either to myself was nearer,
When both were kept for heaven and Collatine?
Ay me, the bark peeled from the lofty pine
