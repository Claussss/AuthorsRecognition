EDGAR Ay, master. There is a cliff whose high and bending head
Looks fearfully in the confined deep.
Bring me but to the very brim of it
And Iâ€™ll repair the misery thou dost bear
With something rich about me. From that place
I shall no leading need. EDGAR Give me thy arm. Poor Tom shall lead thee. Exit Edgar guiding Gloucester
