What, are you busy, ho? Need you my help? No, madam, we have culled such necessaries
As are behoveful for our state tomorrow.
So please you, let me now be left alone,
And let the Nurse this night sit up with you,
For I am sure you have your hands full all
In this so sudden business. CAPULETâ€™S WIFE Good night.
