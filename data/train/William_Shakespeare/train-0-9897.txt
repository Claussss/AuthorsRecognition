PERICLES I do not doubt thy faith, But should he in my absence wrong thy liberties? We’ll mingle our bloods together in the earth
From whence we had our being and our birth. Tyre, I now look from thee then, and to Tarsus
Intend my travel, where I’ll hear from thee,
And by whose letters I’ll dispose myself.
The care I had and have of subjects’ good
On thee I lay, whose wisdom’s strength can bear it.
I’ll take thy word for faith, not ask thine oath;
Who shuns not to break one will sure crack both.
But in our orbs we’ll live so round and safe
That time of both this truth shall ne’er convince:
Thou showed’st a subject’s shine, I a true prince.
