Enter a Messenger O, from Italy.
Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,
That long time have been barren. Madam, madam! Antonio’s dead. If thou say so, villain,
Thou kill’st thy mistress; but well and free,
If thou so yield him, there is gold, and here
My bluest veins to kiss—a hand that kings
Have lipped, and trembled kissing.
