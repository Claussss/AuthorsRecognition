For lovers say the heart hath treble wrong
When it is barred the aidance of the tongue. An oven that is stopped, or river stayed,
Burneth more hotly, swelleth with more rage.
So of concealed sorrow may be said
Free vent of words love’s fire doth assuage. But when the heart’s attorney once is mute,
The client breaks, as desperate in his suit.
