REYNALDO May it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to you? Of her I am to speak. COUNTESS (to Lavatch) Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her. Helen, I mean. LAVATCH sings ‘Was this fair face the cause’, quoth she,
‘Why the Grecians sacked Troy?
Fond done, done fond. Was this King Priam’s joy?’
With that she sighed as she stood,
With that she sighed as she stood,
And gave this sentence then:
‘Among nine bad if one be good,
Among nine bad if one be good,
There’s yet one good in ten.’
