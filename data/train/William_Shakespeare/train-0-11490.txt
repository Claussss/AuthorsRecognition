I have no hope That he’s undrowned. O, out of that ‘no hope’ What great hope have you! No hope that way is
Another way so high a hope that even
Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,
But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me
That Ferdinand is drowned? Then tell me, Who’s the next heir of Naples?
