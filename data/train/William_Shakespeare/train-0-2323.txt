So did the merciless and pitchy night
Fold in the object that did feed her sight. Whereat amazed, as one that unaware
Hath dropped a precious jewel in the flood,
Or stonished, as night wandâ€™rers often are,
Their light blown out in some mistrustful wood: Even so, confounded in the dark she lay,
Having lost the fair discovery of her way.
