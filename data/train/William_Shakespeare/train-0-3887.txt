Enter Lysander and Hermia Fair love, you faint with wand’ring in the wood,
And, to speak truth, I have forgot our way.
We’ll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good,
And tarry for the comfort of the day. Be it so, Lysander. Find you out a bed;
For I upon this bank will rest my head. She lies down One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;
One heart, one bed; two bosoms, and one troth.
