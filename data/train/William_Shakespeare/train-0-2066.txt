3.7
Enter Richard Duke of Gloucester at one door and the Duke of Buckingham at another 
RICHARD GLOUCESTER How now, how now! What say the citizens? Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,
The citizens are mum, say not a word. RICHARD GLOUCESTER Touched you the bastardy of Edward’s children? I did, with his contract with Lady Lucy,
And his contract by deputy in France,
Th‘insatiate greediness of his desire,
And his enforcement of the city wives,
His tyranny for trifles, his own bastardy—
As being got your father then in France,
And his resemblance, being not like the Duke.
Withal, I did infer your lineaments—
Being the right idea of your father
Both in your face and nobleness of mind;
Laid open all your victories in Scotland,
Your discipline in war, wisdom in peace,
Your bounty, virtue, fair humility—
Indeed, left nothing fitting for your purpose
Untouched or slightly handled in discourse.
And when mine oratory grew toward end,
I bid them that did love their country’s good
Cry ‘God save Richard, England’s royal king!’
