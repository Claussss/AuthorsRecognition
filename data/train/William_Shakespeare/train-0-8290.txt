IAGO Yet be content. O, blood, blood, blood! IAGO Patience, I say. Your mind may change. Never, Iago. Like to the Pontic Sea,
Whose icy current and compulsive course
Ne‘er knows retiring ebb, but keeps due on
To the Propontic and the Hellespont,
Even so my bloody thoughts with violent pace
Shall ne’er look back, ne’er ebb to humble love,
Till that a capable and wide revenge
Swallow them up.
