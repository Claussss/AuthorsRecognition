‘Such devils steal effects from lightless hell,
For Sinon in his fire doth quake with cold,
And in that cold hot-burning fire doth dwell.
These contraries such unity do hold
Only to flatter fools and make them bold; So Priam’s trust false Sinon’s tears doth flatter
That he finds means to burn his Troy with water.’
