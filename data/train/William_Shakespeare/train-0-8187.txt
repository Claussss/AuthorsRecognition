See for the news. Exit Gentleman Good ensign, you are welcome. (Kissing Emilia)
Welcome, mistress.
Let it not gall your patience, good Iago,
That I extend my manners. â€™Tis my breeding
That gives me this bold show of courtesy. Sir, would she give you so much of her lips
As of her tongue she oft bestows on me,
You would have enough.
