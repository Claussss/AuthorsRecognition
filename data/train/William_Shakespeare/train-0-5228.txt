BARDOLPH My captain, sir, commends him to youâ€”my captain Sir John Falstaff, a tall gentleman, by heaven, and a most gallant leader. SHALLOW He greets me well, sir. I knew him a good backsword man. How doth the good knight? May I ask how my lady his wife doth? BARDOLPH Sir, pardon, a soldier is better accommodated than with a wife.
