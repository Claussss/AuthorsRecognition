Sir, I confess I have been much misgoverned,
And led by idle spleens, which now I see
Are, like themselves, mere sottish vanity.
When in the jail, I better called to mind
The grave rebukes of my Lord Chancellor,
And looked into myself with more respect
Than my rash heat before would let me see.
I caused a barber presently be sent for,
And moved your worship then to speak for me.
But when I fall into like folly again
Cashier me < )
