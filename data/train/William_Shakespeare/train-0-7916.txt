Yet show some pity. I show it most of all when I show justice,
For then I pity those I do not know
Which a dismissed offence would after gall,
And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,
Lives not to act another. Be satisfied.
Your brother dies tomorrow. Be content. So you must be the first that gives this sentence,
And he that suffers. O, it is excellent
To have a giantâ€™s strength, but it is tyrannous
To use it like a giant.
