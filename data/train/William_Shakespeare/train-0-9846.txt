DIANA (to the King) He does me wrong, my lord. If I were so
He might have bought me at a common price.
Do not believe him. O behold this ring,
Whose high respect and rich validity
Did lack a parallel; yet for all that
He gave it to a commoner o’th’ camp,
If I be one. He blushes and ’tis hit. Of six preceding ancestors, that gem;
Conferred by testament to th’ sequent issue
Hath it been owed and worn. This is his wife.
That ring’s a thousand proofs.
