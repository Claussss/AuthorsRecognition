O princely Buckingham, Iâ€™ll kiss thy hand
In sign of league and amity with thee.
Now fair befall thee and thy noble house!
Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,
Nor thou within the compass of my curse. Nor no one here, for curses never pass
The lips of those that breathe them in the air. QUEEN MARGARET
