RICHARD DUKE OF YORK This argues what her kind of life hath beenâ€”
Wicked and vile; and so her death concludes. Fie, Joan, that thou wilt be so obstacle.
God knows thou art a collop of my flesh,
And for thy sake have I shed many a tear.
Deny me not, I prithee, gentle Joan. Peasant, avaunt! (To the English) You have suborned
this man
Of purpose to obscure my noble birth.
