O husband, hear me ! Ay, alack, how new
Is ‘husband’ in my mouth! Even for that name
Which till this time my tongue did ne’er pronounce,
Upon my knee I beg, go not to arms
Against mine uncle. CONSTANCE (kneeling) O, upon my knee 235 Made hard with kneeling, I do pray to thee,
Thou virtuous Dauphin, alter not the doom
Forethought by heaven.
