This is the Duke a-hunting, as I told you.
If we be found, we are wretched. O, retire,
For honour’s sake, and safely, presently,
Into your bush again. Sir, we shall find
Too many hours to die. In, gentle cousin—
If you be seen, you perish instantly
For breaking prison, and I, if you reveal me,
For my contempt. Then all the world will scorn us,
And say we had a noble difference,
But base disposers of it.
