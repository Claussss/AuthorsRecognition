A pillow for his head.
To Marina and others
If this but answer to my just belief
I’ll well remember you. So leave him all. Exeunt all but Pericles Diana descends from the heavens My temple stands in Ephesus. Hie thee thither,
And do upon mine altar sacrifice.
There when my maiden priests are met together,
At large discourse thy fortunes in this wise:
With a full voice before the people all,
Reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife.
To mourn thy crosses, with thy daughter‘s, call
And give them repetition to the life.
Perform my bidding, or thou liv’st in woe;
Do’t, and rest happy, by my silver bow.
Awake, and tell thy dream.
