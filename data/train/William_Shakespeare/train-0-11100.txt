Senseless linen, happier therein than I!
And that was all? No, madam. For so long As he could make me with this eye or ear
Distinguish him from others he did keep
The deck, with glove or hat or handkerchief
Still waving, as the fits and stirs of â€™s mind
Could best express how slow his soul sailed on,
How swift his ship.
