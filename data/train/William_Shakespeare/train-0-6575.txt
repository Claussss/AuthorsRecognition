He sheathes his sword  Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hint.
When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,
Or in th‘incestuous pleasure of his bed,
At gaming, swearing, or about some act
That has no relish of salvation in’t,
Then trip him that his heels may kick at heaven,
And that his soul may be as damned and black
As hell whereto it goes. My mother stays.
This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.
