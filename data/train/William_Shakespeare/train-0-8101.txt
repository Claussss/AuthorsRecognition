LUCIO Faith, my lord, I spoke it but according to the trick. If you will hang me for it, you may; but I had rather it would please you I might be whipped. DUKE Whipped first, sir, and hanged after. Proclaim it, Provost, round about the city,
If any woman wronged by this lewd fellow,
As I have heard him swear himself thereâ€™s one
Whom he begot with child, let her appear,
And he shall marry her. The nuptial finished,
Let him be whipped and hanged.
