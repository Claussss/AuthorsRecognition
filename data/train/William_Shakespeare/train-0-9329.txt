Will’t please you hear me? I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak’st.
Yet if thou say Antony lives, is well,
Or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him,
I’ll set thee in a shower of gold, and hail
Rich pearls upon thee. Madam, he’s well. And friends with Caesar. CLEOPATRA Thou’rt an honest man.
