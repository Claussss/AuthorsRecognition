LANCELOT I will go before, sir. (Aside to Jessica)
Mistress, look out at window for all this.
There will come a Christian by
Will be worth a Jew SHYLOCK (to Jessica) What says that fool of Hagar’s offspring, ha? His words were ‘Farewell, mistress’; nothing else. The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder,
Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day
More than the wildcat. Drones hive not with me;
Therefore I part with him, and part with him
To one that I would have him help to waste
His borrowed purse. Well, Jessica, go in.
Perhaps I will return immediately.
Do as I bid you. Shut doors after you.
Fast bind, fast find—
A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.
