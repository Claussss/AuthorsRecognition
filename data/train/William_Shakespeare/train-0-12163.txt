Were they metamorphosed
 Both into one! O why? There were no woman
Worth so composed a man: their single share,
Their nobleness peculiar to them, gives
The prejudice of disparity, value’s shortness,
To any lady breathing— Cornetts. Cry within, ‘Arcite, Arcite’ More exulting? ‘Palamon’ still? Nay, now the sound is ‘Arcite’.
