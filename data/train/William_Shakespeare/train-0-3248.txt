Most true, â€™tis right, you were so, Alisander. BIRON (to Costard) Pompey the Great. COSTARD Your servant, and Costard. BIRON Take away the conqueror, take away Alisander. COSTARD (to Nathaniel) O, sir, you have overthrown Alisander the Conqueror. You will be scraped out of the painted cloth for this. Your lion that holds his poleaxe sitting on a close-stool will be given to Ajax. He will be the ninth Worthy. A conqueror and afeard to speak? Run away for shame, Alisander.
