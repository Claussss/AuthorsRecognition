Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
Shalt with him hence. ROMEO This shall determine that. They fight. Tybalt is wounded. He falls and dies BENVOLIO Romeo, away, be gone. The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
Stand not amazed. The Prince will doom thee death
If thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away.
