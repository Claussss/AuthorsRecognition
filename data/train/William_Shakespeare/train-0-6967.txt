I am gone, sir,
And anon, sir,
I’ll be with you again,
In a trice,
Like to the old Vice,
Your need to sustain,
Who with dagger of lath
In his rage and his wrath
Cries ‘Aha,’ to the devil,
Like a mad lad,
‘Pare thy nails, dad,
Adieu, goodman devil.’ Exit 
 4.3
Enter Sebastian This is the air, that is the glorious sun.
This pearl she gave me, I do feel’t and see‘t,
And though ’tis wonder that enwraps me thus,
Yet ‘tis not madness. Where’s Antonio then?
I could not find him at the Elephant,
Yet there he was, and there I found this credit,
That he did range the town to seek me out.
His counsel now might do me golden service,
For though my soul disputes well with my sense
That this may be some error but no madness,
Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune
So far exceed all instance, all discourse,
That I am ready to distrust mine eyes
And wrangle with my reason that persuades me
To any other trust but that I am mad,
Or else the lady’s mad. Yet if ’twere so
She could not sway her house, command her
followers,
Take and give back affairs and their dispatch
With such a smooth, discreet, and stable bearing
As I perceive she does. There’s something in’t
That is deceivable. But here the lady comes.
