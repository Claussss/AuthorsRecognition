Her azure veins, her alabaster skin,
Her coral lips, her snow-white dimpled chin. As the grim lion fawneth o‘er his prey,
Sharp hunger by the conquest satisfied,
So o’er this sleeping soul doth Tarquin stay,
His rage of lust by gazing qualified,
Slaked not suppressed for standing by her side. His eye which late this mutiny restrains
Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins,
