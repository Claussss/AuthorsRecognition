DUCHESS OF YORK Thy life answer? Bring me my boots. I will unto the King. His man enters with his boots DUCHESS OF YORK Strike him, Aumerle! Poor boy, thou art amazed.
(To York’s man) Hence, villain! Never more come in my sight. Give me my boots, I say. DUCHESS OF YORK Why, York, what wilt thou do? Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own?
Have we more sons? Or are we like to have?
Is not my teeming date drunk up with time?
And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age,
And rob me of a happy mother’s name?
Is he not like thee? Is he not thine own?
