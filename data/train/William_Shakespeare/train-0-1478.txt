And there will we be, too, ere it be long,
Or else reproach be Talbot’s greatest fame.
Vow Burgundy, by honour of thy house,
Pricked on by public wrongs sustained in France,
Either to get the town again or die.
And I—as sure as English Henry lives,
And as his father here was conqueror;
As sure as in this late betrayed town
Great Cceur-de-lion
So sure I swear to get the town or die.
