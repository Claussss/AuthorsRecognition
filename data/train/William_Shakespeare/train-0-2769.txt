Enter
a Herald from Jean King of France What tidings, messenger? Be plain and brief. The King of France, my sovereign lord and master,
Greets by me his foe, the Prince of Wales.
If thou call forth a hundred men of name—
Of lords, knights, squires and English gentlemen—
And with thyself and those, kneel at his feet,
He straight will fold his bloody colours up
And ransom shall redeem lives forfeited.
If not, this day shall drink more English blood
Than e’er was buried in our British earth.
What is thy answer to his proffered mercy?
