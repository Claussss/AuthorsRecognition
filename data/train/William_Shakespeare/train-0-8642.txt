REGAN Out, villain! Thou call’st on him that hates thee. It was he
That made the overture of thy treasons to us,
Who is too good to pity thee. O, my follies! Then Edgar was abused.
Kind gods, forgive me that, and prosper him! REGAN (to Servants) Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell
His way to Dover. (To Cornwall) How is’t, my lord?
How look you?
