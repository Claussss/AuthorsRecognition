Hear us, great Kings, vouchsafe a while to stay,
And I shall show you peace and fair-faced league.
Win you this city without stroke or wound;
Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds, 420
That here come sacrifices for the field.
Persever not, but hear me, mighty Kings. Speak on with favour; we are bent to hear.
