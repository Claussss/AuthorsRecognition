Lodowick comes forward
Give me ink and paper. LODOWICK I will, my liege. KING EDWARD And bid the lords hold on their play at chess,
For we will walk and meditate alone. LODOWICK I will, my sovereign. Exit KING EDWARD This fellow is well read in poetry,
And hath a lusty and persuasive spirit.
I will acquaint him with my passion,
Which he shall shadow with a veil of lawn,
Through which the queen of beautyâ€™s queen shall see
Herself the ground of my infirmity.
