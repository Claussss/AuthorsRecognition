O, Prince, thy sweet bemoaning speech to me
Is as a mournful knell to one dead sick. PRINCE OF WALES (embracing him) Dear Audley, if my tongue ring out thy end
My arms shall be thy grave. What may I do
To win thy life or to revenge thy death?
If thou wilt drink the blood of captive kings,
Or that it were restorative, command
A health of king’s blood, and I’ll drink to thee.
If honour may dispense for thee with death,
The never-dying honour of this day
Share wholly, Audley, to thyself, and live.
