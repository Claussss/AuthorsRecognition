PORTIA (aside) How all the other passions fleet to air,
As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embraced despair,
And shuddâ€™ring fear, and green-eyed jealousy. 110
O love, be moderate! Allay thy ecstasy.
In measure rain thy joy; scant this excess.
I feel too much thy blessing: make it less,
For fear I surfeit.
