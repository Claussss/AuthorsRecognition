A GOTH What says our general? Aemilius, let the Emperor give his pledges
Unto my father and my uncle Marcus,
And we will come. Away! Flourish.marching 5.2
Enter Tamora and Chiron and Demetrius, her two sons, disguised Thus, in this strange and sad habiliment,
I will encounter with Andronicus
And say I am Revenge, sent from below
To join with him and right his heinous wrongs.
Knock at his study, where they say he keeps
To ruminate strange plots of dire revenge.
Tell him Revenge is come to join with him
And work confusion on his enemies.
