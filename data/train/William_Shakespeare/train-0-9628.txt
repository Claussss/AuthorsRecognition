BERTRAM And I will do so. PAROLES Worthy fellows, and like to prove most sinewy sword-men. Exeunt [Bertram and Paroles] Enter Lafeu to the King LAFEU (kneeling) Pardon, my lord, for me and for my tidings. KING I’ll fee thee to stand up. LAFEU (rising) Then here’s a man stands that has bought his pardon.
I would you had kneeled, my lord, to ask me mercy,
And that at my bidding you could so stand up.
