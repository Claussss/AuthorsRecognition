And coal-black clouds, that shadow heaven’s light,
Do summon us to part and bid good night. ‘Now let me say good night, and so say you.
If you will say so, you shall have a kiss.’
‘Good night,’ quoth she; and ere he says adieu
The honey fee of parting tendered is. Her arms do lend his neck a sweet embrace.
Incorporate then they seem; face grows to face,
