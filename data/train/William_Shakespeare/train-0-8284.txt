IAGO My noble lord. If thou dost slander her and torture me,
Never pray more; abandon all remorse,
On horror’s head horrors accumulate,
Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed,
For nothing canst thou to damnation add
Greater than that. IAGO O grace, O heaven forgive me! Are you a man? Have you a soul or sense?
God buy you, take mine office. O wretched fool,
That lov’st to make thine honesty a vice!
O monstrous world, take note, take note, O world,
To be direct and honest is not safe!
I thank you for this profit, and from hence
I’ll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence.
