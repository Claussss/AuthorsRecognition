SICINIUS For that he has, As much as in him lies, from time to time
Inveighed against the people, seeking means
To pluck away their power, as now at last
Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence
Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers
That doth distribute it, in the name o‘th’ people,
And in the power of us the tribunes, we
E’en from this instant banish him our city
In peril of precipitation
From off the rock Tarpeian, never more
To enter our Rome gates. I’th’ people’s name
I say it shall be so.
ALL 
It shall be so. Let him away. He’s banished,
And it shall be so.
