Now, my good lords of Salisbury and Warwick,
Our simple supper ended, give me leave
In this close walk to satisfy myself
In craving your opinion of my title,
Which is infallible, to Englandâ€™s crown. My lord, I long to hear it out at full. Sweet York, begin, and if thy claim be good,
The Nevilles are thy subjects to command.
