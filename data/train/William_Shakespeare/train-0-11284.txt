Well, ’tis done. We’ll hunt no more today, nor seek for danger
Where there’s no profit. I prithee, to our rock.
You and Fidele play the cooks. I’ll stay
Till hasty Polydore return, and bring him
To dinner presently. Poor sick Fidele! I’ll willingly to him. To gain his colour
I’d let a parish of such Clotens blood,
And praise myself for charity.
