THALIART (aside) Well, I perceive I shall not be hanged now,
Although I would.
But since he’s gone, the King’s ears it must please
He scaped the land to perish on the seas.
I’ll present myself.—Peace to the lords of Tyre.
Lord Thaliart am I, of Antioch. Lord Thaliart of Antioch is welcome. From King Antiochus I come
With message unto princely Pericles,
But since my landing I have understood
Your lord’s betook himself to unknown travels.
Now my message must return from whence it came.
