PAGE Sir Hugh is there, is he? HOST He is there. See what humour he is in, and I will bring the Doctor about by the fields. Will it do well? SHALLOW We will do it. Exeunt Page, Shallow, and Slender CAIUS drawing his rapier HOST Let him die. Sheathe thy impatience; throw cold water on thy choler. Go about the fields with me through Frogmore. I will bring thee where Mistress Anne Page is, at a farmhouse a-feasting; and thou shalt woo her. Cried game? Said I well?
