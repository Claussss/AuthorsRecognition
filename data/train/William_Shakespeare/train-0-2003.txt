PRINCE EDWARD No, uncle, but our crosses on the way
Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy.
I want more uncles here to welcome me. RICHARD GLOUCESTER Sweet Prince, the untainted virtue of your years
Hath not yet dived into the worldâ€™s deceit,
Nor more can you distinguish of a man
Than of his outward show, which God he knows
Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.
Those uncles which you want were dangerous.
Your grace attended to their sugared words,
But looked not on the poison of their hearts.
God keep you from them, and from such false friends.
