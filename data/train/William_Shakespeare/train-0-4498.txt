Then you shall be his surety. Give him this,
And bid him keep it better than the other. Here, Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring. By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor! I had it of him. Pardon me, Bassanio,
For by this ring, the doctor lay with me. And pardon me, my gentle Graziano,
For that same scrubbed boy, the doctorâ€™s clerk,
In lieu of this last night did lie with me.
