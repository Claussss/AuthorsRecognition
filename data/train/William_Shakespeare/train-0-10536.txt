Shall I be heard? Who is’t that goes with me? Beseech your highness
My women may be with me, for you see
My plight requires it.—Do not weep, good fools,
There is no cause. When you shall know your
mistress
Has deserved prison, then abound in tears
As I come out. This action I now go on
Is for my better grace.—Adieu, my lord.
I never wished to see you sorry; now
I trust I shall. My women, come, you have leave.
