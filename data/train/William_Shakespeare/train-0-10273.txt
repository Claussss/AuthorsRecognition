Why either were you ignorant to see’t,
Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness
To yield your voices? BRUTUS (to the Citizens) Could you not have told him As you were lessoned: when he had no power
But was a petty servant to the state,
He was your enemy, ever spake against
Your liberties and the charters that you bear
I‘th’ body of the weal; and now arriving
A place of potency and sway o’th’ state,
If he should still malignantly remain
Fast foe to th’ plebeii, your voices might
Be curses to yourselves. You should have said
That as his worthy deeds did claim no less
Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature
Would think upon you for your voices and
Translate his malice towards you into love,
Standing your friendly lord.
