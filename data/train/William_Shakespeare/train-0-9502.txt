I would not see’t. Come then; for with a wound I must be cured.
Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn
Most useful for thy country. O sir, pardon me! 80 When I did make thee free, swor’st thou not then
To do this when I bade thee? Do it at once,
Or thy precedent services are all
But accidents unpurposed. Draw, and come.
