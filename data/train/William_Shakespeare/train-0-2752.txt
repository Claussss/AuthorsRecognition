Enter Lord Percy Lord Percy, welcome. What’s the news in England? The Queen, my lord, commends her to your grace,
And from her highness and the lord vicegerent
I bring this happy tidings of success:
David of Scotland, lately up in arms,
Thinking belike he soonest should prevail—
Your highness being absent from the realm—
Is by the fruitful service of your peers
And painful travail of the Queen herself—
That, big with child, was every day in arms—
Vanquished, subdued and taken prisoner.
