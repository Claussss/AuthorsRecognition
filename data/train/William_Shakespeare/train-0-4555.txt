Nay, if you have not, to’t again. We’ll stay your leisure. HOTSPUR I have done, i’faith. Then once more to your Scottish prisoners. Deliver them up without their ransom straight;
And make the Douglas’ son your only mean
For powers in Scotland, which, for divers reasons
Which I shall send you written, be assured
Will easily be granted. (To Northumberland) You, my
lord,
Your son in Scotland being thus employed,
Shall secretly into the bosom creep
Of that same noble prelate well-beloved,
The Archbishop.
