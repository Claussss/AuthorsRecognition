ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Justice, most gracious Duke, O grant me justice,
Even for the service that long since I did thee,
When I bestrid thee in the wars, and took
Deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood
That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice! EGEON (aside) Unless the fear of death doth make me dote,
I see my son Antipholus, and Dromio.
