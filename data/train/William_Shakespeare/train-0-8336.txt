OTHELLO With mine officer. IAGO That’s fouler. OTHELLO Get me some poison, Iago, this night. I’ll not expostulate with her, lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again. This night, Iago. IAGO Do it not with poison. Strangle her in her bed, even the bed she hath contaminated. OTHELLO Good, good, the justice of it pleases, very good.
