MACDUFF (to Malcolm) Hail, King, for so thou art. Behold where stands
Th’usurper’s cursed head. The time is free.
I see thee compassed with thy kingdom’s pearl,
That speak my salutation in their minds,
Whose voices I desire aloud with mine:
Hail, King of Scotland! ALL BUT MALCOLM Hail, King of Scotland!
