ARCHBISHOP OF YORK ’Tis very true, Lord Bardolph, for indeed
It was young Hotspur’s case at Shrewsbury. LORD BARDOLPH It was, my lord; who lined himself with hope,
Eating the air on promise of supply,
Flatt’ring himself with project of a power
Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts;
And so, with great imagination
Proper to madmen, led his powers to death,
And winking leapt into destruction.
