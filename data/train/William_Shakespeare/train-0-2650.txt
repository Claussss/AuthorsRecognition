KING EDWARD It is thy beauty that I would enjoy. COUNTESS OF SALISBURY O, were it painted I would wipe it off
And dispossess myself to give it thee!
But, sovereign, it is soldered to my life:
Take one, and both, for, like an humble shadow,
It haunts the sunshine of my summer’s life— KING EDWARD But thou mayst lend it me to sport withal.
