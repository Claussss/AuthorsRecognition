Exeunt severally 1.4
Enter the Earl of Kent, disguised If but as well I other accents borrow
That can my speech diffuse, my good intent
May carry through itself to that full issue
For which I razed my likeness. Now, banished Kent,
If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemned,
So may it come thy master, whom thou lovâ€™st,
Shall find thee full of labours.
