They embrace KING EDWARD Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this league
With thy embracements to my wifeâ€™s allies,
And make me happy in your unity. BUCKINGHAM (to Elizabeth) Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate
Upon your grace, but with all duteous love
Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me
With hate in those where I expect most love.
When I have most need to employ a friend,
And most assured that he is a friend,
Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile
Be he unto me. This do I beg of heaven,
When I am cold in love to you or yours.
