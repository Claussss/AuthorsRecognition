They have said their prayers, and they stay for death. Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits
And give their fasting horses provender,
And after fight with them? I stay but for my guidon. To the field!
I will the banner from a trumpet take
And use it for my haste. Come, come away!
The sun is high, and we outwear the day. Exeunt
