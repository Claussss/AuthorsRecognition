Away, get thee away, good friend, be gone.
Thy comforts can do me no good at all;
Thee they may hurt. You cannot see your way. I have no way, and therefore want no eyes.
I stumbled when I saw. Full oft ’tis seen
Our means secure us, and our mere defects
Prove our commodities. O dear son Edgar,
The food of thy abused father’s wrath-
Might I but live to see thee in my touch
I’d say I had eyes again.
