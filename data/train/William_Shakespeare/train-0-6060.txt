The name of Cassius honours this corruption,
And chastisement doth therefore hide his head. CASSIUS Chastisement? Remember March, the ides of March, remember.
Did not great Julius bleed for justiceâ€™ sake?
What villain touched his body, that did stab,
And not for justice? What, shall one of us,
That struck the foremost man of all this world
But for supporting robbers, shall we now
Contaminate our fingers with base bribes,
And sell the mighty space of our large honours
For so much trash as may be grasped thus?
I had rather be a dog and bay the moon
Than such a Roman.
