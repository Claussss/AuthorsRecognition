CASSIUS Brutus, bay not me. Iâ€™ll not endure it. You forget yourself
To hedge me in. I am a soldier, I,
Older in practice, abler than yourself
To make conditions. BRUTUS Go to, you are not, Cassius. CASSIUS I am. BRUTUS I say you are not. Urge me no more, I shall forget myself.
Have mind upon your health. Tempt me no farther.
