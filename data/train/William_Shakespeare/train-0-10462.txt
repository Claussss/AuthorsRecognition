Sir, I cannot tell. We must proceed as we do find the people. THIRD CONSPIRATOR The people will remain uncertain whilst
’Twixt you there’s difference, but the fall of either
Makes the survivor heir of all. And my pretext to strike at him admits
A good construction. I raised him, and I pawned
Mine honour for his truth; who being so heightened,
He watered his new plants with dews of flattery,
Seducing so my friends; and to this end
He bowed his nature, never known before
But to be rough, unswayable, and free.
