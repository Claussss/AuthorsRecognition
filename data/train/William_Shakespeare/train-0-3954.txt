To plainer ground. Exit Lysander Enter Demetrius DEMETRIUS shifting place Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?
Speak! In some bush? Where dost thou hide thy head? ROBIN shifting place Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars,
Telling the bushes that thou look’st for wars,
And wilt not come? Come, recreant; come, thou child,
I’ll whip thee with a rod. He is defiled
That draws a sword on thee.
