MALVOLIO I’ll be revenged on the whole pack of you. Exit He hath been most notoriously abused. Pursue him, and entreat him to a peace.
He hath not told us of the captain yet. Exit one or more When that is known, and golden time convents,
A solemn combination shall be made
Of our dear souls. Meantime, sweet sister,

But when in other habits you are seen,
Orsino’s mistress, and his fancy’s queen.
