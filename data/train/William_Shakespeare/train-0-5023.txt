MISTRESS PAGE Go, Mistress Ford, Send quickly to Sir John, to know his mind. Exit Mistress Ford Iâ€™ll to the Doctor. He hath my good will,
And none but he, to marry with Nan Page.
That Slender, though well landed, is an idiot;
And he my husband best of all affects.
The Doctor is well moneyed, and his friends
Potent at court. He, none but he, shall have her,
Though twenty thousand worthier come to crave her.
