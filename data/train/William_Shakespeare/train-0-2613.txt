PRINCE OF WALES As cheerful sounding to my youthful spleen
This tumult is of war’s increasing broils,
As at the coronation of a king
The joyful clamours of the people are
When ‘Ave Caesar’ they pronounce aloud.
Within this school of honour I shall learn
Either to sacrifice my foes to death,
Or, in a rightful quarrel, spend my breath.
Then cheerfully forward, each a several way.
In great affairs ’tis naught to use delay. Exeunt
