Alarum. A retreat is sounded. Flourish.Enter at one door Cominius with the Romans, at another door Martius with his arm in a scarf 
COMINIUS (to Martius) If I should tell thee o‘er this thy day’s work
Thou’lt not believe thy deeds. But I’ll report it
Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles,
Where great patricians shall attend and shrug,
I‘th’ end admire; where ladies shall be frighted
And, gladly quaked, hear more; where the dull
tribunes,
That with the fusty plebeians hate thine honours,
Shall say against their hearts ‘We thank the gods
Our Rome hath such a soldier.’
Yet cam’st thou to a morsel of this feast,
Having fully dined before.
