Why give you me this shame? Think you I can a resolution fetch
From flow’ry tenderness? If I must die,
I will encounter darkness as a bride,
And hug it in mine arms. There spake my brother; there my father’s grave
Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die.
Thou art too noble to conserve a life
In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,
Whose settled visage and deliberate word
Nips youth i’th’ head and follies doth enew
As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil.
His filth within being cast, he would appear
A pond as deep as hell.
