The noble man have mercy. Who shall ask it? The tribunes cannot do‘t, for shame; the people
Deserve such pity of him as the wolf
Does of the shepherds. For his best friends, if they
Should say ‘Be good to Rome’, they charged him even
As those should do that had deserved his hate,
And therein showed like enemies.
