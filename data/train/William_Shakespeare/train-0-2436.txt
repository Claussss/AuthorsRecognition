But when a black-faced cloud the world doth threat,
In his dim mist th‘aspiring mountains hiding,
From earth’s dark womb some gentle gust doth get
Which blows these pitchy vapours from their biding,
Hind’ring their present fall by this dividing; So his unhallowed haste her words delays,
And moody Pluto winks while Orpheus plays.
