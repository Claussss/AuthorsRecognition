But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?
I think he will stand very strong with us. Let us not leave him out. CINNA No, by no means. O, let us have him, for his silver hairs
Will purchase us a good opinion,
And buy menâ€™s voices to commend our deeds.
It shall be said his judgement ruled our hands.
Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,
But all be buried in his gravity.
