Camillo has betrayed me, Whose honour and whose honesty till now
 Endured all weathers. Lay’t so to his charge. He’s with the King your father. Who, Camillo? Camillo, sir. I spake with him, who now
Has these poor men in question. Never saw I
Wretches so quake. They kneel, they kiss the earth,
Forswear themselves as often as they speak.
Bohemia stops his ears, and threatens them
With divers deaths in death.
