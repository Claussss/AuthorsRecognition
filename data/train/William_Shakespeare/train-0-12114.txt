THESEUS (to Emilia) You have steeled ’em with your beauty. (To Pirithous) Honoured friend, To you I give the field: pray order it
Fitting the persons that must use it. Come, I’ll go visit ’em—I cannot stay,
Their fame has fired me so. Till they appear,
Good friend, be royal. PIRITHOUS There shall want no bravery.
