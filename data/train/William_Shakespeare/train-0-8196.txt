Trumpets within (Aloud) The Moor—I know his trumpet. CASSIO ’Tis truly so. Let’s meet him and receive him. CASSIO Lo where he comes! Enter Othello and attendants OTHELLO (to Desdemona) O my fair warrior! DESDEMONA My dear Othello. It gives me wonder great as my content
To see you here before me. O my soul’s joy,
If after every tempest come such calms,
May the winds blow till they have wakened death,
And let the labouring barque climb hills of seas
Olympus-high, and duck again as low
As hell’s from heaven. If it were now to die
’Twere now to be most happy, for I fear
My soul hath her content so absolute
That not another comfort like to this
Succeeds in unknown fate.
