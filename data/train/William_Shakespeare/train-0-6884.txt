I pity you. That’s a degree to love. No, not a grece, for ’tis a vulgar proof
That very oft we pity enemies. Why then, methinks ’tis time to smile again.
O world, how apt the poor are to be proud!
If one should be a prey, how much the better
To fall before the lion than the wolf! Clock strikes The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.
Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you;
And yet when wit and youth is come to harvest
Your wife is like to reap a proper man.
There lies your way, due west.
