Tell her we measure them by weary steps. She hears herself. How many weary steps Of many weary miles you have oâ€™ergone
Are numbered in the travel of one mile? We number nothing that we spend for you.
Our duty is so rich, so infinite,
That we may do it still without account.
Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face
That we, like savages, may worship it.
