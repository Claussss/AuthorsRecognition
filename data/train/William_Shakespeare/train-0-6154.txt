CELIA Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally. ROSALIND I would we could do so, for her benefits are mightily misplaced; and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her gifts to women. CELIA â€™Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce makes honest, and those that she makes honest she makes very ill-favouredly.
