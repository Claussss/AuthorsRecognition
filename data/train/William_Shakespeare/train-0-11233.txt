Nay, be brief. I see into thy end, and am almost
A man already. First, make yourself but like one. Forethinking this, I have already fit—
’Tis in my cloak-bag—doublet, hat, hose, all
That answer to them. Would you in their serving,
And with what imitation you can borrow
From youth of such a season, fore noble Lucius
Present yourself, desire his service, tell him
Wherein you’re happy—which will make him know
If that his head have ear in music—doubtless
With joy he will embrace you, for he’s honourable,
And, doubling that, most holy. Your means abroad—
You have me, rich, and I will never fail
Beginning nor supplyment.
