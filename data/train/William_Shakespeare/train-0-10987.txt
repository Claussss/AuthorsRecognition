Set me where you stand. Give me your hand. You are now within a foot
Of th’extreme verge. For all beneath the moon
Would I not leap upright. Let go my hand. Here, friend, ’s another purse; in it a jewel
Well worth a poor man’s taking. Fairies and gods
Prosper it with thee! Go thou further off.
Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.
