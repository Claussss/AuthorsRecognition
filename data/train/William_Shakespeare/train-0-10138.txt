MENENIUS Well, what then? The former agents, if they did complain,
What could the belly answer? I will tell you, If you’ll bestow a small of what you have tittle—
Patience—a while, you’st hear the belly’s answer. You’re long about it. MENENIUS Note me this, good friend: Your most grave belly was deliberate,
Not rash like his accusers, and thus answered:
‘True is it, my incorporate friends,’ quoth he,
‘That I receive the general food at first
Which you do live upon, and fit it is,
Because I am the storehouse and the shop
Of the whole body. But, if you do remember,
I send it through the rivers of your blood
Even to the court, the heart, to th’ seat o’th’ brain;
And through the cranks and offices of man
The strongest nerves and small inferior veins
From me receive that natural competency
Whereby they live. And though that all at once’—
You my good friends, this says the belly, mark me—
