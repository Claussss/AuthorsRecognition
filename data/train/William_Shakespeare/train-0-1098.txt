How now, fair lords? What fare? What news abroad? Great lord of Warwick, if we should recount
Our baleful news, and at each word’s deliverance
Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told,
The words would add more anguish than the wounds.
O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain. O Warwick, Warwick! That Plantagenet,
Which held thee dearly as his soul’s redemption,
Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death.
