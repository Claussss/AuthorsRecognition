Exeunt Lear, Kent, and attendants Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this? Never afflict yourself to know more of it,
But let his disposition have that scope
As dotage gives it. Enter King Lear What, fifty of my followers at a clap?
Within a fortnight? What’s the matter, sir? I’ll tell thee. (To Goneril) Life and death! I am ashamed
That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus,
That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,
Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon
thee!
Th’untented woundings of a father’s curse
Pierce every sense about thee! Old fond eyes,
Beweep this cause again I’ll pluck ye out
And cast you, with the waters that you loose,
To temper clay. Ha! Let it be so.
I have another daughter
Who, I am sure, is kind and comfortable.
When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails
She’ll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find
That I’ll resume the shape which thou dost think
I have cast off for ever.
