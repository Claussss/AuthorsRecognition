KING EDWARD That needs no further question, and I know
His conscience witnesseth it is my right.
Therefore, Valois, say: wilt thou yet resign
Before the sickleâ€™s thrust into the corn,
Or that enkindled fury turn to flame? KING OF FRANCE Edward, I know what right thou hast in France,
And ere I basely will resign my crown
This champaign field shall be a pool of blood,
And all our prospect as a slaughterhouse.
