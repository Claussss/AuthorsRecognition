Ah, but it is mine oath, my gracious lord,
Which I in conscience may not violateâ€”
Or else a kingdom should not draw me hence. Thine oath? Why, that doth bind thee to abide.
Hast thou not sworn obedience to thy Prince? In all things that uprightly he commands.
But either to persuade or threaten me
Not to perform the covenant of my word
Is lawless, and I need not to obey.
