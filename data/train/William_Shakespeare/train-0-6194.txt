What shall I call thee when thou art a man? I’ll have no worse a name than Jove’s own page,
And therefore look you call me Ganymede.
But what will you be called? Something that hath a reference to my state.
No longer Celia, but Aliena. But cousin, what if we essayed to steal
The clownish fool out of your father’s court.
Would he not be a comfort to our travel?
