But as the earth doth weep, the sun being set,
Each flower moistened like a melting eye,
Even so the maid with swelling drops gan wet
Her circled eyne, enforced by sympathy
Of those fair suns set in her mistressâ€™ sky, Who in a salt-waved ocean quench their light;
Which makes the maid weep like the dewy night.
