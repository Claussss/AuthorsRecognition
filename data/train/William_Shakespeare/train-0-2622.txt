Enter Sir William de Montague with soldiers O summer’s day! See where my cousin comes! How fares my aunt? We are not Scots—
Why do you shut your gates against your friends? COUNTESS OF SALISBURY Well may I give a welcome, coz, to thee,
For thou com’st well to chase my foes from hence. The King himself is come in person hither.
Dear aunt, descend, and gratulate his highness.
