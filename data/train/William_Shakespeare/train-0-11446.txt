Thou most lying slave, Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used
thee,
Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodged thee
In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate
The honour of my child. O ho,O ho! Wouldâ€™t had been done!
Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else
This isle with Calibans.
