Why call you me ‘love’ ? Call my sister so. ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Thy sister’s sister. LUCIANA That’s my sister. ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE It is thyself, mine own self’s better part,
Mine eye’s clear eye, my dear heart’s dearer heart,
My food, my fortune, and my sweet hope’s aim,
My sole earth’s heaven, and my heaven’s claim.
