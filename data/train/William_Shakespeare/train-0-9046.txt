KING DUNCAN Where’s the Thane of Cawdor? We coursed him at the heels, and had a purpose
To be his purveyor; but he rides well,
And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him
To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,
We are your guest tonight. LADY MACBETH Your servants ever Have theirs, themselves, and what is theirs in count
To make their audit at your highness’ pleasure,
Still to return your own.
