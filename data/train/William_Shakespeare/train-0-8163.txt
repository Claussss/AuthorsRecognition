DUKE Why, at her father’s! BRABANZIO I will not have it so. OTHELLO Nor I. DESDEMONA Nor would I there reside, To put my father in impatient thoughts
By being in his eye. Most gracious Duke,
To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear,
And let me find a charter in your voice
T’assist my simpleness. What would you, Desdemona?
