I did not, sir. These lords, my noble fellows, if they please
Can clear me in’t. We can. My royal liege, He is not guilty of her coming hither. LEONTES You’re liars all. Beseech your highness, give us better credit.
We have always truly served you, and beseech
So to esteem of us. And on our knees we beg,
As recompense of our dear services
Past and to come, that you do change this purpose
Which, being so horrible, so bloody, must
Lead on to some foul issue. We all kneel.
