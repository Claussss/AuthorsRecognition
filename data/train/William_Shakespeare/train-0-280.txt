Then speak the truth by her; if not divine,
Yet let her be a principality,
Sovereign to all the creatures on the earth. Except my mistress. VALENTINE Sweet, except not any, Except thou wilt except against my love. Have I not reason to prefer mine own? And I will help thee to prefer her, too.
She shall be dignified with this high honour,
To bear my ladyâ€™s train, lest the base earth
Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss
And, of so great a favour growing proud,
Disdain to root the summer-swelling flower,
And make rough winter everlastingly.
