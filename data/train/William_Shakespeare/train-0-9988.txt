Sc. 11 Thunder and lightning.Enter Pericles a-shipboard The god of this great vast rebuke these surges
Which wash both heav’n and hell; and thou that hast
Upon the winds command, bind them in brass,
Having called them from the deep. O still
Thy deaf‘ning dreadful thunders, gently quench
Thy nimble sulph’rous flashes.—O, ho, Lychorida!
How does my queen?—Thou stormest venomously.
Wilt thou spit all thyself The seaman’s whistle
Is as a whisper in the ears of death,
Unheard.—Lychorida!—Lucina, O!
Divinest patroness, and midwife gentle
To those that cry by night, convey thy deity
Aboard our dancing boat, make swift the pangs
Of my queen’s travails!—Now, Lychorida.
