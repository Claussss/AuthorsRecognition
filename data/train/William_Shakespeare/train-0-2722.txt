ALL THE FRENCH Vive le roil God save King Jean of Francel KING OF FRANCE Now, on this plain of Cr
And, Edward, when thou dar’st, begin the fight! Exit with the French KING EDWARD (calling after) We presently will meet thee, Jean of France!
(To the English) And, English lords, let us resolve the day
Either to clear us of that scandalous crime
Or be entombed in our innocence.
(To the Prince of Wales) And, Ned, because this battle is the first
That ever yet thou fought’st in pitched field,
As ancient custom is of martialists
To dub thee with the type of chivalry,
In solemn manner we will give thee arms.
Come, therefore, heralds; orderly bring forth
A strong attirement for the Prince my son.
