ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS You have prevailed. I will depart in quiet,
And in despite of mirth mean to be merry.
I know a wench of excellent discourse,
Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle.
There will we dine. This woman that I mean,
My wife—but, I protest, without desert—
Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal.
To her will we to dinner. (To Angelo) Get you home
And fetch the chain. By this, I know, ’tis made.
Bring it, I pray you, to the Porcupine,
For there’s the house. That chain will I bestow—
Be it for nothing but to spite my wife—
Upon mine hostess there. Good sir, make haste:
Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,
I’ll knock elsewhere, to see if they’ll disdain me.
