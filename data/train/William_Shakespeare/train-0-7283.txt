DIOMEDES Come, tell me whose it was? ’Twas one’s that loved me better than you will.
But now you have it, take it. DIOMEDES Whose was it? By all Diana’s waiting-women yond,
And by herself, I will not tell you whose. Tomorrow will I wear it on my helm,
And grieve his spirit that dares, not challenge it.
