Good my liege— LEAR Peace, Kent. Come not between the dragon and his wrath.
I loved her most, and thought to set my rest
On her kind nursery. To Cordelia
my sight!—
So be my grave my peace as here I give
Her father’s heart from her. Call France. Who stirs?
Call Burgundy. Exit
one or
more Cornwall and Albany,
