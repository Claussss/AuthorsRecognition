AJAX I thank thee, Hector. Thou art too gentle and too free a man.
I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear hence
A great addition earned in thy death. Not Neoptolemus so mirable,
On whose bright crest Fame with her loud‘st oyez
Cries ’This is he!’, could promise to himself
A thought of added honour torn from Hector.
