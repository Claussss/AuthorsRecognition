Alonso, Sebastian, and Antonio stand amazed But remember,
For that’s my business to you, that you three
From Milan did supplant good Prospero;
Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,
Him and his innocent child; for which foul deed,
The powers, delaying not forgetting, have
Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,
Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,
They have bereft, and do pronounce by me
Ling’ring perdition—worse than any death
Can be at once—shatt step by step attend
You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you
from—
Which here in this most desolate isle else falls
Upon your heads—is nothing but heart’s sorrow
And a clear life ensuing.
