TIMON (drinking to a Lord) My lord, in heart; and let the health go round. SECOND LORD Let it flow this way, my good lord. APEMANTUS ‘Flow this way’? A brave fellow; he keeps his tides well. Those healths will make thee and thy state look ill, Timon. Here’s that which is too weak to be a sinner:
Honest water, which ne‘er left man i’th’ mire.
This and my food are equals; there’s no odds.
Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods.
