As surely as my soul intends to live
With that dread King that took our state upon Him
To free us from his Fatherâ€™s wrathful curse,
I do believe that violent hands were laid
Upon the life of this thrice-famed Duke. A dreadful oath, sworn with a solemn tongue!
What instance gives Lord Warwick for his vow?
