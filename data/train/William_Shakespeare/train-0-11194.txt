Ay, and it doth confirm Another stain as big as hell can hold,
Were there no more but it. Will you hear more? Spare your arithmetic, never count the turns.
Once, and a million! I’ll be sworn. No swearing. If you will swear you have not done‘t, you lie,
And I will kill thee if thou dost deny
Thou’st made me cuckold.
