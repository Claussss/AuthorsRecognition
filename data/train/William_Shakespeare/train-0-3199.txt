(To Catherine and Maria)
And change you favours, too. So shall your loves
Woo contrary, deceived by these removes. Catherine and Maria change favours Come on, then, wear the favours most in sight. But in this changing what is your intent? The effect of my intent is to cross theirs.
They do it but in mockery-merriment,
And mock for mock is only my intent.
Their several counsels they unbosom shall
To loves mistook, and so be mocked withal
Upon the next occasion that we meet
With visages displayed to talk and greet.
