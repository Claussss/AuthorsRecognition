My gracious prince and honourable peers,
Hearing of your arrival in this realm
I have a while given truce unto my wars
To do my duty to my sovereign;
In sign whereof, this arm that hath reclaimed
To your obedience fifty fortresses,
Twelve cities, and seven walled towns of strength,
Beside five hundred prisoners of esteem,
Lets fall his sword before your highnessâ€™ feet,
And with submissive loyalty of heart
Ascribes the glory of his conquest got
First to my God, and next unto your grace.
