Exeunt at another door 5.1
Enter Lorenzo and Jessica The moon shines bright. In such a night as this,
When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees
And they did make no noiseâ€”in such a night
Troilus, methinks, mounted the Trojan walls,
And sighed his soul toward the Grecian tents
Where Cressid lay that night.
