This is the rascal, this is he I spoke of. Why, thou unreverend and unhallowed friar,
Is’t not enough thou hast suborned these women
To accuse this worthy man but, in foul mouth,
And in the witness of his proper ear,
To call him villain, and then to glance from him
To th’ Duke himself, to tax him with injustice?
Take him hence; to th’ rack with him. We’ll touse you
Joint by joint—but we will know his purpose.
What, ‘unjust’?
