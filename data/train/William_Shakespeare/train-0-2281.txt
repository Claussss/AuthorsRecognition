For from the stillitory of thy face excelling
Comes breath perfumed, that breedeth love by
smelling. ‘But O, what banquet wert thou to the taste,
Being nurse and feeder of the other four!
Would they not wish the feast might ever last
And bid suspicion double-lock the door Lest jealousy, that sour unwelcome guest,
Should by his stealing-in disturb the feast?’
