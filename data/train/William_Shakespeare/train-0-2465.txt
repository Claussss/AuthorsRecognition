And fellowship in woe doth woe assuage,
As palmers’ chat makes short their pilgrimage. ‘Where now I have no one to blush with me,
To cross their arms and hang their heads with mine,
To mask their brows and hide their infamy,
But I alone, alone must sit and pine,
Seasoning the earth with showers of silver brine,
