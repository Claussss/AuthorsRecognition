GEORGE OF CLARENCE For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves
To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford. KING EDWARD Ay, what of that? It was my will and grantâ€”
And for this once my will shall stand for law. RICHARD OF GLOUCESTER And yet, methinks, your grace hath not done well
To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales
Unto the brother of your loving bride.
She better would have fitted me or Clarence,
But in your bride you bury brotherhood.
