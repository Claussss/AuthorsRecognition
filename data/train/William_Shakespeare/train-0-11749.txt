QUEEN KATHERINE What need you note it? Pray you keep your way.
When you are called, return. Now the Lord help.
They vex me past my patience. Pray you, pass on.
I will not tarry; no, nor ever more
Upon this business my appearance make
In any of their courts. Exeunt Queen Katherine and her attendants Go thy ways, Kate.
