For who so base would such an office have
As sland’rous deathsman to so base a slave? ‘The baser is he, coming from a king,
To shame his hope with deeds degenerate.
The mightier man, the mightier is the thing
That makes him honoured or begets him hate,
For greatest scandal waits on greatest state. The moon being clouded presently is missed,
But little stars may hide them when they list.
