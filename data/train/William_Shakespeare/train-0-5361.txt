My knight, I will inflame thy noble liver,
And make thee rage.
Thy Doll, and Helen of thy noble thoughts,
Is in base durance and contagious prison,
Haled thither
By most mechanical and dirty hand.
Rouse up Revenge from ebon den with fell Alecto’s
snake,
For Doll is in. Pistol speaks naught but truth.
SIR JOHN I will deliver her.
