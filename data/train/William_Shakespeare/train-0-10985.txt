Horrible steep. Hark, do you hear the sea? Why, then your other senses grow imperfect
By your eyes’ anguish. So may it be indeed. Methinks thy voice is altered, and thou speak’st
In better phrase and matter than thou didst. You’re much deceived. In nothing am I changed
But in my garments. Methinks you’re better spoken.
