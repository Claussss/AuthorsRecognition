‘First of the King: what shall of him become?
The Duke yet lives that Henry shall depose,
But him outlive and die a violent death.’
God’s will be done in all. Well, to the rest.
(Reads) ‘Tell me what fate awaits the Duke of Suffolk?
By water shall he die, and take his end.’ SUFFOLK [aside] By water must the Duke of Suffolk die?
It must be so, or else the devil doth lie.
