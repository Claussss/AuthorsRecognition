I am joyful To meet the least occasion that may give me
Remembrance of my father-in-law the Duke,
To be revenged on him. Which of the peers Have uncontemned gone by him, or at least
Strangely neglected? When did he regard
The stamp of nobleness in any person
Out of himself? LORD CHAMBERLAIN My lords, you speak your pleasures.
