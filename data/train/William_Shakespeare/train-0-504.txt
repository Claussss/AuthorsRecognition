Petruccio is my name, Antonioâ€™s son,
A man well known throughout all Italy. I know him well. You are welcome for his sake. Saving your tale, Petruccio, I pray
Let us that are poor petitioners speak too.
Baccare, you are marvellous forward. O pardon me, Signor Gremio, I would fain be doing. I doubt it not, sir. But you will curse your wooing. (To Baptista) Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am sure of it. To express the like kindness, myself, that have been more kindly beholden to you than any, freely give unto you this young scholar (presenting Lucentio) that hath been long studying at Rheims, as cunning in Greek, Latin, and other languages as the other in music and mathematics. His name is Cambio. Pray accept his service.
