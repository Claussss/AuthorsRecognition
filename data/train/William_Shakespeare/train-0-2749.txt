You wretched patterns of despair and woeâ€”
What are you? Living men, or gliding ghosts
Crept from your graves to walk upon the earth? No ghosts, my lord, but men that breathe a life
Far worse than is the quiet sleep of death.
We are distressed poor inhabitants
That long have been diseased, sick and lame.
And now, because we are not fit to serve,
The Captain of the town hath thrust us forth
That so expense of victuals may be saved.
