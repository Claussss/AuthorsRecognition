LONGUEVILLE (coming forward) Dumaine, thy love is far from charity,
That in love’s grief desir‘st society.
You may look pale, but I should blush, I know,
To be o’erheard and taken napping so. KING (coming forward) Come, sir, you blush. As his, your case is such.
You chide at him, offending twice as much.
You do not love Maria? Longueville
Did never sonnet for her sake compile,
Nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart
His loving bosom to keep down his heart?
I have been closely shrouded in this bush,
And marked you both, and for you both did blush.
I heard your guilty rhymes, observed your fashion,
Saw sighs reek from you, noted well your passion.
‘Ay me!’ says one, ‘O jovel’ the other cries.
One, her hairs were gold; crystal the other’s eyes.
(To Longueville) You would for paradise break faith and troth,
(To Dumaine) And Jove for your love would infringe an oath.
What will Biron say when that he shall hear
Faith so infringed, which such zeal did swear?
How will he scorn, how will he spend his wit!
How will he triumph, leap, and laugh at it!
For all the wealth that ever I did see
I would not have him know so much by me.
