POLIXENES (to Leontes) Dear my brother, Let him that was the cause of this have power
To take off so much grief from you as he
Will piece up in himself. PAULINA (to Leontes) Indeed, my lord, If I had thought the sight of my poor image
Would thus have wrought you—for the stone is mine—
I’d not have showed it.
