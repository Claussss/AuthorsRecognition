ALBANY Sir, by your patience, I hold you but a subject of this war, Not as a brother. REGAN Thatâ€™s as we list to grace him. Methinks our pleasure should have been demanded
Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers,
Bore the commission of my place and person,
The which immediate may well stand up
And call itself your brother.
