Why dost thou stop my mouth? LANCE For fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue. PANTHINO Where should I lose my tongue? LANCE In thy tale. PANTHINO In thy tail! LANCE Lose the tide, and the voyage, and the master, and the service, and the tied? Why, man, if the river were dry, I am able to fill it with my tears. If the wind were down, I could drive the boat with my sighs.
