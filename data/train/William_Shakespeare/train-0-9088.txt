Here’s our chief guest. LADY MACBETH If he had been forgotten It had been as a gap in our great feast,
And all-thing unbecoming. MACBETH (to Banquo) Tonight we hold a solemn supper, sir,
And I’ll request your presence. Let your highness Command upon me, to the which my duties
Are with a most indissoluble tie
For ever knit.
