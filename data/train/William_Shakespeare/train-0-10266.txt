CORIOLANUS I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no farther. BOTH CITIZENS The gods give you joy, sir, heartily. CORIOLANUS Most sweet voices. Exeunt Citizens Better it is to die, better to starve,
Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.
Why in this womanish toge should I stand here
To beg of Hob and Dick that does appear
Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to’t.
What custom wills, in all things should we do‘t,
The dust on antique time would lie unswept,
And mountainous error be too highly heaped
For truth to o’erpeer. Rather than fool it so,
Let the high office and the honour go
To one that would do thus. I am half through.
The one part suffered, the other will I do.
