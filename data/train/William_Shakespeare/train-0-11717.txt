And with some other business put the King
From these sad thoughts that work too much upon him.
(To the Lord Chamberlain)
My lord, you’ll bear us company? LORD CHAMBERLAIN The King has sent me otherwhere. Besides,
You’ll find a most unfit time to disturb him.
Health to your lordships. Thanks, my good Lord Chamberlain.
