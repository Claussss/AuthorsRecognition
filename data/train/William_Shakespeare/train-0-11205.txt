Enter Innogen Lo, here she comes. I am ignorant in what I am commanded. INNOGEN How now, Pisanio? Madam, here is a letter from my lord. Who, thy lord that is my lord, Leonatus?
O learned indeed were that astronomer
That knew the stars as I his characters—
He’d lay the future open. You good gods,
Let what is here contained relish of love,
Of my lord’s health, of his content—yet not
That we two are asunder; let that grieve him.
Some griefs are med’cinable; that is one of them,
For it doth physic love—of his content
All but in that. Good wax, thy leave. Blest be
You bees that make these locks of counsel! Lovers
And men in dangerous bonds pray not alike;
Though forfeiters you cast in prison, yet
You clasp young Cupid’s tables. Good news, gods!
