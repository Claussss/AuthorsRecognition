KENT (to Lear) Oppressed nature sleeps. This rest might yet have balmed thy broken sinews
Which, if convenience will not allow,
Stand in hard cure. (To Fool) Come, help to bear thy
master.
Thou must not stay behind. GLOUCESTER Come, come away. Exeunt all but Edgar When we our betters see bearing our woes,
We scarcely think our miseries our foes.
Who alone suffers, suffers most i‘th’ mind,
Leaving free things and happy shows behind.
But then the mind much sufferance doth o’erskip
When grief hath mates, and bearing fellowship.
How light and portable my pain seems now,
When that which makes me bend, makes the King
bow.
He childed as I fathered. Tom, away.
Mark the high noises, and thyself bewray
When false opinion, whose wrong thoughts defile thee,
In thy just proof repeals and reconciles thee.
What will hap more tonight, safe scape the King!
Lurk, lurk.
