Clarence sleeps  Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,
Makes the night morning and the noontide night.
Princes have but their titles for their glories,
An outward honour for an inward toil,
And for unfelt imaginations
They often feel a world of restless cares;
So that, between their titles and low name,
Thereâ€™s nothing differs but the outward fame.
