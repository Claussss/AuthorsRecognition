How many thousand times hath these poor lips,
When they were living, warmed themselves on thine!
O now, sweet boy, give them their latest kiss.
Bid him farewell. Commit him to the grave.
Do them that kindness, and take leave of them. YOUNG LUCIUS (kissing Titus) O grandsire, grandsire, evâ€™n with all my heart
Would I were dead, so you did live again.
O Lord, I cannot speak to him for weeping.
My tears will choke me if I ope my mouth.
