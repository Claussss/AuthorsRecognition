PRINCE HARRY Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me, and I’ll play my father. SIR JOHN (standing) Depose me. If thou dost it half so gravely, so majestically both in word and matter, hang me up by the heels for a rabbit sucker, or a poulter’s hare. PRINCE HARRY (sitting) Well, here I am set.
