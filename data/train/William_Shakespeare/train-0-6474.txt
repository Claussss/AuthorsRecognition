QUEEN GERTRUDE I doubt it is no other but the main—
His father’s death and our o’er-hasty marriage. KING CLAUDIUS Well, we shall sift him. Enter Polonius, Valtemand, and Cornelius Welcome, my good friends.  Say, Valtemand, what from our brother Norway? Most fair return of greetings and desires.
Upon our first he sent out to suppress
His nephew’s levies, which to him appeared
To be a preparation ‘gainst the Polack;
But better looked into, he truly found
It was against your highness; whereat grieved
That so his sickness, age, and impotence
Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
On Fortinbras, which he, in brief, obeys,
Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
Makes vow before his uncle never more
To give th’essay of arms against your majesty;
Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
And his commission to employ those soldiers
So levied as before, against the Polack,
With an entreaty herein further shown,
He gives a letter to Claudius
That it might please you to give quiet pass
Through your dominions for his enterprise
On such regards of safety and allowance
As therein are set down.
