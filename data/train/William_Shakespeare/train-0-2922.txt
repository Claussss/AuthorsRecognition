4.1
Enter Second Merchant, Angelo the goldsmith, and an Officer 
SECOND MERCHANT (to Angelo) You know since Pentecost the sum is due,
And since I have not much importuned you;
Nor now I had not, but that I am bound
To Persia, and want guilders for my voyage.
Therefore make present satisfaction,
Or Iâ€™ll attach you by this officer.
