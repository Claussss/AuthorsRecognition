FIRST LORD DUMAINE Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from point, to the full arming of the verity. SECOND LORD DUMAINE I am heartily sorry that heâ€™ll be glad of this. FIRST LORD DUMAINE How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses. SECOND LORD DUMAINE And how mightily some other times we drown our gain in tears. The great dignity that his valour hath here acquired for him shall at home be encountered with a shame as ample.
