You are too senseless-obstinate, my lord,
Too ceremonious and traditional.
Weigh it not with the grossness of this age.
You break not sanctuary in seizing him.
The benefit thereof is always granted
To those whose dealings have deserved the place,
And those who have the wit to claim the place.
This prince hath neither claimed it nor deserved it,
And therefore, in my mind, he cannot have it.
Then taking him from thence that ‘longs not there,
You break thereby no privilege nor charter.
Oft have I heard of ‘sanctuary men‘,
But ‘sanctuary children’ ne’er till now.
