SECOND LORD Yes, sir. JAQUES Sing it. ’Tis no matter how it be in tune, so it make noise enough. LORDS (sing) What shall he have that killed the deer?
His leather skin and horns to wear.
Then sing him home; the rest shall bear
This burden.
Take thou no scorn to wear the horn;
It was a crest ere thou wast born.
Thy father’s father wore it,
And thy father bore it.
The horn, the horn, the lusty horn
Is not a thing to laugh to scorn.
