So soon was she along as he was down,
Each leaning on their elbows and their hips.
Now doth she stroke his cheek, now doth he frown
And ’gins to chide, but soon she stops his lips, And, kissing, speaks, with lustful language broken:
‘If thou wilt chide, thy lips shall never open.’ He burns with bashful shame; she with her tears
Doth quench the maiden burning of his cheeks.
Then, with her windy sighs and golden hairs,
To fan and blow them dry again she seeks.
