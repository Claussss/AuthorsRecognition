Heavy heart’s lead, melt at mine eyes’ red fire!
So shall I die by drops of hot desire. ‘Alas, poor world, what treasure hast thou lost,
What face remains alive that’s worth the viewing?
Whose tongue is music now? What canst thou boast
Of things long since, or anything ensuing? The flowers are sweet, their colours fresh and trim;
But true sweet beauty lived and died with him.
