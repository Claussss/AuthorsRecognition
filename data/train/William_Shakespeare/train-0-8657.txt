she kisses him Conceive, and fare you well. EDMUND Yours in the ranks of death. GONORIL My most dear Gloucester. Exit Edmund To thee a womanâ€™s services are due;
My foot usurps my body. OSWALD Madam, here comes my lord. Enter the Duke of Albany I have been worth the whistling. ALBANY O Gonoril, You are not worth the dust which the rude wind
Blows in your face. I fear your disposition.
That nature which contemns it origin
Cannot be bordered certain in itself.
She that herself will sliver and disbranch
From her material sap perforce must wither,
And come to deadly use.
