OLD ATHENIAN If in her marriage my consent be missing,
I call the gods to witness, I will choose
Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world,
And dispossess her all. TIMON How shall she be endowed If she be mated with an equal husband? OLD ATHENIAN Three talents on the present; in future, all. This gentleman of mine hath served me long.
To build his fortune I will strain a little,
For ’tis a bond in men. Give him thy daughter.
What you bestow in him I’ll counterpoise,
And make him weigh with her.
