How fair the Tribune speaks to calm my thoughts. Marcus Andronicus, so I do affy
In thy uprightness and integrity,
And so I love and honour thee and thine,
Thy noble brother Titus and his sons,
And her to whom my thoughts are humbled all,
Gracious Lavinia, Rome’s rich ornament,
That I will here dismiss my loving friends
And to my fortunes and the people’s favour
Commit my cause in balance to be weighed.
