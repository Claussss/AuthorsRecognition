Wit, look to that! Eight angels? I did send them ten.
Who gave it them? I, my lord. I had no more about me;
But by and by they shall receive the rest. Well, Wit, ‘twas wisely done. Thou play’st Wit well
indeed
Not to be thus deceived of thy right.
Am I a man by office truly ordained
Equally to divide true right his own,
And shall I have deceivers in my house?
Then what avails my bounty, when such servants
Deceive the poor of what the master gives?
Go one and pull his coat over his ears.
There are too many such. Give them their right.
Wit, let thy fellows thank thee; ’twas well done.
Thou now deservest to match with Lady Wisdom.
