I must not yield to any rites of love,
For my profession’s sacred from above.
When I have chased all thy foes from hence,
Then will I think upon a recompense. Meantime, look gracious on thy prostrate thrall. RENto the other lords apart My lord, methinks, is very long in talk. Doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock,
Else ne’er could he so long protract his speech.
