My name, sir, is Marina. O, I am mocked, And thou by some incensed god sent hither
To make the world to laugh at me. MARINA Patience, good sir, Or here I’ll cease. Nay, I’ll be patient. Thou little know’st how thou dost startle me
To call thyself Marina. Was given me by one that had some power:
My father, and a king.
