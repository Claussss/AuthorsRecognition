I am enjoined by oath to observe three things:
First, never to unfold to anyone 10
Which casket â€™twas I chose. Next, if I fail
Of the right casket, never in my life
To woo a maid in way of marriage.
Lastly, if I do fail in fortune of my choice,
Immediately to leave you and be gone. 15 To these injunctions everyone doth swear
That comes to hazard for my worthless self.
