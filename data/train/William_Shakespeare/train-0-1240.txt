Then, for his mind, be Edward England’s king. Warwick takes off Edward’s crown But Henry now shall wear the English crown,
And be true king indeed, thou but the shadow.
My lord of Somerset, at my request,
See that, forthwith, Duke Edward be conveyed
Unto my brother, Archbishop of York.
When I have fought with Pembroke and his fellows,
I’ll follow you, and tell what answer
Louis and the Lady Bona send to him.
Now for a while farewell, good Duke of York.
