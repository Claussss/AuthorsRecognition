Now, by the sky that hangs above our heads,
I like it well.-France, shall we knit our powers,
And lay this Angers even with the ground,
Then after fight who shall be king of it? BASTARD (to King Philip) An if thou hast the mettle of a king,
Being wronged as we are by this peevish town,
Turn thou the mouth of thy artillery,
As we will ours, against these saucy walls;
And when that we have dashed them to the ground,
Why, then defy each other, and pell-mell
Make work upon ourselves, for heaven or hell.
