ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Justice, sweet prince, against that woman there,
She whom thou gavâ€™st to me to be my wife,
That hath abused and dishonoured me
Even in the strength and height of injury.
Beyond imagination is the wrong
That she this day hath shameless thrown on me. Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.
