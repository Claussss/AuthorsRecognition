Portia, art thou gone? BRUTUS No more, I pray you.
They sit  Messala, I have here received letters
That young Octavius and Mark Antony
Come down upon us with a mighty power,
Bending their expedition toward Philippi. Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor. BRUTUS With what addition? That by proscription and bills of outlawry
Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus
Have put to death an hundred senators.
