I am maimed for ever. Help, ho, murder, murder! Enter Othello [above] The voice of Cassio. Iago keeps his word. RODERIGO O, villain that I am! OTHELLO It is even so. CASSIO O, help, ho! Light, a surgeon! ’Tis he. O brave Iago, honest and just,
That hast such noble sense of thy friend’s wrong—
Thou teachest me. Minion, your dear lies dead,
And your unblessed fate hies. Strumpet, I come.
Forth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are blotted.
Thy bed, lust-stained, shall with lust’s blood be spotted.
