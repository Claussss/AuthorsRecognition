What do you mean, my lord? CLAUDIO Not to be married, Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton. Dear my lord, if you in your own proof
Have vanquished the resistance of her youth
And made defeat of her virginityâ€” I know what you would say. If I have known her,
You will say she did embrace me as a husband,
And so extenuate the forehand sin.
No, Leonato,
I never tempted her with word too large,
But as a brother to his sister showed
Bashful sincerity and comely love.
