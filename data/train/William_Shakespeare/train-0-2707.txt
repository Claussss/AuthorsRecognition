Tush, they that have already taken arms
Are many fearful millions in respect
Of that small handful of our enemies.
But ’tis a rightful quarrel must prevail:
Edward is son unto our late king’s sister,
Where Jean Valois is three degrees removed. FRENCHWOMAN Besides, there goes a prophecy abroad,
Published by one that was a friar once,
Whose oracles have many times proved true,
And now he says the time will shortly come
Whenas a lion roused in the west
Shall carry hence the fleur-de-lis of France.
These, I can tell ye, and such like surmises,
Strike many Frenchmen cold unto the heart.
