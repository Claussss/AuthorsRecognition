In’s bosom. We have been soldiers, and we cannot weep
When our friends don their helms, or put to sea,
Or tell of babes broached on the lance, or women
That have sod their infants in—and after eat them—
The brine they wept at killing ’em: then if
You stay to see of us such spinsters, we
Should hold you here forever.
