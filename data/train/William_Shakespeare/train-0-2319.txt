No, lady, no. My heart longs not to groan,
But soundly sleeps, while now it sleeps alone. ‘What have you urged that I cannot reprove?
The path is smooth that leadeth on to danger.
I hate not love, but your device in love,
That lends embracements unto every stranger. You do it for increase—O strange excuse,
When reason is the bawd to lust’s abuse!
