An if I do not, may my hands rot off,
And never brandish more revengeful steel
Over the glittering helmet of my foe. My lord Fitzwalter, I do remember well
The very time Aumerle and you did talk. â€™Tis very true. You were in presence then,
And you can witness with me this is true. As false, by heaven, as heaven itself is true.
