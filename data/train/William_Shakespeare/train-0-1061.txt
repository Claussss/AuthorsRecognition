PRINCE EDWARD Father, you cannot disinherit me.
If you be king, why should not I succeed? Pardon me, Margaret; pardon me, sweet son—
The Earl of Warwick and the Duke enforced me. QUEEN MARGARET Enforced thee? Art thou king, and wilt be forced?
I shame to hear thee speak! Ah, timorous wretch,
Thou hast undone thyself, thy son, and me,
And giv’n unto the house of York such head
As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance.
To entail him and his heirs unto the crown—
What is it, but to make thy sepulchre
And creep into it far before thy time?
Warwick is Chancellor and the Lord of Calais;
Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas;
The Duke is made Protector of the Realm;
And yet shalt thou be safe? Such safety finds
The trembling lamb environ
Had I been there, which am a seely woman,
The soldiers should have tossed me on their pikes
Before I would have granted to that act.
But thou preferr’st thy life before thine honour.
And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself
Both from thy table, Henry, and thy bed,
Until that act of Parliament be repealed
Whereby my son is disinherited.
The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours
Will follow mine, if once they see them spread—
And spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace
And the utter ruin of the house of York.
Thus do I leave thee. (To Prince Edward) Come, son,
let’s away.
Our army is ready—come, we’ll after them.
