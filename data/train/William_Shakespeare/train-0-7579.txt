Believe me, Master Suresby, this is strange,
You being a man so settled in assurance
Will fall in that which you condemned in other. Well, Master Suresby, thereâ€™s your purse again,
And all your money. Fear nothing of More.
Wisdom still ( ) the door. Sc. 3
Enter the Earls of Shrewsbury and Surrey, Sir Thomas Palmer, and Sir Roger Cholmley
