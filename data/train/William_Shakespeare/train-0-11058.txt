Great thing of us forgot!— Speak, Edmond; where’s the King, and where’s
Cordelia?-
Seest thou this object, Kent? KENT Alack, why thus? EDMOND Yet Edmond was beloved. The one the other poisoned for my sake,
And after slew herself. Even so.—Cover their faces. I pant for life. Some good I mean to do,
Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send,
Be brief in it, to th’ castle; for my writ
Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia.
Nay, send in time.
