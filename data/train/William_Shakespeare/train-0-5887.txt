KING CHARLES Nor this I have not, brother, so denied,
But your request shall make me let it pass. I pray you then, in love and dear alliance,
Let that one article rank with the rest,
And thereupon give me your daughter. KING CHARLES Take her, fair son, and from her blood raise up
Issue to me, that the contending kingdoms
Of France and England, whose very shores look pale
With envy of each other’s happiness,
May cease their hatred, and this dear conjunction
Plant neighbourhood and Christian-like accord
In their sweet bosoms, that never war advance
His bleeding sword ’twixt England and fair France.
