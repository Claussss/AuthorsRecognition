Exeunt Buckingham and train The two Gentlemen come forward FIRST GENTLEMAN O, this is full of pity, sir; it calls,
I fear, too many curses on their heads
That were the authors. SECOND GENTLEMAN If the Duke be guiltless, â€™Tis full of woe. Yet I can give you inkling
Of an ensuing evil, if it fall,
Greater than this.
