ALL CADEExeunt multitudes below Enter a Messenger on the terrace MESSENGER (to King Henry) Please it your grace to be advertised
The Duke of York is newly come from Ireland,
And with a puissant and a mighty power
Of galloglasses and stout Irish kerns
Is marching hitherward in proud array,
And still proclaimeth, as he comes along,
His arms are only to remove from thee
The Duke of Somerset, whom he terms a traitor.
