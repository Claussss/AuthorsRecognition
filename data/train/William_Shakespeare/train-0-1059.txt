YORK (to King Henry) Farewell, my gracious lord, I’ll to my castle. Exeunt York, Edward, and Richard, with soldiers And I’ll keep London with my soldiers. Exit With soldiers And I to Norfolk with my followers. Exit With soldiers And I unto the sea from whence I came. Exit with soldiers And I with grief and sorrow to the court. King Henry and Exeter turn to leave.
