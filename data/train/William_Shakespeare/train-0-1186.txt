Renowned Queen, with patience calm the storm,
While we bethink a means to break it off. QUEEN MARGARET The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe. The more I stay, the more Iâ€™ll succour thee. QUEEN MARGARET O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow. Enter the Earl of Warwick And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow.
