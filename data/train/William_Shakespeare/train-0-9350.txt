ENOBARBUS I will praise any man that will praise me, though it cannot be denied what I have done by land. MENAS Nor what I have done by water. ENOBARBUS Yes, something you can deny for your own safety. You have been a great thief by sea. MENAS And you by land. ENOBARBUS There I deny my land service; but give me your hand, Menas. If our eyes had authority, here they might take two thieves kissing.
