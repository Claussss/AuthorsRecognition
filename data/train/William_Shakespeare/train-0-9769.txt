SECOND LORD DUMAINE We will not meddle with him till he come, for his presence must be the whip of the other. FIRST LORD DUMAINE In the mean time, what hear you of these wars? SECOND LORD DUMAINE I hear there is an overture of peace. FIRST LORD DUMAINE Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded. SECOND LORD DUMAINE What will Count Roussillon do then? Will he travel higher, or return again into France?
