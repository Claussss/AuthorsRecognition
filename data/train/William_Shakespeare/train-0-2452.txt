This said, he sets his foot upon the light;
For light and lust are deadly enemies.
Shame folded up in blind concealing night
When most unseen, then most doth tyrannize.
The wolf hath seized his prey, the poor lamb cries, Till with her own white fleece her voice controlled
Entombs her outcry in her lipsâ€™ sweet fold.
