CARDINAL BEAUFORT That he should die is worthy policy;
But yet we want a colour for his death.
â€™Tis meet he be condemned by course of law. But, in my mind, that were no policy.
The King will labour still to save his life,
The commons haply rise to save his life;
And yet we have but trivial argument
More than mistrust that shows him worthy death.
