This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find
The harm of unscanned swiftness, will too late
Tie leaden pounds to’s heels. Proceed by process,

And sack great Rome with Romans. BRUTUS If it were so? SICINIUS (to Menenius) What do ye talk? Have we not had a taste of his obedience:
Our aediles smote, ourselves resisted? Come.
