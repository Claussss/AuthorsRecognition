CASSIO Where are they? Here at the door. I pray you call them in. CASSIO I’ll do’t, but it dislikes me. If I can fasten but one cup upon him,
With that which he hath drunk tonight already
He’ll be as full of quarrel and offence
As my young mistress’ dog. Now my sick fool Roderigo,
Whom love hath turned almost the wrong side out,
To Desdemona hath tonight caroused
Potations pottle-deep, and he’s to watch.
Three else of Cyprus—noble swelling spirits
That hold their honours in a wary distance,
The very elements of this warlike isle—
Have I tonight flustered with flowing cups,
And they watch too. Now ’mongst this flock of
drunkards
Am I to put our Cassio in some action
That may offend the isle.
