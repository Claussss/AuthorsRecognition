A cry within of women What is that noise? It is the cry of women, my good lord. I have almost forgot the taste of fears.
The time has been my senses would have cooled
To hear a night-shriek, and my fell of hair
Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
As life were inâ€™t. I have supped full with horrors.
Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts,
Cannot once start me.
