FLUELLEN There is one goat for you. (He strikes Pistol) Will you be so good, scald knave, as eat it? PISTOL Base Trojan, thou shalt die. FLUELLEN You say very true, scald knave, when God’s will is. I will desire you to live in the mean time, and eat your victuals. Come, there is sauce for it. (He strikes him) You called me yesterday ‘mountain-squire’, but I will make you today a ‘squire of low degree’. I pray you, fall to. If you can mock a leek you can eat a leek.
