PALAMON Now, honest keeper? Lord Arcite, you must presently to th’ Duke.
The cause I know not yet. ARCITE I am ready, keeper. Prince Palamon, I must a while bereave you
Of your fair cousin’s company. Exeunt Arcite and the Jailer And me, too, Even when you please, of life. Why is he sent for?
It may be he shall marry her—he’s goodly,
And like enough the Duke hath taken notice
Both of his blood and body. But his falsehood!
Why should a friend be treacherous? If that
Get him a wife so noble and so fair,
Let honest men ne’er love again. Once more
I would but see this fair one. Bless
And fruit and flowers more blessed, that still blossom
As her bright eyes shine on ye! Would I were,
For all the fortune of my life hereafter,
Yon little tree, yon blooming apricot—
How I would spread and fling my wanton arms
In at her window! I would bring her fruit
Fit for the gods to feed on; youth and pleasure
Still as she tasted should be doubled on her;
And if she be not heavenly, I would make her
So near the gods in nature they should fear her—
