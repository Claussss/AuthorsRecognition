Enter King Edward, Richard Duke of Gloucester, George Duke of Clarence, and the Lady Gray 
KING EDWARD Brother of Gloucester, at Saint Albans field
This ladyâ€™s husband, Sir Richard Gray, was slain,
His lands then seized on by the conqueror.
Her suit is now to repossess those lands,
Which we in justice cannot well deny,
Because in quarrel of the house of York
The worthy gentleman did lose his life.
