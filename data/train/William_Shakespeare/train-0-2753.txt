KING EDWARD Thanks, Percy, for thy news, with all my heart!
What was he took him prisoner in the field? A squire, my lord. John Copland is his name,
Who, since entreated by her majesty,
Denies to make surrender of his prize
To any but unto your grace aloneâ€”
Whereat the Queen is grievously displeased.
