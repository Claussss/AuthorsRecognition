ORSINO Still so cruel? OLIVIA Still so constant, lord. What, to perverseness? You uncivil lady,
To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars
My soul the faithfull‘st off’rings hath breathed out
That e’er devotion tendered—what shall I do? Even what it please my lord that shall become him. Why should I not, had I the heart to do it,
Like to th’ Egyptian thief, at point of death
Kill what I love—a savage jealousy
That sometime savours nobly. But hear me this:
Since you to non-regardance cast my faith,
And that I partly know the instrument
That screws me from my true place in your favour,
Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still.
But this your minion, whom I know you love,
And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,
Him will I tear out of that cruel eye
Where he sits crowned in his master’s spite.
(To Viola) Come, boy, with me. My thoughts are ripe
in mischief.
I’ll sacrifice the lamb that I do love
To spite a raven’s heart within a dove.
