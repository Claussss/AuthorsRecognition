But penetrable to your kind entreats,
Albeit against my conscience and my soul. Enter Buckingham and the rest Cousin of Buckingham, and sage, grave men,
Since you will buckle fortune on my back,
To bear her burden, wheâ€™er I will or no,
I must have patience to endure the load.
But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach
Attend the sequel of your imposition,
Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
From all the impure blots and stains thereof;
For God doth know, and you may partly see,
How far I am from the desire of this.
