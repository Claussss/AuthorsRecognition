Make choice, then. I cannot, sir. They are both too excellent.
For me, a hair shall never fall of these men. HIPPOLYTA to Theseus What will become of ’em? Thus I ordain it, And by mine honour once again it stands,
Or both shall die. (To Palamon and Arcite) You shall
both to your country,
And each within this month, accompanied
With three fair knights, appear again in this place,
In which I’ll plant a pyramid; and whether,
Before us that are here, can force his cousin,
By fair and knightly strength, to touch the pillar,
He shall enjoy her; the other lose his head,
And all his friends; nor shall he grudge to fall,
Nor think he dies with interest in this lady.
Will this content ye?
