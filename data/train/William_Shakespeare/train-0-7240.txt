A maiden battle, then? O I perceive you. Enter Diomedes Here is Sir Diomed.â€”Go, gentle knight,
Stand by our Ajax. As you and Lord Aeneas
Consent upon the order of their fight,
So be it: either to the uttermost
Or else a breath. Exeunt Ajax, Diomedes, Hector, and Aeneas The combatants being kin Half stints their strife before their strokes begin. ULYSSES They are opposed already.
