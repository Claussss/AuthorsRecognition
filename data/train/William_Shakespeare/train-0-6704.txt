This is too heavy; let me see another. HAMLET (taking a foil) This likes me well. These foils have all a length? OSRIC Ay, my good lord. Hamlet and Laertes prepare to play KING CLAUDIUS (to attendants) Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
Let all the battlements their ordnance fire.
The King shall drink to Hamlet’s better breath,
And in the cup an union shall he throw
Richer than that which four successive kings
In Denmark’s crown have worn. Give me the cups,
And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,
‘Now the King drinks to Hamlet’.
