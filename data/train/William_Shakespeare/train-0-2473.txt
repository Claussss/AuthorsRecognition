The sweets we wish for turn to loathed sours
Even in the moment that we call them ours. â€˜Unruly blasts wait on the tender spring,
Unwholesome weeds take root with precious flowers,
The adder hisses where the sweet birds sing,
What virtue breeds, iniquity devours.
We have no good that we can say is ours
