1.1
Enter the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Ely 
CANTERBURY My lord, I’ll tell you. That self bill is urged
Which in th’eleventh year of the last king’s reign
Was like, and had indeed against us passed,
But that the scrambling and unquiet time
Did push it out of farther question. But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?
