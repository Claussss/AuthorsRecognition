ROMEO My nyas? JULIET What o’clock tomorrow Shall I send to thee? ROMEO By the hour of nine. I will not fail; ’tis twenty year till then.
I have forgot why I did call thee back. Let me stand here till thou remember it. I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
Rememb’ring how I love thy company.
