AUSTRIA (kissing Arthur) Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss
As seal to this indenture of my love: 20
That to my home I will no more return
Till Angers and the right thou hast in France,
Together with that pale, that white-faced shore,
Whose foot spurns back the oceanâ€™s roaring tides
And coops from other lands her islanders, 25
Even till that England, hedged in with the main,
That water-wall
And confident from foreign purposes,
Even till that utmost corner of the west
Salute thee for her king. Till then, fair boy,
Will I not think of home, but follow arms.
