Not altogether so. I looked not for you yet, nor am provided
For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;
For those that mingle reason with your passion
Must be content to think you old, and so—
But she knows what she does. Is this well spoken? I dare avouch it, sir. What, fifty followers?
Is it not well? What should you need of more,
Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger
Speak ‘gainst so great a number? How in one house
Should many people under two commands
Hold amity? ’Tis hard, almost impossible.
