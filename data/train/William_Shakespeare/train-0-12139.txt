Alas,
 I have no voice, sir, to confirm her that way. That’s all one, if ye make a noise.
If she entreat again, do anything—
Lie with her if she ask you. Ho there, Doctor. Yes, in the way of cure. But first, by your leave,
 I’th’ way of honesty. That’s but a niceness—
 Ne’er cast your child away for honesty.
Cure her first this way, then if she will be honest,
She has the path before her.
