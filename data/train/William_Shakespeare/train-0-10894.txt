I pray you, sir, take patience. I have hope
You less know how to value her desert
Than she to scant her duty. Say, how is that? I cannot think my sister in the least
Would fail her obligation. If, sir, perchance
She have restrained the riots of your followers,
â€™Tis on such ground and to such wholesome end
As clears her from all blame.
