Madam, I am most apt t’embrace your offer.
(To Viola) Your master quits you, and for your service
done him
So much against the mettle of your sex,
So far beneath your soft and tender breeding,
And since you called me master for so long,
Here is my hand. You shall from this time be
Your master’s mistress.
