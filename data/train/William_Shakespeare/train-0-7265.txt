PATROCLUS Out, gall! THERSITES Finch egg! My sweet Patroclus, I am thwarted quite
From my great purpose in tomorrow’s battle.
Here is a letter from Queen Hecuba,
A token from her daughter, my fair love,
Both taxing me, and gaging me to keep
An oath that I have sworn. I will not break it.
Fall, Greeks; fail, fame; honour, or go or stay.
My major vow lies here; this I’ll obey.—
Come, come, Thersites, help to trim my tent.
This night in banqueting must all be spent.—
Away, Patroclus. Exeunt Achilles and Patroclus
