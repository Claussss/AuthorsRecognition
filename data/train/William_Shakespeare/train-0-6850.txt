SIR TOBY Come thy ways, Signor Fabian. FABIAN Nay, I’ll come. If I lose a scruple of this sport let me be boiled to death with melancholy. SIR TOBY Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame? FABIAN I would exult, man. You know he brought me out o’ favour with my lady about a bear-baiting here.
