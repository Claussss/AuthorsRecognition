Sans ‘sans’, I pray you. Yet I have a trick Of the old rage. Bear with me, I am sick.
I’ll leave it by degrees. Soft, let us see.
Write ‘Lord have mercy on us’ on those three.
They are infected, in their hearts it lies.
They have the plague, and caught it of your eyes.
These lords are visited, you are not free;
For the Lord’s tokens on you do I see.
