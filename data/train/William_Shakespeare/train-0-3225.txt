Construe my speeches better, if you may. Then wish me better. I will give you leave. We came to visit you, and purpose now
To lead you to our court. Vouchsafe it, then. This field shall hold me, and so hold your vow.
Nor God nor I delights in perjured men. Rebuke me not for that which you provoke.
The virtue of your eye must break my oath.
