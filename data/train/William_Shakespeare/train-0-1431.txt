RICHARD PLANTAGENET Now Somerset, where is your argument? Here in my scabbard, meditating that
Shall dye your white rose in a bloody red. RICHARD PLANTAGENET Meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses,
For pale they look with fear, as witnessing
The truth on our side. SOMERSET No, Plantagenet, â€˜Tis not for fear, but anger, that thy cheeks
Blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses,
And yet thy tongue will not confess thy error.
