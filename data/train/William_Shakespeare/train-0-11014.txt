Exit with the body The King is mad. How stiff is my vile sense,
That I stand up and have ingenious feeling
Of my huge sorrows! Better I were distraught,
So should my thoughts be severed from my griefs, Drum afar off And woes by wrong imaginations lose
The knowledge of themselves. Enter Edgar Give me your hand.
