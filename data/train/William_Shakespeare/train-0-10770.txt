Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;
Dearer than eyesight, space, and liberty;
Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare,
No less than life; with grace, health, beauty, honour;
As much as child eâ€™er loved or father found;
A love that makes breath poor and speech unable.
Beyond all manner of so much I love you.
