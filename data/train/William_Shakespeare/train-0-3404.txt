Ah, Richard! With the eyes of heavy mind
I see thy glory, like a shooting star,
Fall to the base earth from the firmament.
Thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west,
Witnessing storms to come, woe, and unrest.
Thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes,
And crossly to thy good all fortune goes. Exit 3.1
Enter Bolingbroke Duke of Lancaster and Hereford, the Duke of York, the Earl of Northumberland, Lord Ross, Harry Percy, and Lord Willoughby
