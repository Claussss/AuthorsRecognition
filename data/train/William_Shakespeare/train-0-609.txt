Iâ€™ll have no bigger. This doth fit the time,
And gentlewomen wear such caps as these. When you are gentle you shall have one, too,
And not till then. HORTENSIO (aside) That will not be in haste. Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak,
And speak I will. I am no child, no babe.
Your betters have endured me say my mind,
And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.
My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,
Or else my heart concealing it will break,
And rather than it shall I will be free
Even to the uttermost as I please in words.
