Full merrily the humble-bee doth sing Till he hath lost his honey and his sting, And being once subdued in arm Sweet honey and sweet notes together fail. Good traders in the flesh, set this in your painted cloths: As many as be here of Pandar’s hall,
Your eyes, half out, weep out at Pandar’s fall.
Or if you cannot weep, yet give some groans,
Though not for me, yet for your aching bones.
Brethren and sisters of the hold-door trade,
Some two months hence my will shall here be made.
It should be now, but that my fear is this:
Some galled goose of Winchester would hiss.
Till then I’ll sweat and seek about for eases,
And at that time bequeath you my diseases. Exit
