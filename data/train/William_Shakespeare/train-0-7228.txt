Exeunt Troilus, Cressida, and Diomedes A trumpet sounds Hark, Hector’s trumpet. How have we spent this morning?
The Prince must think me tardy and remiss,
That swore to ride before him in the field. ‘Tis Troilus’ fault. Come, come to field with him. DEIPHOBUS Let us make ready straight. Yea, with a bridegroom’s fresh alacrity
Let us address to tend on Hector’s heels.
The glory of our Troy doth this day lie
On his fair worth and single chivalry. Exeunt
