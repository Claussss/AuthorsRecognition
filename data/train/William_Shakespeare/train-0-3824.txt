We still have known thee for a holy man.
Where’s Romeo’s man? What can he say to this? 270 I brought my master news of Juliet’s death,
And then in post he came from Mantua
To this same place, to this same monument.
This letter he early bid me give his father,
And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
If I departed not and left him there.
