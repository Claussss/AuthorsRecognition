Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol? Madam, not yet. I go to take my stand
To see him pass on to the Capitol. Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not? That I have, lady. If it will please Caesar
To be so good to Caesar as to hear me,
I shall beseech him to befriend himself. Why, knowâ€™st thou any harms intended towards him?
