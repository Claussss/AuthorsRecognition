PRINCE JOHN, GLOUCESTER, and CLARENCE We hope no other from your majesty. PRINCE HARRY You all look strangely on me, (to Lord Chief Justice)
and you most.
You are, I think, assured I love you not. LORD CHIEF JUSTICE I am assured, if I be measured rightly,
Your majesty hath no just cause to hate me. PRINCE HARRY
