Enter Julia and Lucetta But say, Lucetta, now we are alone—
Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love? Ay, madam, so you stumble not unheedfully. Of all the fair resort of gentlemen
That every day with parle encounter me,
In thy opinion which is worthiest love? Please you repeat their names, I’ll show my mind
According to my shallow simple skill.
