LORD CHAMBERLAIN Now God incense him, And let him cry ‘Ha!’ louder. But, my lord, When returns Cranmer? He is returned in his opinions, which
Have satisfied the King for his divorce,
Together with all famous colleges,
Almost, in Christendom. Shortly, I believe,
His second marriage shall be published, and
Her coronation. Katherine no more
Shall be called ‘Queen’, but ‘Princess Dowager’,
And ‘widow to Prince Arthur’.
