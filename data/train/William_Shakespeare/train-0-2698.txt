KING OF FRANCE Well said, young Philippe! To an attendant
That we may cheer our stomachs with repast
To look our foes more sternly in the face. Bread and wine are brought forth. The battle is heard afar off. The King and Prince Philippe sup Now is begun the heavy day at sea.
Fight, Frenchmen, fight! Be like the field of bears
When they defend their younglings in their caves.
Steer, angry Nemesis, the happy helm
That with the sulphur battles of your rage
The English fleet may be dispersed and sunk.
