What does he mean? Since death of my dearâ€™st mother
It did not speak before. All solemn things
Should answer solemn accidents. The matter?
Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys
Is jollity for apes and grief for boys.
Is Cadwal mad? Enter from the cave Arviragus with Innogen, dead, bearing her in his arms
