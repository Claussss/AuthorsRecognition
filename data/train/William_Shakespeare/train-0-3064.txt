MOTE If she be made of white and red
Her faults will neâ€™er be known,
For blushing cheeks by faults are bred
And fears by pale white shown.
Then if she fear or be to blame,
By this you shall not know;
For still her cheeks possess the same
Which native she doth owe. A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of white and red.
