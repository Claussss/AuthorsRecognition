The remedy indeed to do me good
Is to let forth my foul defiled blood. ‘Poor hand, why quiver’st thou at this decree?
Honour thyself to rid me of this shame,
For if I die, my honour lives in thee,
But if I live, thou liv’st in my defame.
Since thou couldst not defend thy loyal dame, And wast afeard to scratch her wicked foe,
Kill both thyself and her for yielding so.’
