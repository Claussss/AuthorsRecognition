EVANS Sir John Falstaff, serve Got and leave your desires, and fairies will not pinse you. FORD Well said, Fairy Hugh. EVANS And leave you your jealousies too, I pray you. FORD I will never mistrust my wife again till thou art able to woo her in good English. SIR JOHN Have I laid my brain in the sun and dried it, that it wants matter to prevent so gross o‘er-reaching as this? Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too? Shall I have a coxcomb of frieze ? ’Tis time I were choked with a piece of toasted cheese.
