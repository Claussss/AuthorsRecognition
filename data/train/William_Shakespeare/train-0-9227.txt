Macduff is missing, and your noble son. ROSS (to Siward) Your son, my lord, has paid a soldierâ€™s debt.
He only lived but till he was a man,
The which no sooner had his prowess confirmed
In the unshrinking station where he fought,
But like a man he died. Then he is dead? Ay, and brought off the field. Your cause of sorrow
Must not be measured by his worth, for then
It hath no end.
