Casca will tell us what the matter is. CAESAR Antonio. ANTONY Caesar. Let me have men about me that are fat,
Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep a-nights.
Yon Cassius has a lean and hungry look.
He thinks too much. Such men are dangerous. Fear him not, Caesar, heâ€™s not dangerous.
He is a noble Roman, and well given.
