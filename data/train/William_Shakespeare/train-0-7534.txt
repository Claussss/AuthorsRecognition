 Upon the King At the foot of the effigy of King James I, before his Works (1616) Crowns have their compass; length of days, their date;
Triumphs, their tombs; felicity, her fate.
Of more than earth can earth make none partaker,
But knowledge makes the king most like his maker. 
 Epitaph on Himself
