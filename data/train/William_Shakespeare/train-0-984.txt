That is too much presumption on thy part;
But if thy arms be to no other end,
The King hath yielded unto thy demand:
The Duke of Somerset is in the Tower. Upon thine honour, is he prisoner? Upon mine honour, he is prisoner. Then, Buckingham, I do dismiss my powers.
Soldiers, I thank you all; disperse yourselves;
Meet me tomorrow in Saint Georgeâ€™s field.
You shall have pay and everything you wish.
