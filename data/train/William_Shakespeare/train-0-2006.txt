Fie, what an indirect and peevish course
Is this of hers !—Lord Cardinal, will your grace
Persuade the Queen to send the Duke of York
Unto his princely brother presently?—
If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,
And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce. My lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory
Can from his mother win the Duke of York,
Anon expect him. But if she’ be obdurate
To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid
We should infringe the sacred privilege
Of blessed sanctuary. Not for all this land
Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.
