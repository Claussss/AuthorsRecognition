PRINCE HARRY Thou liest : thou art not colted, thou art uncolted. SIR JOHN I prithee, good Prince Hal, help me to my horse, good king’s son. PRINCE HARRY Out, ye rogue, shall I be your ostler? SIR JOHN Hang thyself in thine own heir-apparent garters ! If I be ta’en, I’ll peach for this. An I have not ballads made on you all and sung to filthy tunes, let a cup of sack be my poison. When a jest is so forward, and afoot too ! I hate it.
