QUEEN MARGARET King Louis and Lady Bona, hear me speak
Before you answer Warwick. His demand
Springs not from Edward’s well-meant honest love,
But from deceit, bred by necessity.
For how can tyrants safely govern home
Unless abroad they purchase great alliance ?
To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice—
That Henry liveth still; but were he dead,
Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry’s son.
Look, therefore, Louis, that by this league and
marriage
Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour,
For though usurpers sway the rule a while,
Yet heav’ns are just and time suppresseth wrongs.
