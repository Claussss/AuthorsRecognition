That is as clear from this attaint of mine
As I ere this was pure to Collatine. ‘O unseen shame, invisible disgrace!
O unfelt sore, crest-wounding private scar!
Reproach is stamped in Collatinus’ face,
And Tarquin’s eye may read the mot afar,
How he in peace is wounded, not in war. Alas, how many bear such shameful blows,
Which not themselves but he that gives them knows!
