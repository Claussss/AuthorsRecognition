ISABELLA So. And his offence is so, as it appears,
Accountant to the law upon that pain. ISABELLA True. Admit no other way to save his life—
As I subscribe not that nor any other—
But, in the loss of question, that you his sister,
Finding yourself desired of such a person
Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,
Could fetch your brother from the manacles
Of the all-binding law, and that there were
No earthly mean to save him, but that either
You must lay down the treasures of your body
To this supposed, or else to let him suffer—
What would you do?
