Pretty bare, past compare,
Parts those plots which besots
still asunder.
It is meet naught but sweet
Should come near that so rare
’tis a wonder.
No mis-shape, no scape
Inferior to nature’s perfection;
No blot, no spot:
She’s beauty’s queen in election.
9 Whilst I dreamt, I, exempt
From all care, seemed to share
pleasure’s plenty;
But awake, care take—
For I find to my mind
pleasures scanty.
Therefore I will try
To compass my heart’s chief contenting.
To delay, some say,
In such a case causeth repenting.
