My kind Antonio,
I can no other answer make but thanks,
And thanks; and ever oft good turns
Are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay.
But were my worth as is my conscience firm,
You should find better dealing. Whatâ€™s to do?
Shall we go see the relics of this town? Tomorrow, sir. Best first go see your lodging.
