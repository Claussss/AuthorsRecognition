No, my good lord, therefore mistrust me not. KING RICHARD Where is thy power then? To beat him back,
Where be thy tenants and thy followers?
Are they not now upon the western shore,
Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships? No, my good lord, my friends are in the north. KING RICHARD Cold friends to me. What do they in the north,
When they should serve their sovereign in the west?
