FIRST KNIGHT What ending could be
 Of more content? O’er us the victors have
Fortune, whose title is as momentary
As to us death is certain—a grain of honour
They not o’erweigh us. SECOND KNIGHT Let us bid farewell, And with our patience anger tott’ring fortune,
Who at her certain’st reels. THIRD KNIGHT Come, who begins?
