Nor could she moralize his wanton sight
More than his eyes were opened to the light. He stories to her ears her husband’s fame
Won in the fields of fruitful Italy,
And decks with praises Collatine’s high name
Made glorious by his manly chivalry
With bruised arms and wreaths of victory. Her joy with heaved-up hand she doth express,
And wordless so greets heaven for his success.
