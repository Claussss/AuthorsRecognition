O, this will make my mother die with grief. 5 KING JOHN (to the Bastard) Cousin, away for England! Haste before,
And ere our coming, see thou shake the bags
Of hoarding abbots. The fat ribs of peace
Must by the hungry now be fed upon.
Imprisoned angels set at liberty. 10
Use our commission in his utmost force.
