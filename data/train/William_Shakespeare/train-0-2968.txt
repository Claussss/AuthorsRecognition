PINCH (aside to
Adriana) It is no shame. The fellow finds his vein,
And, yielding to him, humours well his frenzy. ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS (to Adriana) Thou hast suborned the goldsmith to arrest me. Alas, I sent you money to redeem you,
By Dromio here, who came in haste for it. DROMIO OF EPHESUS Money by me ? Heart and good will you might,
But surely, master, not a rag of money.
