If he were rich, what is Sir Thomas More,
That all this while hath been Lord Chancellor? Say ye so, Master Lieutenant? What do you think
A man that with my time had held my place
Might purchase? Perhaps, my lord, two thousand pound a year. Master Lieutenant, I protest to you,
I never had the means in all my life
To purchase one poor hundred pound a year.
I think I am the poorest chancellor
That ever was in England, though I could wish,
For credit of the place, that my estate were better.
