FIRST OFFICER Orsino, this is that Antonio
That took the Phoenix and her freight from Candy,
And this is he that did the Tiger board
When your young nephew Titus lost his leg.
Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state,
In private brabble did we apprehend him. He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side,
But in conclusion put strange speech upon me.
I know not what â€™twas but distraction.
