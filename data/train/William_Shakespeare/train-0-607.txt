KATHERINE I pray you, let it stand. The poorest service is repaid with thanks,
And so shall mine before you touch the meat. KATHERINE I thank you, sir. Signor Petruccio, fie, you are to blame.
Come, Mistress Kate, I’ll bear you company. PETRUCCIO (aside) Eat it up all, Hortensio, if thou lov’st me.
(To Katherine) Much good do it unto thy gentle heart.
Kate, eat apace; and now, my honey love,
Will we return unto thy father’s house,
And revel it as bravely as the best,
With silken coats, and caps, and golden rings,
With ruffs, and cuffs, and farthingales, and things,
With scarves, and fans, and double change of
bravery,
With amber bracelets, beads, and all this knavery.
What, hast thou dined? The tailor stays thy leisure,
To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure.
