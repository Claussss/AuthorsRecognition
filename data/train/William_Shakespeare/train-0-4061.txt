ARTHUR (to Austria) God shall forgive you C
The rather that you give his offspring life,
Shadowing their right under your wings of war.
I give you welcome with a powerless hand, 15
But with a heart full of unstained love.
Welcome before the gates of Angers, Duke. A noble boy. Who would not do thee right?
