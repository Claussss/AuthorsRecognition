ANTIOCHUS Prince Pericles— That would be son to great Antiochus. Before thee stands this fair Hesperides,
With golden fruit, but dang’rous to be touched, He gestures towards the heads For death-like dragons here affright thee hard. He gestures towards his daughter Her heav‘n-like face enticeth thee to view
Her countless glory, which desert must gain;
And which without desert, because thine eye
Presumes to reach, all the whole heap must die.
Yon sometimes famous princes, like thyself
Drawn by report, advent’rous by desire,
Tell thee with speechless tongues and semblants
bloodless
That without covering save yon field of stars
Here they stand, martyrs slain in Cupid’s wars,
And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist
From going on death’s net, whom none resist.
