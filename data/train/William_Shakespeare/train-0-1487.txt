We have been guided by thee hitherto,
And of thy cunning had no diffidence.
One sudden foil shall never breed distrust. BASTARD (to Joan) Search out thy wit for secret policies,
And we will make thee famous through the world. ALENto Joan) Weâ€™ll set thy statue in some holy place
And have thee reverenced like a blessed saint.
Employ thee then, sweet virgin, for our good.
