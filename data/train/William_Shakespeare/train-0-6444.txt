The Ghost beckons Hamlet It wafts me still. (To the Ghost) Go on, I’ll follow thee. You shall not go, my lord. Hold off your hand. Be ruled. You shall not go. My fate cries out,
And makes each petty artere in this body
As hardy as the Nemean lion’s nerve. The Ghost beckons Hamlet Still am I called. Unhand me, gentlemen.
By heav’n, I’ll make a ghost of him that lets me.
I say, away! (To the Ghost) Go on, I’ll follow thee.
