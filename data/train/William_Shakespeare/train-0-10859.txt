Enter the Duke of Cornwall, Regan, and attendants How now, my noble friend? Since I came hither,
Which I can call but now, I have heard strange news. If it be true, all vengeance comes too short
Which can pursue th’offender. How dost, my lord? O madam, my old heart is cracked, it’s cracked. What, did my father’s godson seek your life?
He whom my father named, your Edgar?
