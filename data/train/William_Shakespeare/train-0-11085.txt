INNOGEN Nay, stay a little. Were you but riding forth to air yourself
Such parting were too petty. Look here, love:
This diamond was my motherâ€™s. Take it, heart; She gives him a ring But keep it till you woo another wife
When Innogen is dead. How, how? Another? You gentle gods, give me but this I have,
And cere up my embracements from a next
With bonds of death! Remain, remain thou here
