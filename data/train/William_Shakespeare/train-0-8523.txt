GONORIL What, Oswald, ho! Enter Oswald OSWALD Here, madam. What, have you writ this letter to my sister? OSWALD Yes, madam. Take you some company, and away to horse.
Inform her full of my particular fears,
And thereto add such reasons of your own
As may compact it more. Get you gone,
And after, your retinue.
