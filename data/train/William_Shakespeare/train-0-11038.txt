I’ll do’t, my lord. About it, and write ‘happy’ when thou’st done.
Mark, I say, instantly, and carry it so
As I have set it down. Exit the Captain Flourish. Enter the Duke of Albany, Goneril, Regan, drummer, trumpeter
and soldiers Sir, you have showed today your valiant strain,
And fortune led you well. You have the captives
Who were the opposites of this day’s strife.
I do require them of you, so to use them
As we shall find their merits and our safety
May equally determine.
