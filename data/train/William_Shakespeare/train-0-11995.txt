Fie, sir. You play the child extremely. I will love her,
I must, I ought to do so, and I dare—
And all this justly. O, that now, that now Thy false self and thy friend had but this fortune—
To be one hour at liberty and grasp
Our good swords in our hands! I would quickly teach
thee
What ’twere to filch affection from another.
Thou art baser in it than a cutpurse.
Put but thy head out of this window more
And, as I have a soul, I’ll nail thy life to’t.
