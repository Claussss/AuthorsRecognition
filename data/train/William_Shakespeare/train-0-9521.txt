Not by a public minister of justice,
Nor by a hired knife; but that self hand
Which writ his honour in the acts it did
Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,
Splitted the heart. This is his sword;
I robbed his wound of it. Behold it stained
With his most noble blood. CAESAR (weeping) Look you, sad friends, The gods rebuke me; but it is a tidings
To wash the eyes of kings.
