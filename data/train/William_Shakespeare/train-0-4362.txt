Why, all the boys in Venice follow him,
Crying, ‘His stones, his daughter, and his ducats!’ Let good Antonio look he keep his day,
Or he shall pay for this. SALERIO Marry, well remembered. I reasoned with a Frenchman yesterday,
Who told me in the narrow seas that part
The French and English there miscarried
A vessel of our country, richly fraught.
I thought upon Antonio when he told me,
And wished in silence that it were not his.
