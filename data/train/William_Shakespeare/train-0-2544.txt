Wanting the spring that those shrunk pipes had fed,
Showed life imprisoned in a body dead. On this sad shadow Lucrece spends her eyes,
And shapes her sorrow to the beldameâ€™s woes,
Who nothing wants to answer her but cries
And bitter words to ban her cruel foes.
The painter was no god to lend her those,
