CORNWALL Leave him to my displeasure.— Edmund, keep you our sister company.
The revenges we are bound to take upon your traitorous
father are not fit for your beholding. Advise the Duke
where you are going, to a most festinate preparation;
we are bound to the like. Our posts shall be swift, and
intelligence betwixt us.—
Farewell, dear sister. Farewell, my lord of Gloucester.
