And were I not immortal, life were done
Between this heavenly and earthly sun. ‘Art thou obdurate, flinty, hard as steel?
Nay, more than flint, for stone at rain relenteth.
Art thou a woman’s son, and canst not feel
What ’tis to love, how want of love tormenteth? O, had thy mother borne so hard a mind,
She had not brought forth thee, but died unkind.
