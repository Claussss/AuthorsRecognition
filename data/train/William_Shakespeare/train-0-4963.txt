ANNE Good mother, do not marry me to yon fool. MISTRESS PAGE I mean it not; I seek you a better husband. MISTRESS QUICKLY aside to Anne Alas, I had rather be set quick i’th’ earth
And bowled to death with turnips. MISTRESS PAGE Come, trouble not yourself, good Master Fenton.
I will not be your friend nor enemy.
My daughter will I question how she loves you,
And as I find her, so am I affected.
Till then, farewell, sir. She must needs go in.
Her father will be angry.
