‘Go, get me hither paper, ink, and pen;
Yet save that labour, for I have them here.
What should I say? One of my husband’s men
Bid thou be ready by and by to bear
A letter to my lord, my love, my dear. Bid him with speed prepare to carry it;
The cause craves haste, and it will soon be writ.’ Her maid is gone, and she prepares to write,
First hovering o’er the paper with her quill.
Conceit and grief an eager combat fight;
What wit sets down is blotted straight with will;
This is too curious-good, this blunt and ill.
