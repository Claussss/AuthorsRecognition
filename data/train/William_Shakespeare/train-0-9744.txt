First give me trust the Count he is my husband,
And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken
Is so from word to word, and then you cannot,
By the good aid that I of you shall borrow,
Err in bestowing it. I should believe you, For you have showed me that which well approves
Youâ€™re great in fortune. Take this purse of gold,
