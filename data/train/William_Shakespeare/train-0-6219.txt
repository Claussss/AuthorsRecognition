Assuredly the thing is to be sold.
Go with me. If you like upon report
The soil, the profit, and this kind of life,
I will your very faithful feeder be,
And buy it with your gold right suddenly. Exeunt  2.5
Enter Amiens, Jaques, and other Lords dressed as foresters 
[AMIENS] (sings) Under the greenwood tree
Who loves to lie with me,
And turn his merry note
Unto the sweet birdâ€™s throat,
Come hither, come hither, come hither.
Here shall he see
No enemy
But winter and rough weather.
