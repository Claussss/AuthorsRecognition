Exeunt severally 
4.3
Enter Arthur Duke of Brittaine on the walls, disguised as a ship-boy The wall is high, and yet will I leap down.
Good ground, be pitiful, and hurt me not.
There’s few or none do know me; if they did,
This ship-boy’s semblance hath disguised me quite.
I am afraid, and yet I’ll venture it.
If I get down and do not break my limbs,
I’ll find a thousand shifts to get away.
As good to die and go, as die and stay.
