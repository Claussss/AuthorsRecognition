That eye my daughter lent her, ’tis most true. And I do with an eye of love requite her. The sight whereof I think you had from me,
From Claudio and the Prince. But what’s your will? Your answer, sir, is enigmatical.
But for my will, my will is your good will
May stand with ours this day to be conjoined
In the state of honourable marriage,
In which, good Friar, I shall desire your help.
