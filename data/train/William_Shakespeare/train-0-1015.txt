YORK (to Edward and Richard) How now, boys! Fortunate this fight hath been,
I hope, to us and ours for Englandâ€™s good
And our great honour, that so long we lost
Whilst faint-heart Henry did usurp our rights.
Of Salisbury, who can report of him?
That winter lion who in rage forgets
Aged contusions and all brush of time,
And, like a gallant in the brow of youth,
Repairs him with occasion. This happy day
Is not itself, nor have we won one foot
If Salisbury be lost.
