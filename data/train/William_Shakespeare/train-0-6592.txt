QUEEN GERTRUDE O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain! O, throw away the worser part of it,
And live the purer with the other half!
Good night—but go not to mine uncle’s bed.
Assume a virtue if you have it not.
Refrain tonight,
And that shall lend a kind of easiness
To the next abstinence. Once more, good night;
And when you are desirous to be blest,
I’ll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,
I do repent. But heaven hath pleased it so
To punish me with this, and this with me,
That I must be their scourge and minister.
I will bestow him, and will answer well
The death I gave him. So, again, good night.
I must be cruel only to be kind.
Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
