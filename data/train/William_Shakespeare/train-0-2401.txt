‘And how her hand, in my hand being locked,
Forced it to tremble with her loyal fear,
Which struck her sad, and then it faster rocked
Until her husband’s welfare she did hear,
Whereat she smiled with so sweet a cheer That had Narcissus seen her as she stood
Self-love had never drowned him in the flood.
