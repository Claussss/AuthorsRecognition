QUEEN GERTRUDE Hamlet, Hamlet! HORATIO (to Hamlet) Good my lord, be quiet. Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
Until my eyelids will no longer wag. QUEEN GERTRUDE O my son, what theme? I loved Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers
Could not, with all their quantity of love,
Make up my sum.â€”What wilt thou do for her?
