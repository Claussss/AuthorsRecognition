LADY MACBETH Come on, gentle my lord, Sleek oâ€™er your rugged looks, be bright and jovial
Among your guests tonight. So shall I, love, And so I pray be you. Let your remembrance
Apply to Banquo. Present him eminence
Both with eye and tongue; unsafe the while that we
Must lave our honours in these flattering streams
And make our faces visors to our hearts,
Disguising what they are.
