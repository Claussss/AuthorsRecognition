Enter the Duke of Aumerle DUCHESS OF YORK
Here comes my son Aumerle. Aumerle that was; But that is lost for being Richard’s friend,
And, madam, you must call him ’Rutland’ now.
I am in Parliament pledge for his truth
And lasting fealty to the new-made King. DUCHESS OF YORK Welcome, my son. Who are the violets now
That strew the green lap of the new-come spring?
