Be ruled by me; forget to think of her. O, teach me how I should forget to think! By giving liberty unto thine eyes.
Examine other beauties. ROMEO ’Tis the way To call hers, exquisite, in question more.
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies’ brows,
Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair.
He that is strucken blind cannot forget
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
What doth her beauty serve but as a note
Where I may read who passed that passing fair?
Farewell, thou canst not teach me to forget.
