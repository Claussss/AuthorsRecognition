E’en he that led you to this banquet shall
Taste to you all. (To the
jailer) Aha, my friend, my
friend,
Your gentle daughter gave me freedom once;
You’ll see’t done now for ever. Pray, how does she?
I heard she was not well; her kind of ill
Gave me some sorrow. Sir, she’s well restored
 And to be married shortly.
