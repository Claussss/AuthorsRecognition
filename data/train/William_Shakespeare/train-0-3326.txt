LORD MARSHAL (to an officer) Go bear this lance to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk. An officer bears a lance to Mowbray FIRST HERALD Harry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby
Stands here for God, his sovereign, and himself,
On pain to be found false and recreant,
To prove the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray,
A traitor to his God, his king, and him,
And dares him to set forward to the fight.
