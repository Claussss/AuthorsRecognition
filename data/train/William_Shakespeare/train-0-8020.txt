PROVOST A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless of whatâ€™s past, present, or to come; insensible of mortality, and desperately mortal. DUKE He wants advice. PROVOST He will hear none. He hath evermore had the liberty of the prison. Give him leave to escape hence, he would not. Drunk many times a day, if not many days entirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him as if to carry him to execution, and showed him a seeming warrant for it; it hath not moved him at all.
