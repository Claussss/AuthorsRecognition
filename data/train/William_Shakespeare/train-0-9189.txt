DOCTOR I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive no truth in your report. When was it she last walked? GENTLEWOMAN Since his majesty went into the field I have seen her rise from her bed, throw her nightgown upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it, write uponâ€™t, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to bed, yet all this while in a most fast sleep.
