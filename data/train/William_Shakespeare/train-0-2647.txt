How near, then, shall I be to remedy? COUNTESS OF SALISBURY As near, my liege, as all my woman’s power
Can pawn itself to buy thy remedy. KING EDWARD If thou speak’st true, then have I my redress.
Engage thy power to redeem my joys,
And I am joyful, Countess; else I die. COUNTESS OF SALISBURY I will, my liege.
