JAILER’S DAUGHTER How do you like him? He’s a very fair one. JAILER’S DAUGHTER You never saw him dance? JAILER’S DAUGHTER I have, often. He dances very finely, very comely,
And, for a jig, come cut and long-tail to him,
He turns ye like a top. That’s fine, indeed. JAILER’S DAUGHTER He’ll dance the morris twenty mile an hour,
And that will founder the best hobbyhorse,
If I have any skill, in all the parish—
And gallops to the tune of ‘Light o’ love’.
What think you of this horse?
