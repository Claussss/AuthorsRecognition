THIRD HERALD I go. Exit PRINCE OF WALES How confident their strength and number makes them!
Now, Audley, sound those silver wings of thine,
And let those milk-white messengers of time
Show thy timeâ€™s learning in this dangerous time.
Thyself art bruised and bit with many broils,
And stratagems fore-past with iron pens
Are texted in thine honourable face.
Thou art a married man in this distress,
But danger woos me as a blushing maid.
Teach me an answer to this perilous time.
