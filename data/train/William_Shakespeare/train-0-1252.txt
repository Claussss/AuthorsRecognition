Your grace hath still been famed for virtuous,
And now may seem as wise as virtuous
By spying and avoiding fortune’s malice,
For few men rightly temper with the stars.
Yet in this one thing let me blame your grace:
For choosing me when Clarence is in place. GEORGE OF CLARENCE No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway,
To whom the heav’ns in thy nativity
Adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown,
As likely to be blest in peace and war.
And therefore I yield thee my free consent.
