Now, lords, take leave until we meet again,
Whereâ€™er it be, in heaven or in earth. Brother, give me thy hand; and, gentle Warwick,
Let me embrace thee in my weary arms.
I, that did never weep, now melt with woe
That winter should cut off our springtime so. Away, away! Once more, sweet lords, farewell.
