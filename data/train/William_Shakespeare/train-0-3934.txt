Why should he stay whom love doth press to go? What love could press Lysander from my side? Lysander’s love, that would not let him bide:
Fair Helena, who more engilds the night
Than all yon fiery O’s and eyes of light.
Why seek’st thou me? Could not this make thee know
The hate I bare thee made me leave thee so?
