I would the state of time had first been whole
Ere he by sickness had been visited.
His health was never better worth than now. Sick now? Droop now? This sickness doth infect
The very life-blood of our enterprise.
â€™Tis catching hither, even to our camp.
He writes me here that inward sickness stays him,
And that his friends by deputation
Could not so soon be drawn; nor did he think it meet
To lay so dangerous and dear a trust
On any soul removed but on his own.
Yet doth he give us bold advertisement
That with our small conjunction we should on,
To see how fortune is disposed to us;
For, as he writes, there is no quailing now,
Because the King is certainly possessed 40
Of all our purposes. What say you to it?
