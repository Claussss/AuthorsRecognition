PANDARUS Walk here i’th’ orchard. I’ll bring her straight. I am giddy. Expectation whirls me round.
Th‘imaginary relish is so sweet
That it enchants my sense. What will it be
When that the wat’ry palates taste indeed
Love
Swooning destruction, or some joy too fine,
Too subtle-potent, tuned too sharp in sweetness
For the capacity of my ruder powers.
I fear it much, and I do fear besides
That I shall lose distinction in my joys,
As doth a battle when they charge on heaps
The enemy flying.
