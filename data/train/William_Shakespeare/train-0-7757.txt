Be brief, my lord, for we are limited
Unto an hour. Unto an hour? ’Tis well. The bell, earth’s thunder, soon shall toll my knell. LADY MORE (kneeling) Dear loving husband, if you respect not me,
Yet think upon your daughters. MORE (pondering to himself) Wife, stand up. I have bethought me;
And I’ll now satisfy the King’s good pleasure.
