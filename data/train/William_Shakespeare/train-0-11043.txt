An interlude! Thou art armed, Gloucester. Let the trumpet sound.
If none appear to prove upon thy person
Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,
There is my pledge. He
throws down a
glove Iâ€™ll make it on thy heart, Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
Than I have here proclaimed thee. REGAN Sick, O sick!
