Bring me a stool. A stool is brought (To Simpcox) Now, sirrah, if you mean
To save yourself from whipping, leap me oâ€™er
This stool and run away. Alas, master, I am not able even to stand alone.
 You go about to torture me in vain. Enter a Beadle with whips Well, sirrah, we must have you find your legs.
(To the Beadle) Whip him till he leap over that same
stool.
