Badly, I fear. How fares your majesty? This fever that hath troubled me so long
Lies heavy on me. O, my heart is sick! Enter a Messenger My lord, your valiant kinsman Falconbridge
Desires your majesty to leave the field,
And send him word by me which way you go. Tell him toward Swineshead, to the abbey there.
