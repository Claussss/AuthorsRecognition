FIRST WATCHMAN How if a will not stand? DOGBERRY Why then take no note of him, but let him go, and presently call the rest of the watch together, and thank God you are rid of a knave. VERGES If he will not stand when he is bidden he is none of the Prince’s subjects. DOGBERRY True, and they are to meddle with none but the Prince’s subjects.—You shall also make no noise in the streets, for for the watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be endured.
