Ladies, a general welcome from his grace
Salutes ye all. This night he dedicates
To fair content and you. None here, he hopes,
In all this noble bevy, has brought with her
One care abroad. He would have all as merry
As feast, good company, good wine, good welcome
Can make good people. Enter the Lord Chamberlain, Lord Sands, and Sir Thomas Lovell
