FOOL Winter’s not gone yet if the wild geese fly that way. Do make their children blind,
But fathers that bear bags
Shall see their children kind.
Fortune, that arrant whore,
Ne’er turns the key to th’ poor. But for all this thou shalt have as many dolours for
thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year.
