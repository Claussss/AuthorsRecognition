He gives him the paper SECOND GENTLEMAN I thank you, sir. Had I not known those customs,
I should have been beholden to your paper.
But I beseech you, what’s become of Katherine,
The Princess Dowager? How goes her business? FIRST GENTLEMAN That I can tell you too. The Archbishop
Of Canterbury, accompanied with other
Learned and reverend fathers of his order,
Held a late court at Dunstable, six miles off
From Ampthill, where the Princess lay; to which
She was often cited by them, but appeared not.
And, to be short, for not appearance, and
The King’s late scruple, by the main assent
Of all these learned men, she was divorced,
And the late marriage made of none effect,
Since which she was removed to Kimbolton,
Where she remains now sick.
