NICANOR There hath been in Rome strange insurrections, the people against the senators, patricians, and nobles. ADRIAN Hath been?â€”is it ended then? Our state thinks not so. They are in a most warlike preparation, and hope to come upon them in the heat of their division. NICANOR The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing would make it flame again, for the nobles receive so to heart the banishment of that worthy Coriolanus that they are in a ripe aptness to take all power from the people, and to pluck from them their tribunes for ever. This lies glowing, I can tell you, and is almost mature for the violent breaking out.
