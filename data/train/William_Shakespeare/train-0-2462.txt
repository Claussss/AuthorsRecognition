Frantic with grief, thus breathes she forth her spite
Against the unseen secrecy of night: ‘O comfort-killing night, image of hell,
Dim register and notary of shame,
Black stage for tragedies and murders fell,
Vast sin-concealing chaos, nurse of blame!
Blind muffled bawd, dark harbour for defame, Grim cave of death, whisp’ring conspirator
With close-tongued treason and the ravisher!
