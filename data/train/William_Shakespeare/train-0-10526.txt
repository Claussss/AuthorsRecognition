FIRST LADY Why, my sweet lord? You’ll kiss me hard, and speak to me as if
I were a baby still. (To Second Lady) I love you better. SECOND LADY And why so, my lord? Not for because Your brows are blacker—yet black brows they say
Become some women best, so that there be not
Too much hair there, but in a semicircle,
Or a half-moon made with a pen.
