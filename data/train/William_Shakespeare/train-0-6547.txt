OPHELIA ’Tis brief, my lord. HAMLET As woman’s love. Enter the Player King and his Queen PLAYER KING Full thirty times hath Phoebus’ cart gone round
Neptune
And thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheen
About the world have times twelve thirties been
Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands
Unite commutual in most sacred bands.
