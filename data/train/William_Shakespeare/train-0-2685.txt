She moves away from the King kneeling
Here, by my side, doth hang my wedding knives. She reveals two knives Take thou the one, She offers a knife to the King and with it kill thy Queen, And learn by me to find her where she lies;
And with this other She turns the other knife on herself Iâ€™ll dispatch my love,
