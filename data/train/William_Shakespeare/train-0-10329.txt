Must I go show them my unbarb
Must I with my base tongue give to my noble heart
A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do’t.
Yet were there but this single plot to lose,
This mould of Martius they to dust should grind it
And throw’t against the wind. To th’ market-place.
You have put me now to such a part which never
I shall discharge to th’ life.
