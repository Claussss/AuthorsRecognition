Thanks, noble Titus, father of my life.
How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts
Rome shall record; and when I do forget
The least of these unspeakable deserts,
Romans, forget your fealty to me. TITUS (to Tamora) Now, madam, are you prisoner to an emperor,
To him that for your honour and your state
Will use you nobly, and your followers.
