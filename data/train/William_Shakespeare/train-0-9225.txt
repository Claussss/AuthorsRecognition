Then yield thee, coward, And live to be the show and gaze o‘th’ time.
We’ll have thee as our rarer monsters are,
Painted upon a pole, and underwrit
‘Here may you see the tyrant.’ I will not yield To kiss the ground before young Malcolm’s feet,
And to be baited with the rabble’s curse.
Though Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinane,
And thou opposed being of no woman born,
Yet I will try the last. Before my body
I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,
And damned be him that first cries ‘Hold, enough!’
