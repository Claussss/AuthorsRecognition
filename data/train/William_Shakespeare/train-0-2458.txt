Evâ€™n in this thought through the dark night he
stealeth,
A captive victor that hath lost in gain,
Bearing away the wound that nothing healeth,
The scar that will, despite of cure, remain;
Leaving his spoil perplexed in greater pain. She bears the load of lust he left behind,
And he the burden of a guilty mind.
