DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Many a man would take you at your word,
And go indeed, having so good a mean. Exit ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,
When I am dull with care and melancholy,
Lightens my humour with his merry jests.
What, will you walk with me about the town,
And then go to my inn and dine with me?
