Titania sleeps SECOND FAIRY Hence, away. Now all is well.
One aloof stand sentinel. Exeunt all but Titania  What thou seest when thou dost wake,
Do it for thy true love take;
Love and languish for his sake.
Be it ounce, or cat, or bear,
Pard, or boar with bristled hair,
In thy eye that shall appear
When thou wakâ€™st, it is thy dear.
Wake when some vile thing is near. Exit
