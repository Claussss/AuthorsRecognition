FLAVIUS Assurance bless your thoughts! And in some sort these wants of mine are crowned
That I account them blessings, for by these
Shall I try friends. You shall perceive how you
Mistake my fortunes. I am wealthy in my friends.â€”
Within there, Flaminius, Servilius! Enter Flaminius, Servilius, and a Third Servant
