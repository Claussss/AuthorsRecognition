It is too true an evil. Gone she is,
And what’s to come of my despised time
Is naught but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,
Where didst thou see her?—O unhappy girl!—
With the Moor, sayst thou?—Who would be a
father?—
How didst thou know ’twas she?—O, she deceives me
Past thought!—What said she to you? (To servants)
Get more tapers,
Raise all my kindred.
