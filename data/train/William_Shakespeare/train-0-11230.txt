No court, no father, nor no more ado
With that harsh, churlish, noble, simple nothing,
That Cloten, whose love suit hath been to me
As fearful as a siege. If not at court, Then not in Britain must you bide. Where then? Hath Britain all the sun that shines? Day, night,
Are they not but in Britain? I‘th’ world’s volume
Our Britain seems as of it but not in’t,
In a great pool a swan’s nest. Prithee, think
There’s livers out of Britain.
