He cannot come, my lord, he is grievous sick. Zounds, how has he the leisure to be sick
In such a jostling time? Who leads his power?
Under whose government come they along? His letters bears his mind, not I, my lord. Hotspur reads the letter I prithee tell me, doth he keep his bed? He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth;
And at the time of my departure thence
He was much feared by his physicians.
