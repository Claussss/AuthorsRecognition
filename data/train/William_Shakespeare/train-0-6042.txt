I heard him say Brutus and Cassius
Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome. Belike they had some notice of the people,
How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius.

Enter Cinna the poet I dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar,
And things unlucky charge my fantasy.
I have no will to wander forth of doors,
Yet something leads me forth.
