So please your grace, the Prologue is addressed. THESEUS Let him approach. Flourish trumpets.Quince asthe Prologue as Prologue) If we offend, it is with our good will.
That you should think: we come not to offend
But with good will. To show our simple skill,
That is the true beginning of our end.
Consider then we come but in despite.
We do not come as minding to content you,
Our true intent is. All for your delight
We are not here. That you should here repent you
The actors are at hand, and by their show
You shall know all that you are like to know.
