CARDINAL WOLSEY Tanta est erga te mentis integritas, Regina serenissima— QUEEN KATHERINE O, good my lord, no Latin. I am not such a truant since my coming
As not to know the language I have lived in.
A strange tongue makes my cause more strange
suspicious—
Pray, speak in English. Here are some will thank you,
If you speak truth, for their poor mistress’ sake.
Believe me, she has had much wrong. Lord Cardinal,
The willing’st sin I ever yet committed
May be absolved in English.
