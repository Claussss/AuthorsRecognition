Nay, ’tis in a manner done already,
For many carriages he hath dispatched
To the sea-side, and put his cause and quarrel
To the disposing of the Cardinal,
With whom yourself, myself, and other lords,
If you think meet, this afternoon will post
To consummate this business happily. Let it be so.—And you, my noble prince,
With other princes that may best be spared,
Shall wait upon your father’s funeral.
