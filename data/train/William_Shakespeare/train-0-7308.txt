Exit Diomedes driving inTroilus Enter Hector  What art thou, Greek? Art thou for Hector’s match?
Art thou of blood and honour? THERSITES No, no, I am a rascal, a scurvy railing knave, a very filthy rogue. HECTOR I do believe thee: live. THERSITES God-a-mercy, that thou wilt believe me— Exit Hector but a plague break thy neck for frighting me. What’s become of the wenching rogues? I think they have swallowed one another. I would laugh at that miracle—yet in a sort lechery eats itself. I’ll seek them.
