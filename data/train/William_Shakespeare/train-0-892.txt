KING HENRY (to Cardinal Beaufort) How fares my lord? Speak, Beaufort, to thy sovereign. CARDINAL BEAUFORT If thou beest death, I’ll give thee England’s treasure
Enough to purchase such another island,
So thou wilt let me live and feel no pain. Ah, what a sign it is of evil life
Where death’s approach is seen so terrible.
