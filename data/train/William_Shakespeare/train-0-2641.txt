What is the other fault, my sovereign lord? KING EDWARD Read o’er the line again. LODOWICK (reading) ‘More fair and chaste’— KING EDWARD (staying him) I did not bid thee talk of chastity,
To ransack so the treasure of her mind,
For I had rather have her chased than chaste!
Out with the moon line! I will none of it.
And let me have her likened to the sun-
Say she hath thrice more splendour than the sun,
That her perfections emulates the sun,
That she breeds sweets as plenteous as the sun,
That she doth thaw cold winter like the sun,
That she doth cheer fresh summer like the sun,
That she doth dazzle gazers like the sun,
And in this application to the sun
Bid her be free and general as the sun,
Who smiles upon the basest weed that grows
As lovingly as on the fragrant rose.
Let’s see what follows that same moonlight line.
