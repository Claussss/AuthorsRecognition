ARIEL (aside to Prospero) Was’t well done? PROSPERO (aside to Ariel) Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free. This is as strange a maze as e’er men trod,
And there is in this business more than nature
Was ever conduct of. Some oracle
Must rectify our knowledge. Sir, my liege, Do not infest your mind with beating on
The strangeness of this business. At picked leisure,
Which shall be shortly, single I’ll resolve you,
Which to you shall seem probable, of every
These happened accidents; till when be cheerful,
And think of each thing well. (Aside to Ariel) Come
hither, spirit.
Set Caliban and his companions free.
Untie the spell.
