By innocence I swear, and by my youth,
I have one heart, one bosom, and one truth,
And that no woman has, nor never none
Shall mistress be of it save I alone.
And so adieu, good madam. Never more
Will I my masterâ€™s tears to you deplore. Yet come again, for thou perhaps mayst move
That heart which now abhors, to like his love.
