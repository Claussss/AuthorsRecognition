Double, double, toil and trouble,
Fire burn, and cauldron bubble. SECOND WITCH Cool it with a baboon’s blood,
Then the charm is firm and good. Enter Hecate and the other three Witches O, well done! I commend your pains,
And everyone shall share i’th’ gains.
And now about the cauldron sing
Like elves and fairies in a ring,
Enchanting all that you put in.
Music and a song
