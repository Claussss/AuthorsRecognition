ALL SERVANTS Here, here sir, here sir. Here sir, here sir, here sir, here sir!
You logger-headed and unpolished grooms,
What! No attendance! No regard! No duty!
Where is the foolish knave I sent before? Here, sir, as foolish as I was before. You peasant swain, you whoreson, malthorse drudge,
Did I not bid thee meet me in the park
And bring along these rascal knaves with thee?
