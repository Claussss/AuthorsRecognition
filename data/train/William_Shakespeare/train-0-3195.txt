Enter Boyet Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face. O, I am stabbed with laughter! Where’s her grace? Thy news, Boyet? BOYET Prepare, madam, prepare. Arm, wenches, arm. Encounters mounted are
Against your peace. Love doth approach disguised,
Armed in arguments. You’ll be surprised.
Muster your wits, stand in your own defence,
Or hide your heads like cowards and fly hence.
