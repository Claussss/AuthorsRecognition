My lord, I would that Thursday were tomorrow. Well, get you gone. O’ Thursday be it, then.
(To his Wife) Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed.
Prepare her, wife, against this wedding day.—
Farewell, my lord.—Light to my chamber, ho!—
Afore me, it is so very late that we
May call it early by and by. Good night.
