ALL THE PLEBEIANS Most true. The will. Let’s stay and hear the will. Here is the will, and under Caesar’s seal.
To every Roman citizen he gives—
To every several man—seventy-five drachmas. Most noble Caesar! We’ll revenge his death. THIRD PLEBEIAN O royal Caesar! ANTONY Hear me with patience. ALL THE PLEBEIANS Peace, ho!
