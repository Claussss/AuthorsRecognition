Hie to high fortune! Honest Nurse, farewell. Exeunt severally 
2.5
Enter Friar Laurence and Romeo 
FRIAR LAURENCE So smile the heavens upon this holy act
That after-hours with sorrow chide us not! Amen, amen. But come what sorrow can,
It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
That one short minute gives me in her sight.
Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
Then love-devouring death do what he dareâ€”
It is enough I may but call her mine.
