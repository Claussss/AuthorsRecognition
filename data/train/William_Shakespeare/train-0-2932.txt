SECOND MERCHANT Well, officer, arrest him at my suit. OFFICER (to Angelo) I do, and charge you in the Duke’s name to obey me. ANGELO (to Antipholus) This touches me in reputation.
Either consent to pay this sum for me,
Or I attach you by this officer. ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Consent to pay thee that I never had?
Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou dar’st.
