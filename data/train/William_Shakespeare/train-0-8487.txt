EDGAR How long have you been a sectary astronomical? EDMUND Come, come, when saw you my father last? EDGAR Why, the night gone by. EDMUND Spake you with him? EDGAR Two hours together. EDMUND Parted you in good terms? Found you no displeasure in him by word or countenance? EDGAR None at all. EDMUND Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him, and at my entreaty forbear his presence till some little time hath qualified the heat of his displeasure, which at this instant so rageth in him that with the mischief of your person it would scarce allay.
