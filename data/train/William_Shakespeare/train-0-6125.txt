DARDANIUS O Clitus! What ill request did Brutus make to thee? To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates. Now is that noble vessel full of grief,
That it runs over even at his eyes. Come hither, good Volumnius. List a word. What says my lord? BRUTUS Why this, Volumnius. The ghost of Caesar hath appeared to me
Two several times by nightâ€”at Sardis once,
And this last night, here in Philippi fields.
I know my hour is come.
