MORE Close them not then with tears, for that ostent
Gives a wet signal of your discontent.
If you will share my fortunes, comfort then:
An hundred smiles for one sigh. What, we are men!
Resign wet passion to these weaker eyes,
Which proves their sex, but grants them ne‘er more
wise.
Let’s now survey our state. Here sits my wife
And dear-esteemed issue. Yonder stand
My loving servants. Now the difference
Twixt those and these. Now you shall hear me speak
Like More in melancholy. I conceive that nature
Hath sundry metals, out of which she frames
Us mortals, each in valuation
Outprizing other. Of the finest stuff
The finest features come. The rest of earth
Receive base fortune even before their birth.
Hence slaves have their creation. And I think
Nature provides content for the base mind—
Under the whip, the burden, and the toil
Their low-wrought bodies drudge in patience—
As for the prince, in all his sweet-gorged maw,
And his rank flesh that sinfully renews
The noon’s excess in the night’s dangerous surfeits.
What means or misery from our birth doth flow
Nature entitles to us; that we owe.
But we, being subject to the rack of hate,
Falling from happy life to bondage state,
Having seen better days, now know the lack
Of glory, that once reared each high-fed back.
But you that in your age did ne’er view better,
Challenge not fortune for your thriftless debtor.
