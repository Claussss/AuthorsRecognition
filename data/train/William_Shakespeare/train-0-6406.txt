The cock crows Speak of it, stay and speak.—Stop it, Marcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan? Do, if it will not stand. MARCELLUS ’Tis gone. We do it wrong, being so majestical,

For it is as the air invulnerable,
And our vain blows malicious mockery. It was about to speak when the cock crew.
