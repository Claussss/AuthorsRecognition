And given to Lartius and to Martius battle.
I saw our party to their trenches driven,
And then I came away. COMINIUS Though thou speak‘st truth, Methinks thou speak’st not well. How long is’t since? MESSENGER Above an hour, my lord. ’Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums.
How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,
And bring thy news so late?
