Be it his pleasure. FIRST LORD DUMAINE But I am sure the younger of our nation,
That surfeit on their ease, will day by day
Come here for physic. Welcome shall they be, And all the honours that can fly from us
Shall on them settle. You know your places well;
When better fall, for your avails they fell.
Tomorrow to the field.
