There goes the Talbot, with his colours spread,
And all the troops of English after him. Here sound a French march Now in the rearward comes the Duke and his;
Fortune in favour makes him lag behind.
Summon a parley. We will talk with him. Trumpets sound a
parley CHARLES calling A parley with the Duke of Burgundy.
