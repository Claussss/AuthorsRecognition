TIMON If I name thee. Iâ€™d beat thee, but I should infect my hands. I would my tongue could rot them off. Away, thou issue of a mangy dog!
Choler does kill me that thou art alive.
I swoon to see thee. APEMANTUS Would thou wouldst burst! TIMON Away, thou tedious rogue! He throws a stone at Apemantus I am sorry I shall lose a stone by thee.
