Which heartless peasants did so well resemble
That one would swear he saw them quake and
tremble. In Ajax and Ulysses, O what art
Of physiognomy might one behold!
The face of either ciphered either’s heart;
Their face their manners most expressly told.
In Ajax’ eyes blunt rage and rigour rolled, But the mild glance that sly Ulysses lent
Show I deep regard and smiling government.
