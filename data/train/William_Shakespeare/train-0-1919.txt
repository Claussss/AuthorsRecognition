Peace, peace! For shame, if not for charity. QUEEN MARGARET Urge neither charity nor shame to me.
Uncharitably with me have you dealt,
And shamefully my hopes by you are butchered.
My charity is outrage; life, my shame;
And in that shame still live my sorrowâ€™s rage. BUCKINGHAM Have done, have done. QUEEN MARGARET
