Enter Petruccio, Katherine, Bianca, Hortensio as
Licio, Baptista, Grumio, and others, attendants Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for your pains.
I know you think to dine with me today,
And have prepared great store of wedding cheer.
But so it is my haste doth call me hence,
And therefore here I mean to take my leave.
