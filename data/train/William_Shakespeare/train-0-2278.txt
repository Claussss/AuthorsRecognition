The colt that’s backed and burdened being young,
Loseth his pride, and never waxeth strong. ‘You hurt my hand with wringing. Let us part,
And leave this idle theme, this bootless chat.
Remove your siege from my unyielding heart;
To love’s alarms it will not ope the gate. Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your
flatt‘ry;
For where a heart is hard they make no batt’ry.’
