JOHN OF GAUNT To be a make-peace shall become my age.
Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk’s gage. KING RICHARD And, Norfolk, throw down his. JOHN OF GAUNT When, Harry, when? Obedience bids I should not bid again. KING RICHARD Norfolk, throw down! We bid; there is no boot. MOWBRAY (kneeling) Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot.
My life thou shalt command, but not my shame.
The one my duty owes, but my fair name,
Despite of death that lives upon my grave,
To dark dishonour’s use thou shalt not have.
I am disgraced, impeached, and baffled here,
Pierced to the soul with slander’s venomed spear,
The which no balm can cure but his heart blood
Which breathed this poison.
