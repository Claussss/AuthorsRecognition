FIRST LORD Stand you? You have land enough of your own, but he added to your having, gave you some ground. SECOND LORD (aside) As many inches as you have oceans. Puppies! CLOTEN I would they had not come between us. SECOND LORD (aside) So would I, till you had measured how long a fool you were upon the ground.
