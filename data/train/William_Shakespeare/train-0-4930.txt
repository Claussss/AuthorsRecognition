Enter Sir John Falstaff SIR JOHN Have I caught thee, my heavenly jewel? Why, now let me die, for I have lived long enough. This is the period of my ambition. O, this blessed hour! MISTRESS FORD O sweet Sir John! SIR JOHN Mistress Ford, I cannot cog; I cannot prate, Mistress Ford. Now shall I sin in my wish: I would thy husband were dead. Iâ€™ll speak it before the best lord. I would make thee my lady.
