WARWICK to York Poor Clifford, how I scorn his worthless threats. YORK to King Henry Will you we show our title to the crown?
If not, our swords shall plead it in the field. What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?
Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York;
Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March.
I am the son of Henry the Fifth,
Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop
And seized upon their towns and provinces.
