Sweet love, I see, changing his property,
Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate.
Again uncurse their souls. Their peace is made
With heads, and not with hands. Those whom you
curse
Have felt the worst of deathâ€™s destroying wound,
And lie full low, graved in the hollow ground. Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?
