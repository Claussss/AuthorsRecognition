KING EDWARD Then be it as you will, for ’tis my right,
And Henry but usurps the diadem. Ay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself,
And now will I be Edward’s champion. Sound trumpet, Edward shall be here proclaimed.
To Montgomery
Come, fellow soldier, make thou proclamation.
Flourish King of England and France, and Lord of Ireland—
And whosoe’er gainsays King Edward’s right,
By this I challenge him to single fight.
