SUFFOLK And free us from his slavery. NORFOLK. We had need pray, And heartily, for our deliverance,
Or this imperious man will work us all
From princes into pages. All men’s honours
Lie like one lump before him, to be fashioned
Into what pitch he please. For me, my lords, I love him not, nor fear him—there’s my creed.
As I am made without him, so I’ll stand,
If the King please. His curses and his blessings
Touch me alike; they’re breath I not believe in.
I knew him, and I know him; so I leave him
To him that made him proud—the Pope.
