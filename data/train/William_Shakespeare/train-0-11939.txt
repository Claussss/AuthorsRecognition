ALL THREE QUEENS (to Emilia) O, help now, Our cause cries for your knee. EMILIA (kneels to Theseus) If you grant not My sister her petition in that force
With that celerity and nature which
She makes it in, from henceforth Iâ€™ll not dare
To ask you anything, nor be so hardy
Ever to take a husband. Pray stand up.
