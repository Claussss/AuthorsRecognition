EARL or SALISBURY Farewell, Villiers! Thus once I mean to try a Frenchmanâ€™s faith. Sc. 10
Enter King Edward and the Earl of Derby with soldiers 
KING EDWARD Since they refuse our proffered league, my lord,
And will not ope their gates and let us in,
We will entrench ourselves on every side,
That neither victuals nor supply of men
May come to succour this accursed town.
Famine shall combat where our swords are stopped.
