RICHARD GLOUCESTER Say that I slew them not. Then say they were not slain. But dead they are—and, devilish slave, by thee. RICHARD GLOUCESTER I did not kill your husband. Why, then he is alive. RICHARD GLOUCESTER Nay, he is dead, and slain by Edward’s hand. In thy foul throat thou liest. Queen Margaret saw
Thy murd’rous falchion smoking in his blood,
The which thou once didst bend against her breast,
But that thy brothers beat aside the point.
