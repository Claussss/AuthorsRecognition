Exit Salisbury QUEEN MARGARET kneeling O Henry, let me plead for gentle Suffolk. Ungentle Queen, to call him gentle Suffolk.
No more, I say! If thou dost plead for him
Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath.
Had I but said, I would have kept my word;
But when I swear, it is irrevocable.
(To Suffolk) If after three daysâ€™ space thou here beest
found
On any ground that I am ruler of,
The world shall not be ransom for thy life.
Come, Warwick; come, good Warwick, go with me.
I have great matters to impart to thee.
