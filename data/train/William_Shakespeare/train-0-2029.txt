LORD HASTINGS How? ‘Wear the garland’? Dost thou mean the crown? CATESBY Ay, my good lord. LORD HASTINGS I’ll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders
Before I’ll see the crown so foul misplaced.
But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it? Ay, on my life, and hopes to find you forward
Upon his party for the gain thereof—
And thereupon he sends you this good news:
That this same very day your enemies,
The kindred of the Queen, must die at Pomfret.
