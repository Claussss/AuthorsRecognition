That Somerset be sent as regent thither.
’Tis meet that lucky ruler be employed—
Witness the fortune he hath had in France. If York, with all his far-fet policy,
Had been the regent there instead of me,
He never would have stayed in France so long. No, not to lose it all as thou hast done.
I rather would have lost my life betimes
Than bring a burden of dishonour home
By staying there so long till all were lost.
Show me one scar charactered on thy skin.
Men’s flesh preserved so whole do seldom win.
