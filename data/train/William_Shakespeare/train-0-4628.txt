HOSTESS O Jesu, he doth it as like one of these harlotry players as ever I see! Peace, good pint-pot; peace, good tickle-brain.—
Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy
time, but also how thou art accompanied. For though
the camomile, the more it is trodden on, the faster it
grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted, the sooner it
wears. That thou art my son I have partly thy mother’s
word, partly my own opinion, but chiefly a villainous
trick of thine eye, and a foolish hanging of thy nether
lip, that doth warrant me. If then thou be son to me,
here lies the point. Why, being son to me, art thou so
pointed at? Shall the blessed sun of heaven prove a
micher, and eat btackberries?—A question not to be
asked. Shall the son of England prove a thief, and take
purses?—A question to be asked. There is a thing,
Harry, which thou hast often heard of, and it is known
to many in our land by the name of pitch. This pitch,
as ancient writers do report, doth defile. So doth the
company thou keepest. For Harry, now I do not speak
to thee in drink, but in tears; not in pleasure, but in
passion; not in words only, but in woes also. And yet
there is a virtuous man whom I have often noted in
thy company, but I know not his name.
