ROSENCRANTZ Take you me for a sponge, my lord? HAMLET Ay, sir, that soaks up the Kingâ€™s countenance, his rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the King best service in the end. He keeps them, like an ape an apple in the corner of his jaw, first mouthed to be last swallowed. When he needs what you have gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you shall be dry again.
