EMILIA Here’s a change indeed. ‘Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.
How have I been behaved, that he might stick
The small’st opinion on my least misuse? Enter Iago and Emilia, What is your pleasure, madam? How is’t with you? I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes
Do it with gentle means and easy tasks.
He might ha’ chid me so, for, in good faith,
I am a child to chiding.
