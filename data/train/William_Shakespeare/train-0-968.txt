Enter the Duke of Buckingham and Lord Clifford  BUCKINGHAM (to King Henry) Health and glad tidings to your majesty. Why, Buckingham, is the traitor Cade surprised?
Or is he but retired to make him strong? Enter, below, multitudes with halters about their necks He is fled, my lord, and all his powers do yield,
And humbly thus with halters on their necks
Expect your highnessâ€™ doom of life or death.
