This is no answer. But that you shall not say I yield being silent,
I would not speak. I pray you, spare me. Faith,
I shall unfold equal discourtesy
To your best kindness. One of your great knowing
Should learn, being taught, forbearance. To leave you in your madness, â€™twere my sin.
I will not. Fools cure not mad folks.
