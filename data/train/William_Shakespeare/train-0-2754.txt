KING EDWARD Well then, we’ll have a pursuivant dispatched
To summon Copland hither out of hand,
And with him he shall bring his prisoner-king. The Queen, my lord, herself by this at sea,
And purposeth, as soon as wind will serve,
To land at Calais, and to visit you. KING EDWARD She shall be welcome, and to wait her coming
I’ll pitch my tent near to the sandy shore.
