Enter a Messenger My honourable lords, health to you all.
Sad tidings bring I to you out of France,
Of loss, of slaughter, and discomfiture.
Guyenne, Compiegne, Rouen, Rheims, Orl
Paris, Gisors, Poitiers are all quite lost. What sayst thou, man, before dead Henryâ€™s corpse?
Speak softly, or the loss of those great towns
Will make him burst his lead and rise from death.
