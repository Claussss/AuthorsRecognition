KING EDWARD Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,
Tell me some reason why the Lady Gray
Should not become my wife and Englandâ€™s queen.
And you too, Somerset and Montague,
Speak freely what you think. GEORGE OF CLARENCE Then this is my opinion: that King Louis
Becomes your enemy for mocking him
About the marriage of the Lady Bona.
