Had she such power She had just cause. She had, and would incense me To murder her I married. I should SO. Were I the ghost that walked I’d bid you mark
Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in’t
You chose her. Then I’d shriek that even your ears
Should rift to hear me, and the words that followed
Should be, ‘Remember mine’.
