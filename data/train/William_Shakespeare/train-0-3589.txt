Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling;
Being but heavy, I will bear the light. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance. Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes
With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move. You are a lover; borrow Cupidâ€™s wings,
And soar with them above a common bound.
