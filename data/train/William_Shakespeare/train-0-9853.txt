PAROLES I am a poor man, and at your majesty’s command. LAFEU (to the King) He’s a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator. DIANA (to Paroles) Do you know he promised me marriage? PAROLES Faith, I know more than I’ll speak. KING But wilt thou not speak all thou know’st? PAROLES Yes, so please your majesty. I did go between them, as I said; but more than that, he loved her, for indeed he was mad for her and talked of Satan and of limbo and of Furies and I know not what. Yet I was in that credit with them at that time that I knew of their going to bed and of other motions, as promising her marriage and things which would derive me ill will to speak of. Therefore I will not speak what I know.
