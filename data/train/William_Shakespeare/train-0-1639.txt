A goodly lady, trust me, of the hue
That I would choose were I to choose anew.
Clear up, fair queen, that cloudy countenance.
Though chance of war hath wrought this change of
cheer,
Thou comâ€™st not to be made a scorn in Rome.
Princely shall be thy usage every way.
Rest on my word, and let not discontent
Daunt all your hopes. Madam, he comforts you
Can make you greater than the Queen of Goths.
Lavinia, you are not displeased with this?
