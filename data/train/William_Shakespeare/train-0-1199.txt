WARWICK (to Queen Margaret) Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,
Where having nothing, nothing can he lose.
And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,
You have a father able to maintain you,
And better ’twere you troubled him than France. QUEEN MARGARET Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, peace!
Proud setter-up and puller-down of kings!
I will not hence till, with my talk and tears,
Both full of truth, I make King Louis behold
Thy sly conveyance and thy lord’s false love,
Post blowing a horn within
For both of you are birds of selfsame feather.
