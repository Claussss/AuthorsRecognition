Exit Iras
A noise within Wherefore’s this noise? Enter a Guardsman Here is a rural fellow That will not be denied your highness’ presence.
He brings you figs. Let him come in. Exit Guardsman What poor an instrument May do a noble deed! He brings me liberty.
My resolution’s placed, and I have nothing
Of woman in me. Now from head to foot
I am marble-constant. Now the fleeting moon
No planet is of mine.
