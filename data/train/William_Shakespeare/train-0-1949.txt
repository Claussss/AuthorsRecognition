SECOND MURDERER And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee,
For false forswearing, and for murder too.
Thou didst receive the sacrament to fight
In quarrel of the house of Lancaster. FIRST MURDERER And, like a traitor to the name of God,
Didst break that vow, and with thy treacherous blade
Unripped‘st the bowels of thy sov’reign’s son.
