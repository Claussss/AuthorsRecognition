GREMIO O sir, such a life with such a wife were strange. But if you have a stomach, to’t, a’ God’s name.
You shall have me assisting you in all.
But will you woo this wildcat? PETRUCCIO Will I live! Will he woo her? Ay, or I’ll hang her. Why came I hither but to that intent?
Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?
Have I not in my time heard lions roar?
Have I not heard the sea, puffed up with winds,
Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?
Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,
And heaven’s artillery thunder in the skies?
Have I not in a pitched battle heard
Loud ’larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets’ clang?
And do you tell me of a woman’s tongue,
That gives not half so great a blow to hear
As will a chestnut in a farmer’s fire ?
Tush, tush—fear boys with bugs.
