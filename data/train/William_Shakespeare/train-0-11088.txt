There cannot be a pinch in death More sharp than this is. O disloyal thing, That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap’st
A year’s age on me. I beseech you, sir, Harm not yourself with your vexation.
I am senseless of your wrath. A touch more rare
Subdues all pangs, all fears. Past grace, obedience- Past hope and in despair: that way past grace.
