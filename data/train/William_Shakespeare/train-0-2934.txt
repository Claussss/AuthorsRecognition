Sir, sir, I shall have law in Ephesus,
To your notorious shame, I doubt it not. Enter Dromio of Syracuse, from the bay DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Master, thereâ€™s a barque of Epidamnum
That stays but till her owner comes aboard,
And then she bears away. Our freightage, sir,
I have conveyed aboard, and I have bought
The oil, the balsamum, and aqua-vitae.
The ship is in her trim; the merry wind
Blows fair from land. They stay for naught at all
But for their owner, master, and yourself.
