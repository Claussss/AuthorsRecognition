You do extend These thoughts of horror further than you shall
Find cause in Caesar. Enter Dolabella Proculeius, What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows,
And he hath sent for thee. For the Queen,
I’ll take her to my guard. So, Dolabella, It shall content me best. Be gentle to her.
(To Cleopatra) To Caesar I will speak what you shall
please,
If you’ll employ me to him.
