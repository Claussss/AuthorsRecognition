My brave spirit! Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil
Would not infect his reason? But felt a fever of the mad, and played
Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners
Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,
Then all afire with me. The King’s son Ferdinand,
With hair upstaring—then like reeds, not hair—
Was the first man that leaped; cried ‘Hell is empty,
And all the devils are here’.
