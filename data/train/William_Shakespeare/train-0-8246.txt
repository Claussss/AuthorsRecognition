CASSIO Yet I beseech you, If you think fit, or that it may be done,
Give me advantage of some brief discourse
With Desdemon alone. EMILIA Pray you come in. I will bestow you where you shall have time
To speak your bosom freely. CASSIO I am much bound to you. 3.2
Enter Othello, Iago, and Gentlemen These letters give, Iago, to the pilot,
And by him do my duties to the senate.
That done, I will be walking on the works.
Repair there to me.
