PETRUCCIO Villain, I say, knock me here soundly. GRUMIO Knock you here, sir? Why, sir, what am I, sir, that I should knock you here, sir? Petruccio means ‘Knock on the door for me’, but Grumio interprets it to mean (as it would in Modern English) ‘hit me’. If we do not recognize the ethical dative in Petruccio’s sentence in the first place, we will miss the point of the joke entirely. But the fact that Grumio is confused suggests that the usage was probably already dying out in Shakespeare’s time.
