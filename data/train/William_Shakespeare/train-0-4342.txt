Ay, marry, I’ll be gone about it straight. And so will I. LORENZO Meet me and Graziano At Graziano’s lodging some hour hence. SALERIO ’Tis good we do so. Exit with Solanio Was not that letter from fair Jessica? I must needs tell thee all. She hath directed
How I shall take her from her father’s house,
What gold and jewels she is furnished with,
What page’s suit she hath in readiness.
If e’er the Jew her father come to heaven
It will be for his gentle daughter’s sake;
And never dare misfortune cross her foot
Unless she do it under this excuse:
That she is issue to a faithless Jew.
Come, go with me. Peruse this as thou goest.
