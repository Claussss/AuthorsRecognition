My Lord, I like it well. See, they are coming. Waits play hautbois
The waits plays. Enters Lord Mayor, so many Aldermen
as may, the Lady Mayoress, in scarlet, with other
ladies and Sir Thomas More’s daughters, [one of them
Roper’s wife]; Servants carrying lighted torches by them Once again, welcome, welcome, my good Lord Mayor,
And brethren all—for once I was your brother,
And so am still in heart. It is not state
That can our love from London separate.
