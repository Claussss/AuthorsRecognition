MASTER What mean you, sir? To beg of you, kind friends, this coat of worth,
For it was sometime target to a king.
I know it by this mark. He loved me dearly,
And for his sake I wish the having of it,
And that you’d guide me to your sov’reign’s court,
Where with’t I may appear a gentleman.
And if that ever my low fortune’s better,
I’ll pay your bounties, till then rest your debtor.
