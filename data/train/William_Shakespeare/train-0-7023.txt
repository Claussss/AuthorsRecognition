PANDARUS I do not care whether you do or no. She’s a fool to stay behind her father. Let her to the Greeks—and so I’ll tell her the next time I see her. For my part, I’ll meddle nor make no more i’th’ matter. TROILUS Pandarus— PANDARUS Not I. TROILUS Sweet Pandarus— PANDARUS Pray you, speak no more to me. I will leave all as I found it. And there an end.
