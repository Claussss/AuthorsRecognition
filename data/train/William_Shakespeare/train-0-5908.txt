ANTONY Caesar, my lord. Forget not in your speed, Antonio,
To touch Calpurnia, for our elders say
The barren, touched in this holy chase,
Shake off their sterile curse. I shall remember: When Caesar says ‘Do this’, it is performed. Set on, and leave no ceremony out. SOOTHSAYER Caesar! CAESAR Ha! Who calls?
