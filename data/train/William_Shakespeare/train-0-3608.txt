Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
Which mannerly devotion shows in this.
For saints have hands that pilgrims’ hands do touch,
And palm to palm is holy palmers’ kiss. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers, too? Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer. O then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do:
They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
