Farewell, Master Morris. Thy head is for thy shoulders now more fit:
Thou hast less hair upon it, but more wit. exit MORRIS Did not I tell thee always of these locks? FALKNER An the locks were on again, all the goldsmiths in Cheapside should not pick them open. ’Sheart, if my hair stand not on end when I look for my face in a glass, I am a potecat.—Here’s a lousy jest.—But if I notch not that rogue Tom Barber that makes me look thus like a Brownist, hang me. I’ll be worse to the nittical knave than ten tooth-drawings. Here’s a head with a pox!
