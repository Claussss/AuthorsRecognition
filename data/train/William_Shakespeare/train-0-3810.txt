He kisses Juliet, then pours poison into the cup  Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide,
Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
The dashing rocks thy seasick weary barque!
Hereâ€™s to my love. He drinks the poison  O true apothecary,
Thy drugs are quick! Thus with a kiss I die. He kisses Juliet, falls, and dies.
