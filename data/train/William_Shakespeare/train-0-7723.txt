To doubt the worst is still the wise man’s shield
That arms him safely, but the world knows this:
The Emperor is a man of royal faith.
His love unto our sovereign brings him down
From his imperial seat, to march in pay
Under our English flag, and wear the cross
Like some high order on his manly breast.
Thus serving, he’s not master of himself,
But, like a colonel, commanding other,
Is by the general overawed himself.
