KING RICHARD Be not so hasty to confound my meaning.
I mean, that with my soul I love thy daughter,
And do intend to make her queen of England. QUEEN ELIZABETH Well then, who dost thou mean shall be her king? KING RICHARD Even he that makes her queen. Who else should be? QUEEN ELIZABETH What, thou? KING RICHARD Even so. How think you of it?
