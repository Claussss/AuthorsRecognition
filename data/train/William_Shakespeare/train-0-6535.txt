A PLAYER I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us, sir. HAMLET O, reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them; for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time some necessary question of the play be then to be considered. Thatâ€™s villainous, and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go make you ready. Exeunt Players
