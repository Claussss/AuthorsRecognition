PROTEUS But she loves you? Ay, and we are betrothed. Nay more, our marriage
hour,
With all the cunning manner of our flight,
Determined of: how I must climb her window,
The ladder made of cords, and all the means
Plotted and â€˜greed on for my happiness.
Good Proteus, go with me to my chamber
In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel.
