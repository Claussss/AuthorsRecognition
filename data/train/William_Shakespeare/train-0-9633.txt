Ay, my good lord. G
In what he did profess, well found. I knew him. The rather will I spare my praises towards him;
Knowing him is enough. On’s bed of death
Many receipts he gave me, chiefly one
Which, as the dearest issue of his practice,
And of his old experience th’only darling,
He bade me store up as a triple eye
Safer than mine own two, more dear. I have so,
And hearing your high majesty is touched
With that malignant cause wherein the honour no
Of my dear father’s gift stands chief in power,
I come to tender it and my appliance
With all bound humbleness.
