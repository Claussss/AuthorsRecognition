Sir, sir, the first’s for me. Let her go by. Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules,
And let it be more than Alcides’ twelve. Sir, understand you this of me in sooth,
The youngest daughter whom you hearken for
Her father keeps from all access of suitors,
And will not promise her to any man
Until the elder sister first be wed.
The younger then is free, and not before.
