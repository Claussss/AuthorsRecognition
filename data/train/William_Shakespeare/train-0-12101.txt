FIRST FRIEND (to the Jailer’s Daughter) Yes, he’s a fine man. JAILER’S DAUGHTER O, is he so? You have a sister. FIRST FRIEND Yes. JAILER’S DAUGHTER But she shall never have him, tell her so,
For a trick that I know. You’d best look to her,
For if she see him once, she’s gone—she’s done
And undone in an hour. All the young maids
Of our town are in love with him, but I laugh at
’em
And let ’em all alone. Is’t not a wise course?
