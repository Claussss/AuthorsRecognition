Exit the Prince of Wales (Aside) Thy mother is but black, and thou, like her,
Dost put it in my mind how foul she is.
(To Lodowick) Go, fetch the Countess hither in thy handâ€” Exit Lodowick And let her chase away these winter clouds,
For she gives beauty both to heaven and earth.
The sin is more to hack and hew poor men
Than to embrace in an unlawful bed
The register of all rarieties
Since leathern Adam till this youngest hour.
