JOHN OF LANCASTER We breathe too long. Come, cousin Westmorland,
Our duty this way lies. For Godâ€™s sake, come. Exeunt Lancaster and Westmorland PRINCE HARRY By God, thou hast deceived me, Lancaster;
I did not think thee lord of such a spirit.
Before I loved thee as a brother, John,
But now I do respect thee as my soul.
