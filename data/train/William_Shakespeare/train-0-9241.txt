Hear the ambassadors. Fie, wrangling queen, Whom everything becomes—to chide, to laugh,
To weep; how every passion fully strives
To make itself, in thee, fair and admired!
No messenger but thine; and all alone
Tonight we’ll wander through the streets and note
The qualities of people. Come, my queen.
Last night you did desire it. (To the Messenger) Speak
not to us.
