Yes, I love her—And if the lives of all my name lay on it,
I must do so. I love her with my soul—
If that will lose ye, farewell, Palamon!
I say again,
I love her, and in loving her maintain
I am as worthy and as free a lover,
And have as just a title to her beauty,
As any Palamon, or any living
That is a man’s son.
