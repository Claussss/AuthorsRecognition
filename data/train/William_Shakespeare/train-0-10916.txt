Enter the Earl of Kent disguised No, I will be the pattern of all patience.
I will say nothing. KENT Who’s there? FOOL Marry, here’s grace and a codpiece—that’s a wise man and a fool. KENT (to Lear) Alas, sir, are you here? Things that love night
Love not such nights as these. The wrathful skies
Gallow the very wanderers of the dark
And make them keep their caves. Since I was man
Such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder,
Such groans of roaring wind and rain I never
Remember to have heard. Man’s nature cannot carry
Th’affliction nor the fear.
