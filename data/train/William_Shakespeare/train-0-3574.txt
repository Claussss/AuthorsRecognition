Enter Benvolio and Romeo  In good time. BENVOLIO (to Romeo) Tut, man, one fire burns out another’s burning,
One pain is lessened by another’s anguish.
Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning.
One desperate grief cures with another’s languish.
Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
And the rank poison of the old will die.
