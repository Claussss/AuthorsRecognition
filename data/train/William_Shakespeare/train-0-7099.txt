Brother, she is not worth what she doth cost
The holding. TROILUS What’s aught but as ’tis valued? But value dwells not in particular will.
It holds his estimate and dignity
As well wherein ‘tis precious of itself
As in the prizer. ’Tis mad idolatry
To make the service greater than the god;
And the will dotes that is inclinable
To what infectiously itself affects
Without some image of th’affected merit.
