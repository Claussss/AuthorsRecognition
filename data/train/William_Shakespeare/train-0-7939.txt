Better it were a brother died at once
Than that a sister, by redeeming him,
Should die for ever. Were not you then as cruel as the sentence
That you have slandered so? Ignominy in ransom and free pardon
Are of two houses; lawful mercy
Is nothing kin to foul redemption. You seemed of late to make the law a tyrant,
And rather proved the sliding of your brother
A merriment than a vice.
