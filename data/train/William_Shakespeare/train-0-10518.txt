There is a sickness Which puts some of us in distemper, but
I cannot name th’ disease, and it is caught
Of you that yet are well. How caught of me? Make me not sighted like the basilisk.
I have looked on thousands who have sped the better
By my regard, but killed none so. Camillo,
As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto
Clerk-like experienced, which no less adorns
Our gentry than our parents’ noble names,
In whose success we are gentle: I beseech you,
If you know aught which does behove my knowledge
Thereof to be informed, imprison’t not
In ignorant concealment.
