The tenor of them doth but signify
My health and happy being at your court. Nay then, no matter. Stay with me awhile.
I am to break with thee of some affairs
That touch me near, wherein thou must be secret.
â€˜Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought
To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter. I know it well, my lord; and sure the match
Were rich and honourable. Besides, the gentleman
Is full of virtue, bounty, worth, and qualities
Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter.
Cannot your grace win her to fancy him?
