Who is my principal? LYSIMACHUS Why, your herb-woman; She that sets seeds of shame, roots of iniquity. Marina weeps O, you’ve heard something of my pow‘r, and so
Stand off aloof for a more serious wooing.
But I protest to thee,
Pretty one, my authority can wink
At blemishes, or can on faults look friendly;
Or my displeasure punish at my pleasure,
From which displeasure, not thy beauty shall
Privilege thee, nor my affection, which
Hath drawn me here, abate with further ling’ring.
Come bring me to some private place. Come, come.
