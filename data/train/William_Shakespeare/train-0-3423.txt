My liege, one word. KING RICHARD He does me double wrong That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue.
Discharge my followers. Let them hence away
From Richard’s night to Bolingbroke’s fair day.
Exeunt 3.3
Enter Bolingbroke Duke of Lancaster and Hereford, the Duke of York, the Earl of Northumberland, and soldiers, with drum and colours
