ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Now, as I am a Christian, answer me
In what safe place you have bestowed my money,
Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours
That stands on tricks when I am undisposed.
Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me? DROMIO OF EPHESUS I have some marks of yours upon my pate,
Some of my mistressâ€™ marks upon my shoulders,
But not a thousand marks between you both.
If I should pay your worship those again,
Perchance you will not bear them patiently.
