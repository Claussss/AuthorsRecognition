To th’ King I’ll say’t, and make my vouch as strong
As shore of rock. Attend: this holy fox,
Or wolf, or both—for he is equal rav’nous
As he is subtle, and as prone to mischief
As able to perform’t, his mind and place
Infecting one another, yea, reciprocatly—
Only to show his pomp as well in France
As here at home, suggests the King our master
To this last costly treaty, th’interview
That swallowed so much treasure and, like a glass,
Did break i’th’ rinsing.
