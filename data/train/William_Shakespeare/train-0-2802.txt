Victorious Prince—that thou art so, behold
A Caesar’s fame in kings’ captivity—
If I could hold dim death but at a bay
Till I did see my liege, thy royal father,
My soul should yield this castle of my flesh,
This mangled tribute, with all willingness,
To darkness, consummation, dust and worms. PRINCE OF WALES
