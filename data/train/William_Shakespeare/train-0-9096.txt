SECOND MURDERER I am one, my liege, Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world
Hath so incensed that I am reckless what
I do to spite the world. FIRST MURDERER And I another, So weary with disasters, tugged with fortune,
That I would set my life on any chance
To mend it or be rid onâ€™t. Both of you
