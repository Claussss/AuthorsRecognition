Our flesh and blood, my lord, is grown so vile
That it doth hate what gets it. EDGAR Poor Tom’s a-cold. GLOUCESTER (to Lear) Go in with me. My duty cannot suffer
T’obey in all your daughters’ hard commands.
Though their injunction be to bar my doors
And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you,
Yet have I ventured to come seek you out
And bring you where both fire and food is ready.
