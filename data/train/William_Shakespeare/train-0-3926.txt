I go, I go—look how I go,
Swifter than arrow from the Tartar’s bow. Exit Flower of this purple dye,
Hit with Cupid’s archery,
Sink in apple of his eye. He drops the juice on Demetrius’ eyelids When his love he doth espy,
Let her shine as gloriously
As the Venus of the sky.
When thou wak’st, if she be by,
Beg of her for remedy.
