That all the faults which in thy reign are made
May likewise be sepulchred in thy shade. ‘Make me not object to the tell-tale day:
The light will show charactered in my brow
The story of sweet chastity’s decay,
The impious breach of holy wedlock vow.
Yea, the illiterate that know not how To cipher what is writ in learned books
Will quote my loathsome trespass in my looks.
