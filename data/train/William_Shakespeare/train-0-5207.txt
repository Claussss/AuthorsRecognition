PRINCE HARRY I shall drive you, then, to confess the wilful abuse, and then I know how to handle you. SIR JOHN No abuse, Hal; o’mine honour, no abuse. PRINCE HARRY Not? To dispraise me, and call me ‘pantler’ and ‘bread-chipper’ and I know not what? SIR JOHN No abuse, Hal. POINS No abuse? SIR JOHN No abuse, Ned, i’th’ world, honest Ned, none. I dispraised him before the wicked, that the wicked might not fall in love with him; (to Prince Harry) in which doing I have done the part of a careful friend and a true subject, and thy father is to give me thanks for it. No abuse, Hal; none, Ned, none; no, faith, boys, none.
