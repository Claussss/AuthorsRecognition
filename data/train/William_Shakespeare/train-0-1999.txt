Who hath committed them? The mighty dukes, Gloucester and Buckingham. For what offence? The sum of all I can, I have disclosed.
Why or for what the nobles were committed
Is all unknown to me, my gracious lord. QUEEN ELIZABETH Ay me! I see the ruin of our house.
The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind.
Insulting tyranny begins to jet
Upon the innocent and aweless throne.
Welcome destruction, blood, and massacre!
I see, as in a map, the end of all.
