RANDALL If I do not deserve a share for playing of your lordship well, let me be yeoman usher to your sumpter and be banished from wearing of a gold chain forever. Well, sir, I’ll hide our motion. Act my part
With a firm boldness, and thou winn’st my heart.
Enter the Sheriff, with Falkner (a ruffian) and Officers
How now, what’s the matter?
