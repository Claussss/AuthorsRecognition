LIEUTENANT Itâ€™s very strange. It will be found as true. I think, sir, that with most part of my coin
I have purchased as strange commodities
As ever you heard tell of in your life. LIEUTENANT Commodities, my lord? Might I without offence enquire of them? Crutches, Master Lieutenant, and bare cloaks,
For halting soldiers and poor needy scholars,
Have had my gettings in the Chancery.
To think but what acheat the crown shall have
By my attainder! I prithee, if thou beest a gentleman,
Get but a copy of my inventory.
That part of poet that was given me
Made me a very unthrift;
For this is the disease attends us all:
Poets were never thrifty, never shall.
