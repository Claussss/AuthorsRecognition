Enter Oswald the steward How now, where’s the King? My lord of Gloucester hath conveyed him hence.
Some five- or six-and-thirty of his knights,
Hot questants after him, met him at gate,
Who, with some other of the lord’s dependants,
Are gone with him towards Dover, where they boast
To have well-armed friends.
