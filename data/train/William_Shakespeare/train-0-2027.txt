LORD HASTINGS Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord.
 Bid him not fear the separated councils.
 His honour and myself are at the one,
 And at the other is my good friend Catesby,
 Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
 Whereof I shall not have intelligence.
 Tell him his fears are shallow, without instance.
 And for his dreams, I wonder he’s so simple,
 To trust the mock’ry of unquiet slumbers.
 To fly the boar before the boar pursues
 Were to incense the boar to follow us,
 And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.
 Go, bid thy master rise, and come to me,
 And we will both together to the Tower,
 Where he shall see the boar will use us kindly.
