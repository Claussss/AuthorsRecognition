And you of yours, my lord. I say no more,
Nor wish no less; and so I take my leave. Traitor, if Rome have law or we have power,
Thou and thy faction shall repent this rape. ‘Rape’ call you it, my lord, to seize my own—
My true betrothed love, and now my wife?
But let the laws of Rome determine all;
Meanwhile am I possessed of that is mine.
