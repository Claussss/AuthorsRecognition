IAGO I bleed, sir, but not killed. I am not sorry, neither. I’d have thee live,
For in my sense ’tis happiness to die. O thou Othello, that was once so good,
Fall’n in the practice of a cursed slave,
What shall be said to thee? OTHELLO Why, anything; An honourable murderer, if you will,
For naught I did in hate, but all in honour.
