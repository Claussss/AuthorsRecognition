Yes, worthy sir, The slave’s report is seconded, and more,
More fearful, is delivered. What more fearful? It is spoke freely out of many mouths—
How probable I do not know—that Martius,
Joined with Aufidius, leads a power ‘gainst Rome,
And vows revenge as spacious as between
The young’st and oldest thing.
