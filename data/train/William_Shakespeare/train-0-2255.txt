Thou art no man, though of a man’s complexion,
For men will kiss even by their own direction.’ This said, impatience chokes her pleading tongue,
And swelling passion doth provoke a pause.
Red cheeks and fiery eyes blaze forth her wrong.
Being judge in love, she cannot right her cause; And now she weeps, and now she fain would speak,
And now her sobs do her intendments break.
