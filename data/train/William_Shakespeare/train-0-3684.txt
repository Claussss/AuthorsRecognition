Enter Romeo Well, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man. But I’ll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery.
Marry, go before to field, he’ll be your follower.
Your worship in that sense may call him ‘man’. Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford
No better term than this: thou art a villain. Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
To such a greeting. Villain am I none.
Therefore, farewell. I see thou knowest me not.
