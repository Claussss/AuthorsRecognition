Thou that begett’st him that did thee beget,
Thou that wast born at sea, buried at Tarsus,
And found at sea again!—O Helicanus,
Down on thy knees, thank the holy gods as loud
As thunder threatens us, this is Marina!
(To Marina) What was thy mother’s name? Tell me
but that,
For truth can never be confirmed enough,
Though doubts did ever sleep.
