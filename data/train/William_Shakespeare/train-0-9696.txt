Let that go. My haste is very great. Farewell. Hie home. Pray sir, your pardon. Well, what would you say? I am not worthy of the wealth I owe,
Nor dare I say ’tis mine—and yet it is—
But like a timorous thief most fain would steal
What law does vouch mine own. What would you have? Something, and scarce so much: nothing indeed.
I would not tell you what I would, my lord. Faith,
yes:
Strangers and foes do sunder and not kiss.
