Enter at one door King John, the Bastard, Queen Eleanor and Lady Blanche, with soldiers; at another door King Philip, Louis the Dauphin, and the Duke of Austria with soldiers France, hast thou yet more blood to cast away?
Say, shall the current of our right run on, 335
Whose passage, vexed with thy impediment,
Shall leave his native channel and oâ€™erswell
With course disturbed even thy confining shores,
Unless thou let his silver water keep
A peaceful progress to the ocean? 340
