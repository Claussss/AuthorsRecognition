There’s some ill planet reigns. I must be patient till the heavens look
With an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,
I am not prone to weeping, as our sex no
Commonly are; the want of which vain dew
Perchance shall dry your pities. But I have
That honourable grief lodged here which burns
Worse than tears drown. Beseech you all, my lords,
With thoughts so qualified as your charities
Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so
The King’s will be performed.
