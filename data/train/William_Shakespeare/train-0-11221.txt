PISANIO (aside) What shall I need to draw my sword? The paper
Hath cut her throat already. No, â€™tis slander,
Whose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongue
Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath
Rides on the posting winds and doth belie
All corners of the world. Kings, queens, and states,
Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave
This viperous slander enters. (To Innogen) What cheer,
madam?
