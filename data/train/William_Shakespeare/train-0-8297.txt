DESDEMONA Well, my good lord. Give me your hand. This hand is moist, my lady. It hath felt no age, nor known no sorrow. This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart.
Hot, hot and moist—this hand of yours requires
A sequester from liberty; fasting, and prayer,
Much castigation, exercise devout,
For here’s a young and sweating devil here
That commonly rebels. ’Tis a good hand,
A frank one.
