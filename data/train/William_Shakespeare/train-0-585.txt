FIRST SERVINGMAN Who brought it? ’Tis burnt, and so is all the meat.
What dogs are these? Where is the rascal cook?
How durst you villains bring it from the dresser
And serve it thus to me that love it not?
There, (throwing food) take it to you, trenchers, cups,
and all,
You heedless jolt-heads and unmannered slaves.
What, do you grumble? I’ll be with you straight.
