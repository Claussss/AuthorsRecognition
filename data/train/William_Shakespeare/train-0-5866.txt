KING HARRY Well then, the peace, Which you before so urged, lies in his answer. KING CHARLES I have but with a cursitory eye
Oâ€™erglanced the articles. Pleaseth your grace
To appoint some of your council presently
To sit with us once more, with better heed
To re-survey them, we will suddenly
Pass our accept and peremptory answer.
