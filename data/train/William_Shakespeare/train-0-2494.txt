Poor helpless help, the treasure stol’n away,
To burn the guiltless casket where it lay! ‘Well, well, dear Collatine, thou shalt not know
The stained taste of violated troth.
I will not wrong thy true affection so
To flatter thee with an infringed oath.
This bastard graft shall never come to growth.
