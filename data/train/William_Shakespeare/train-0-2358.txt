‘Since thou art dead, lo, here I prophesy
Sorrow on love hereafter shall attend.
It shall be waited on with jealousy,
Find sweet beginning, but unsavoury end; Ne’er settled equally, but high or low,
That all love’s pleasure shall not match his woe. ‘It shall be fickle, false, and full of fraud,
Bud, and be blasted, in a breathing-while:
The bottom poison, and the top o’erstrawed
With sweets that shall the truest sight beguile.
