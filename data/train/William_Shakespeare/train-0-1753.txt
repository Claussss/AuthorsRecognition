YOUNG LUCIUS I say, my lord, that if I were a man
Their mother’s bedchamber should not be safe
For these base bondmen to the yoke of Rome. Ay, that’s my boy! Thy father hath full oft
For his ungrateful country done the like. YOUNG LUCIUS And, uncle, so will I, an if I live. Come go with me into mine armoury.
Lucius, I’ll fit thee; and withal, my boy,
Shall carry from me to the Empress’ sons
Presents that I intend to send them both.
Come, come, thou’lt do my message, wilt thou not?
