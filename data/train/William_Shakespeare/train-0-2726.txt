Fight and be valiant; vanquish where thou com’st. COMTE D’ARTOIS Edward Plantagenet, Prince of Wales,
Hold, take this target; wear it on thy arm.
And may the view thereof, like Perseus’ shield,
Astonish and transform thy gazing foes
To senseless images of meagre death. The shield is given to the Prince of Wales
