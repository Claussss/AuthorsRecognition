Be of good comfort, Prince, for you are born
To set a form upon that indigest
Which he hath left so shapeless and so rude. King John is brought in, with Lord Bigot attending Ay marry, now my soul hath elbow-room;
It would not out at windows nor at doors.
There is so hot a summer in my bosom
That all my bowels crumble up to dust;
I am a scribbled form, drawn with a pen
Upon a parchment, and against this fire
Do I shrink up.
