How, a kingâ€™s daughter, And called Marina? You said you would believe me, But not to be a troubler of your peace I will end here. But are you flesh and blood? Have you a working pulse and are no fairy?
Motion as well? Speak on. Where were you born,
And wherefore called Marina? Called Marina For I was born at sea.
