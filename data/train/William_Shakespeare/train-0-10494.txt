Why, that was when Three crabbed months had soured themselves to death
Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
And clap thyself my love. Then didst thou utter,
‘I am yours for ever.’ ’Tis grace indeed. Why lo you now; I have spoke to th’ purpose twice.
The one for ever earned a royal husband;
Th’other, for some while a friend.
