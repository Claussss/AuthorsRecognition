Yet I wish, sir I mean for your particular—you had not
Joined in commission with him, but either
Have borne the action of yourself or else
To him had left it solely. I understand thee well, and be thou sure,
When he shall come to his account, he knows not
What I can urge against him. Although it seems—
And so he thinks, and is no less apparent
To th’ vulgar eye—that he bears all things fairly
And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,
Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon
As draw his sword, yet he hath left undone
That which shall break his neck or hazard mine
Whene’er we come to our account.
