By all our friendship, sir, by all our dangers,
By all you love most: wars, and this sweet lady— By that you would have trembled to deny
A blushing maid— By your own eyes, by strength—
 In which you swore I went beyond all women,
Almost all men—and yet I yielded, Theseus— To crown all this, by your most noble soul,
Which cannot want due mercy, I beg first—
