I likewise hear that Valentine is dead. And so suppose am I, for in his grave,
Assure thyself, my love is buried. Sweet lady, let me rake it from the earth. Go to thy lady’s grave and call hers thence,
Or at the least, in hers sepulchre thine. JULIA (aside) He heard not that. Madam, if your heart be so obdurate,
Vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love,
The picture that is hanging in your chamber.
To that I’ll speak, to that I’ll sigh and weep;
For since the substance of your perfect self
Is else devoted, I am but a shadow,
And to your shadow will I make true love.
