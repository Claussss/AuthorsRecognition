Uncertain favour! My fault being nothing, as I have told you oft,
But that two villains, whose false oaths prevailed
Before my perfect honour, swore to Cymbeline
I was confederate with the Romans. So
Followed my banishment, and this twenty years
This rock and these demesnes have been my world,
Where I have lived at honest freedom, paid
More pious debts to heaven than in all
The fore-end of my time. But up to th’ mountains!
This is not hunter’s language. He that strikes
The venison first shall be the lord o’th’ feast,
To him the other two shall minister,
And we will fear no poison which attends
In place of greater state. I’ll meet you in the valleys.
