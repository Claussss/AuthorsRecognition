HARRY PERCY No, my good lord; he hath forsook the court,
Broken his staff of office, and dispersed
The household of the King. NORTHUMBERLAND What was his reason? He was not so resolved when last we spake together. HARRY PERCY Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor.
But he, my lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh
To offer service to the Duke of Hereford,
And sent me over by Berkeley to discover
What power the Duke of York had levied there,
Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh.
