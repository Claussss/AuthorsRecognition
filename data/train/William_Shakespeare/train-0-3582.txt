CAPULET’S WIFE Enough of this. I pray thee hold thy peace. Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh
To think it should leave crying and say ‘Ay’.
And yet, I warrant, it had upon it brow
A bump as big as a young cock‘rel’s stone.
A perilous knock, and it cried bitterly.
‘Yea,’ quoth my husband, ‘fall’st upon thy face?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou com’st to age,
Wilt thou not, Jule?’ It stinted and said ‘Ay’.
