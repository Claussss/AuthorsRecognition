GONORIL (aside) I had rather lose the battle than that sister
Should loosen him and me. ALBANY (to Regan) Our very loving sister, well bemet,
For this I hear: the King is come to his daughter,
With others whom the rigour of our state
Forced to cry out. Where I could not be honest
I never yet was valiant. For this business,
It touches us as France invades our land;
Yet boldâ€™s the King, with others whom I fear.
Most just and heavy causes make oppose.
