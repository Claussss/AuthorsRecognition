It seems you loved not her, to leave her token.
She is dead belike? PROTEUS Not so. I think she lives. Proteus Why dost thou cry ‘Alas’? I cannot choose but pity her. Wherefore shouldst thou pity her? Because methinks that she loved you as well
As you do love your lady Silvia.
She dreams on him that has forgot her love;
You dote on her that cares not for your love.
‘Tis pity love should be so contrary,
And thinking on it makes me cry ‘Alas’.
