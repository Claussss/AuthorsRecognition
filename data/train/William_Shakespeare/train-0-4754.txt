I beseech your majesty, make up,
Lest your retirement do amaze your friends. I will do so. My lord of Westmorland,
Lead him to his tent. WESTMORLAND (to the Prince) Come, my lord, I’ll lead you to your tent. PRINCE HARRY Lead me, my lord? I do not need your help,
And God forbid a shallow scratch should drive
The Prince of Wales from such a field as this,
Where stained nobility lies trodden on,
And rebels’ arms triumph in massacres.
