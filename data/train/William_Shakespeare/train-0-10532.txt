But I’d say he had not, And I’ll be sworn you would believe my saying,
Howe’er you lean to th’ nayward. You, my lords, Look on her, mark her well. Be but about
To say she is a goodly lady, and
The justice of your hearts will thereto add
“Tis pity she’s not honest, honourable.’
Praise her but for this her without-door form—
Which on my faith deserves high speech—and
straight
The shrug, the ‘hum’ or ‘ha’, these petty brands
That calumny doth use—O, I am out,
That mercy does, for calumny will sear
Virtue itself—these shrugs, these ‘hum’s’ and ‘ha’s’,
When you have said she’s goodly, come between
Ere you can say she’s honest. But be’t known
From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,
She’s an adultress.
