He waves his sword  Wave thus to express his disposition,
And follow Martius. They all shout and wave their swords, then sometake him up in their arms and they cast up their caps O’ me alone, make you a sword of me?
If these shows be not outward, which of you
But is four Volsces? None of you but is
Able to bear against the great Aufidius
A shield as hard as his. A certain number—
Though thanks to all—must I select from all.
The rest shall bear the business in some other fight
As cause will be obeyed. Please you to march,
And I shall quickly draw out my command,
Which men are best inclined.
