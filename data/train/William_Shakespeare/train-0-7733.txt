Give no respect, dear madam, to fond dreams.
They are but slight illusions of the blood. Tell me not all are so, for often dreams
Are true diviners, either of good or ill.
I cannot be in quiet till I hear
How my lord fares. ROPER (aside) Nor I.â€”Come hither, wife. I will not fright thy mother to interpret
The nature of a dream; but, trust me, sweet,
This night I have been troubled with thy father
Beyond all thought.
