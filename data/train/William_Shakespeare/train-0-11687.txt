CARDINAL WOLSEY Good Lord Chamberlain, Go give ’em welcome—you can speak the French
tongue.
And pray receive ’em nobly, and conduct ’em
Into our presence where this heaven of beauty
Shall shine at full upon them. Some attend him. Exit Chamberlain, attended All rise, and some servants remove the tables
