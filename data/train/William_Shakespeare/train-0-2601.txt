COMTE D’ARTOIS Three sons of his, which all successively
Did sit upon their father’s regal throne,
Yet died and left no issue of their loins. KING EDWARD But was my mother sister unto those? COMTE D’ARTOIS She was, my lord, and only Isabel
Was all the daughters that this Philippe had,
Whom afterward your father took to wife.
And from the fragrant garden of her womb
Your gracious self, the flower of Europe’s hope,
Derived is inheritor to France.
But note the rancour of rebellious minds:
When thus the lineage of Beau was out
The French obscured your mother’s privilege
And, though she were the next of blood, proclaimed
Jean of the house of Valois now their king.
The reason was, they say, the realm of France
Replete with princes of great parentage
Ought not admit a governor to rule
Except he be descended of the male.
And that’s the special ground of their contempt
Wherewith they study to exclude your grace.
