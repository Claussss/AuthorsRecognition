DOLL TEARSHEET A pox damn you, you muddy rascal! Is that all the comfort you give me? SIR JOHN You make fat rascals, Mistress Doll. DOLL TEARSHEET I make them? Gluttony and diseases make them; I make them not. SIR JOHN If the cook help to make the gluttony, you help to make the diseases, Doll. We catch of you, Doll, we catch of you; grant that, my poor virtue, grant that.
