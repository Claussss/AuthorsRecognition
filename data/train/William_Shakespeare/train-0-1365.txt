Then come a God’s name. I fear no woman. And while I live, I’ll ne’er fly from a man. Here they fight and Joan la Pucelle overcomes Stay, stay thy hands! Thou art an Amazon,
And fightest with the sword of Deborah. Christ’s mother helps me, else I were too weak. Whoe‘er helps thee, ’tis thou that must help me.
Impatiently I burn with thy desire.
My heart and hands thou hast at once subdued.
Excellent Pucelle if thy name be so,
Let me thy servant, and not sovereign be.
’Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus.
