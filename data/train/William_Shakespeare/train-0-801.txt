Exeunt Witch, Southwell, Hume, and Bolingbroke, guarded (To the Duchess)
You, madam, for you are more nobly born,
Despoiled of your honour in your life,
Shall, after three daysâ€™ open penance done,
Live in your country here in banishment
With Sir John Stanley in the Isle of Man. Welcome is banishment; welcome were my death.
