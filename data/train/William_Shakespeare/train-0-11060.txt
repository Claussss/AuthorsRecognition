The gods defend her!—Bear him hence a while. Exeunt some with Edmond Enter King Lear with Queen Cordelia in his arms,
followed by the Gentleman Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stones.
Had I your tongues and eyes, I’d use them so
That heaven’s vault should crack. She’s gone for ever.
I know when one is dead and when one lives.
She’s dead as earth.
