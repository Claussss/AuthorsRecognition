IAGO For Michael Cassio, I dare be sworn I think that he is honest. I think so too. IAGO Men should be what they seem, Or those that be not, would they might seem none. Certain, men should be what they seem. Why then, I think Cassio’s an honest man. OTHELLO Nay, yet there’s more in this. I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings,
As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts
The worst of words.
