Then here I take my leave of thee, fair son,
Born to eclipse thy life this afternoon.
Come, side by side together live and die,
And soul with soul from France to heaven fly. Exeunt 4.6
Alarum. Excursions, wherein Lord TalbotThe English drive off the French Saint George and victory! Fight, soldiers, fight!
The Regent hath with Talbot broke his word,
And left us to the rage of France his sword.
Where is John Talbot? (To John) Pause and take thy
breath.
I gave thee life, and rescued thee from death.
