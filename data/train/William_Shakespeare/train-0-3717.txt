There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk. O, he is even in my mistress’ case,
Just in her case! O woeful sympathy,
Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
Blubb’ring and weeping, weeping and blubb’ring.

For Juliet’s sake, for her sake, rise and stand.
Why should you fall into so deep an O?
