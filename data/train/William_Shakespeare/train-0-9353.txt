MENAS Pray ye, sir? ENOBARBUS â€™Tis true. MENAS Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together. ENOBARBUS If I were bound to divine of this unity I would not prophesy so.

But you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity. Octavia is of a holy, cold, and still conversation.
