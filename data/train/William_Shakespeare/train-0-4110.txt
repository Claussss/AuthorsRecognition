As true as I believe you think them false
That give you cause to prove my saying true. O, if thou teach me to believe this sorrow,
Teach thou this sorrow how to make me die;
And let belief and life encounter so
As doth the fury of two desperate men
Which in the very meeting fall and die.
Louis marry Blanche! (To Arthur) O boy, then where
art thou?
France friend with England!â€”What becomes of me?
(To Salisbury) Fellow, be gone, I cannot brook thy
sight; 36
This news hath made thee a most ugly man.
