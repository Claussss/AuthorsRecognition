PORTIA You must take your chance, And either not attempt to choose at all,
Or swear before you choose, if you choose wrong
Never to speak to lady afterward
In way of marriage. Therefore be advised. Nor will not. Come, bring me unto my chance. First, forward to the temple. After dinner
Your hazard shall be made.
