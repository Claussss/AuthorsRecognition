ROSENCRANTZ Both your majesties
Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
Put your dread pleasures more into command
Than to entreaty. GUILDENSTERN But we both obey,
And here give up ourselves in the full bent
To lay our service freely at your feet
To be commanded. KING CLAUDIUS Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
