Which of you two did dine with me today? ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE I, gentle mistress. ADRIANA And are not you my husband? ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS No, I say nay to that. ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE And so do I. Yet did she call me so;
And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,
Did call me brother. (To
Luciana) What I told you then
I hope I shall have leisure to make good,
If this be not a dream I see and hear.
