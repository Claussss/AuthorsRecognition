Enter Count Melun, wounded, led by a soldier Lead me to the revolts of England here. When we were happy, we had other names. It is the Count Melun. SALISBURY Wounded to death. Fly, noble English, you are bought and sold.
Unthread the rude eye of rebellion,
And welcome home again discarded faith;
Seek out King John and fall before his feet,
For if the French be lords of this loud day
He means to recompense the pains you take
By cutting off your heads. Thus hath he sworn,
And I with him, and many more with me,
Upon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury,
Even on that altar where we swore to you
Dear amity and everlasting love.
