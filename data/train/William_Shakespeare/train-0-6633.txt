Let this be so. His means of death, his obscure burial—
No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o‘er his bones,
No noble rite nor formal ostentation—
Cry to be heard, as ’twere from heaven to earth,
That I must call’t in question. KING CLAUDIUS So you shall; And where th’offence is, let the great axe fall.
I pray you go with me.
