KING RICHARD The time to come. QUEEN ELIZABETH That thou hast wronged in the time o‘erpast,
For I myself have many tears to wash
Hereafter time, for time past wronged by thee.
The children live, whose fathers thou hast slaughtered—
Ungoverned youth, to wail it in their age.
The parents live, whose children thou hast butchered—
Old barren plants, to wail it with their age.
Swear not by time to come, for that thou hast
Misused ere used, by times ill-used o’erpast.
