O, I have heard him speak of that same brother,
And he did render him the most unnatural
That lived amongst men. OLIVER And well he might so do, For well I know he was unnatural. But to Orlando. Did he leave him there,
Food to the sucked and hungry lioness? Twice did he turn his back, and purposed so.
But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,
And nature, stronger than his just occasion,
Made him give battle to the lioness,
Who quickly fell before him; in which hurtling
From miserable slumber I awaked.
