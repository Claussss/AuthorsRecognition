‘My husband is thy friend; for his sake spare me.
Thyself art mighty; for thine own sake leave me;
Myself a weakling; do not then ensnare me.
Thou look’st not like deceit; do not deceive me.
My sighs like whirlwinds labour hence to heave thee. If ever man were moved with woman’s moans,
Be moved with my tears, my sighs, my groans.
