LEAR I gave you all. REGAN And in good time you gave it. Made you my guardians, my depositaries,
But kept a reservation to be followed
With such a number. What, must I come to you
With five-and-twenty? Regan, said you so? And speak’t again, my lord. No more with me. Those wicked creatures yet do look well favoured
When others are more wicked. Not being the worst
Stands in some rank of praise. (To Goneril) I’ll go with
thee.
Thy fifty yet doth double five-and-twenty,
And thou art twice her love.
