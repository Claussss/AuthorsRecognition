FRIAR LAURENCE Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak. O, thou wilt speak again of banishment. FRIAR LAURENCE I’ll give thee armour to keep off that word—
Adversity’s sweet milk, philosophy,
To comfort thee though thou art banished. Yet 
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
Displant a town, reverse a prince’s doom,
It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.
