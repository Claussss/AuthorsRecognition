Enter Cassandra CASSANDRA Where is my brother Hector? Here, sister, armed and bloody in intent.
Consort with me in loud and dear petition,
Pursue we him on knees—for I have dreamed
Of bloody turbulence, and this whole night
Hath nothing been but shapes and forms of slaughter. O ’tis true. HECTOR Ho! Bid my trumpet sound.
