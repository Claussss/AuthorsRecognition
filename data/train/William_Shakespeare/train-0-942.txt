Such aid as I can spare you shall command,
But I am troubled here with them myself.
The rebels have essayed to win the Tower.
Get you to Smithfield, there to gather head,
And thither will I send you Matthew Gough.
Fight for your king, your country, and your lives!
And so, farewell, for I must hence again.
