BARDE Go with me quietly, or I’ll compel thee. DOLL Compel me, ye dog’s face? Thou think‘st thou hast the goldsmith’s wife in hand, whom thou enticed’st from her husband with all his plate, and when thou turned‘st her home to him again mad’st him, like an ass, pay for his wife’s board. BARDE So will I make thy husband too, if please me.
