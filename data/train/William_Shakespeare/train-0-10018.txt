Thy oath remember. Thou hast sworn to do’t.
‘Tis but a blow, which never shall be known.
Thou canst not do a thing i’th’ world so soon
To yield thee so much profit. Let not conscience,
Which is but cold, or fanning love thy bosom
Unflame too nicely, nor let pity, which
E’en women have cast off, melt thee; but be
A soldier to thy purpose.
