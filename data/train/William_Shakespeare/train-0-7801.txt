HANGMAN My lord, I pray ye put off your doublet. 115 Speak not so coldly to me; I am hoarse already.
I would be loath, good fellow, to take more.
Point me the block; I ne’er was here before. To the east side, my lord. MORE Then to the east. We go to sigh; that o’er, to sleep in rest.
Here More forsakes all mirth; good reason why:
The fool of flesh must with her frail life die.
No eye salute my trunk with a sad tear.
Our birth to heaven should be thus: void of fear.
