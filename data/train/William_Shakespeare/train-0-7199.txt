Fair Diomed, you do as chapmen do:
Dispraise the thing that you desire to buy.
But we in silence hold this virtue well:
We’ll but commend what we intend to sell.—
Here lies our way. Exeunt  4.2
Enter Troilus and Cressida Dear, trouble not yourself. The morn is cold. Then, sweet my lord, I’ll call mine uncle down.
He shall unbolt the gates.
