Change it, change it. Be not so holy-cruel. Love is holy,
And my integrity ne’er knew the crafts
That you do charge men with. Stand no more off,
But give thyself unto my sick desires,
Who then recovers. Say thou art mine, and ever
My love as it begins shall so persever. I see that men make toys e’en such a surance
That we’ll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring.
