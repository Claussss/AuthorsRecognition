Beauty, truth, and rarity,
Grace in all simplicity,
Here enclosed in cinders lie.
Death is now the phoenix’ nest,
And the turtle’s loyal breast
To eternity doth rest.
Leaving no posterity
’Twas not their infirmity,
It was married chastity. Truth may seem but cannot be,
Beauty brag, but ’tis not she.
Truth and beauty buried be.
To this urn let those repair
That are either true or fair.
For these dead birds sigh a prayer.
Verses upon the Stanley Tomb at Tong
Written upon the east end of the tomb
Ask who lies here, but do not weep.
He is not dead; he doth but sleep.
This stony register is for his bones;
His fame is more perpetual than these stones,
And his own goodness, with himself being gone,
Shall live when earthly monument is none.
