QUEEN MARGARET No, mighty King of France, now Margaret
Must strike her sail and learn a while to serve
Where kings command. I was, I must confess,
Great Albionâ€™s queen in former golden days,
But now mischance hath trod my title down,
And with dishonour laid me on the ground,
Where I must take like seat unto my fortune
And to my humble state conform myself.
