KING SIMONIDES I shall prove otherwise, since both your practice
And her consent therein is evident
There, by my daughter’s hand, as she can witness. Enter Thaisa PERICLES (to Thaisa) Then as you are as virtuous as fair,
By what you hope of heaven or desire
By your best wishes here i‘th’ world fulfilled,
Resolve your angry father if my tongue
Did e’er solicit, or my hand subscribe
To any syllable made love to you.
