never tire.
Enter Robin leadingBottom with the ass-head BOTTOM (as Pyramus) If I were fair, Thisbe, I were only thine. QUINCE O monstrousl O strange! We are haunted. Pray, masters; fly, masters: help! The clowns all exeunt I’ll follow you, I’ll lead you about a round,
Through bog, through bush, through brake,
through brier.
Sometime a horse I’ll be, sometime a hound,
A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire,
And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,
Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn. Exit
