QUEEN MARGARET Ay, good my lord, for purposely therefor
Left I the court to see this quarrel tried. A Godâ€™s name, see the lists and all things fit;
Here let them end it, and God defend the right. I never saw a fellow worse bestead,
Or more afraid to fight, than is the appellant,
The servant of this armourer, my lords.
