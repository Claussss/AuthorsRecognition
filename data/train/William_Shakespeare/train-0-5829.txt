KING HARRY I tell thee truly, herald, I know not if the day be ours or no,
For yet a many of your horsemen peer
And gallop oâ€™er the field. MONTJOY The day is yours. Praised be God, and not our strength, for it.
What is this castle called that stands hard by? MONTJOY They call it Agincourt. Then call we this the field of Agincourt,
Fought on the day of Crispin Crispian.
