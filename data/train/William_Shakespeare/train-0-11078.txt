SECOND GENTLEMAN You speak him far. FIRST GENTLEMAN I do extend him, sir, within himself;
Crush him together rather than unfold
His measure duly. SECOND GENTLEMAN What’s his name and birth? FIRST GENTLEMAN I cannot delve him to the root. His father
Was called Sicilius, who did join his honour
Against the Romans with Cassibelan
But had his titles by Tenantius, whom
He served with glory and admired success,
So gained the sur-addition ‘Leonatus’;
And had, besides this gentleman in question,
Two other sons who in the wars o‘th’ time
Died with their swords in hand; for which their father,
Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow
That he quit being, and his gentle lady,
Big of this gentleman, our theme, deceased
As he was born. The King, he takes the babe
To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,
Breeds him, and makes him of his bedchamber;
Puts to him all the learnings that his time
Could make him the receiver of, which he took
As we do air, fast as ’twas ministered,
And in ’s spring became a harvest; lived in court—
Which rare it is to do—most praised, most loved;
A sample to the youngest, to th’ more mature
A glass that feated them, and to the graver
A child that guided dotards. To his mistress,
For whom he now is banished, her own price
Proclaims how she esteemed him and his virtue.
By her election may be truly read
What kind of man he is.
