Enter Leonato and Antonio, an old man brother to Leonato, severally 
LEONATO How now, brother, where is my cousin, your son? Hath he provided this music? ANTONIO, He is very busy about it. But brother, I can tell you strange news that you yet dreamt not of. LEONATO Are they good? ANTONIO, As the event stamps them. But they have a good cover, they show well outward. The Prince and Count Claudio, walking in a thick-pleached alley in mine orchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine: the Prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my niece, your daughter, and meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance, and if he found her accordant he meant to take the present time by the top and instantly break with you of it.
