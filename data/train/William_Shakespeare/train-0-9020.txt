SECOND WITCH Show me, show me. FIRST WITCH Here I have a pilot’s thumb,
Wrecked as homeward he did come. Drum within THIRD WITCH A drum, a drum—
Macbeth doth come. ALL (dancing in a ring) The weird sisters hand in hand,
Posters of the sea and land,
Thus do go about, about,
Thrice to thine, and thrice to mine,
And thrice again to make up nine.
Peace! The charm’s wound up.
