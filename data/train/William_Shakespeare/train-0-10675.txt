I am bound to you. There is some sap in this. A course more promising Than a wild dedication of yourselves
To unpathed waters, undreamed shores; most certain,
To miseries enough—no hope to help you,
But as you shake off one, to take another;
Nothing so certain as your anchors, who
Do their best office if they can but stay you
Where you’ll be loath to be. Besides, you know,
Prosperity’s the very bond of love,
Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together
Affliction alters.
