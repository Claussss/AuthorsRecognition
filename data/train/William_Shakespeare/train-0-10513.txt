I must believe you, sir. I do, and will fetch off Bohemia for’t,
Provided that when he’s removed your highness
Will take again your queen as yours at first,
Even for your son’s sake, and thereby for sealing
The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms
Known and allied to yours. Thou dost advise me Even so as I mine own course have set down.
I’ll give no blemish to her honour, none.
