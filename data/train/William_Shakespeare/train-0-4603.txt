SIR JOHN Where is it? Taken from us it is. A hundred upon poor four of us. PRINCE HARRY What, a hundred, man? SIR JOHN I am a rogue if I were not at half-sword with a dozen of them, two hours together. I have scaped by miracle. I am eight times thrust through the doublet, four through the hose, my buckler cut through and through, my sword hacked like a handsaw. Ecce signum.
