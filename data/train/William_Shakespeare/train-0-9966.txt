Sc. 8a
Enter Pericles with Gentlemen with lights 
FIRST GENTLEMAN Here is your lodging, sir. PERICLES Pray leave me private. Only for instant solace pleasure me
With some delightful instrument, with which,
And with my former practice, I intend
To pass away the tediousness of night, 5
Though slumbers were more fitting.
