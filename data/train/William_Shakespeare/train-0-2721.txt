PRINCE PHILIPPE (to the King of France) Father, range your battles. Prate no more.
These English fain would spend the time in words
That, night approaching, they might scape unfought. KING OF FRANCE Lords and my loving subjects, now’s the time
That your intended force must bide the touch.
Therefore, my friends, consider this in brief.
He that you fight for is your natural king;
He against whom you fight a foreigner.
He that you fight for rules in clemency,
And reigns you with a mild and gentle bit;
He against whom you fight, if he prevail,
Will straight enthrone himself in tyranny,
Make slaves of you and with a heavy hand
Curtail and curb your sweetest liberty.
Then, to protect your country and your King,
Let but the haughty courage of your hearts
Answer the number of your able hands,
And we shall quickly chase these fugitives.
For what’s this Edward but a belly-god,
A tender and lascivious wantonness,
That th‘other day was almost dead for love?
And what, I pray you, is his goodly guard?
Such as, but scant them of their chines of beef,
And take away their downy feather beds,
And presently they are as resty-stiff
As ’twere a many overridden jades.
Then, Frenchmen, scorn that such should be your lords,
And rather bind ye them in captive bands.
