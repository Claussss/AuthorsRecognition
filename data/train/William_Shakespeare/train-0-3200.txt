But shall we dance if they desire us to’t? No, to the death we will not move a foot,
Nor to their penned speech render we no grace,
But while ’tis spoke each turn away her face. Why, that contempt will kill the speaker’s heart,
And quite divorce his memory from his part. Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt
The rest will ne‘er come in if he be out.
There’s no such sport as sport by sport o’erthrown,
To make theirs ours, and ours none but our own.
So shall we stay, mocking intended game,
And they well mocked depart away with shame.
