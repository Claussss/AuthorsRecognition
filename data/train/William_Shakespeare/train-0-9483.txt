Scarus kisses Cleopatra’s hand He hath fought today As if a god, in hate of mankind, had
Destroyed in such a shape. I’ll give thee, friend, An armour all of gold. It was a king’s. He has deserved it, were it carbuncled
Like holy Phoebus’ car. Give me thy hand.
Through Alexandria make a jolly march.
Bear our hacked targets like the men that owe them.
Had our great palace the capacity
To camp this host, we all would sup together
And drink carouses to the next day’s fate,
Which promises royal peril. Trumpeters,
With brazen din blast you the city’s ear;
Make mingle with our rattling taborins,
That heaven and earth may strike their sounds
together,
Applauding our approach.
