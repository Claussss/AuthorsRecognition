The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm. The Kingâ€™s grown bankrupt like a broken man. NORTHUMBERLAND Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him. He hath not money for these Irish wars,
His burdenous taxations notwithstanding,
But by the robbing of the banished Duke. NORTHUMBERLAND His noble kinsman. Most degenerate King!
But, lords, we hear this fearful tempest sing,
Yet seek no shelter to avoid the storm.
We see the wind sit sore upon our sails,
And yet we strike not, but securely perish.
