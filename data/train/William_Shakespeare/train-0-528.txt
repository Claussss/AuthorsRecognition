Exeunt Petruccio and Katherine, severally Was ever match clapped up so suddenly? Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant’s part,
And venture madly on a desperate mart. ‘Twas a commodity lay fretting by you.
’Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas. The gain I seek is quiet in the match. No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.
But now, Baptista, to your younger daughter.
Now is the day we long have looked for.
I am your neighbour, and was suitor first.
