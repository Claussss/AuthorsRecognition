DEMETRIUS (aside) Chiron, we hunt not, we, with horse nor hound,
But hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground. Exeunt 2.3
Enter Aaron alone, with gold He that had wit would think that I had none,
To bury so much gold under a tree
And never after to inherit it.
Let him that thinks of me so abjectly
Know that this gold must coin a stratagem
Which, cunningly effected, will beget
A very excellent piece of villainy.
And so repose, sweet gold, for their unrest
That have their alms out of the Empressâ€™ chest.
