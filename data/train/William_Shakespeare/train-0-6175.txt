Exeunt Duke Frederick, Le Beau, [Touchstone,] Lords, and attendants CELIA (to Rosalind) Were I my father, coz, would I do this? I am more proud to be Sir Rowland’s son,
His youngest son, and would not change that calling
To be adopted heir to Frederick. My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,
And all the world was of my father’s mind.
Had I before known this young man his son
I should have given him tears unto entreaties
Ere he should thus have ventured.
