CONSTABLE O peace, Prince Dauphin. You are too much mistaken in this king.
Question your grace the late ambassadors
With what great state he heard their embassy,
How well supplied with aged counsellors,
How modest in exception, and withal
How terrible in constant resolution,
And you shall find his vanities forespent
Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus,
Covering discretion with a coat of folly,
As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots
That shall first spring and be most delicate.
