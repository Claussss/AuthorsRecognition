Ay, mine own fortune in my misery. Ay, if I know the letters and the language. ROMEO Stay, fellow, I can read. He reads the letter ‘Signor Martino and his wife and daughters,
County Anselme and his beauteous sisters,
The lady widow of Vitruvio,
Signor Placentio and his lovely nieces,
Mercutio and his brother Valentine,
Mine uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters,
My fair niece Rosaline and Livia,
Signor Valentio and his cousin Tybalt,
Lucio and the lively Helena.’
A fair assembly. Whither should they come?
