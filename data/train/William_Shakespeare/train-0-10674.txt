Worthy Camillo, What colour for my visitation shall I
Hold up before him? Sent by the King your father To greet him, and to give him comforts. Sir,
The manner of your bearing towards him, with
What you, as from your father, shall deliver—
Things known betwixt us three—I’ll write you down,
The which shall point you forth at every sitting
What you must say, that he shall not perceive
But that you have your father’s bosom there,
And speak his very heart.
