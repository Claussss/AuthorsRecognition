BURGUNDY (to Lear) Royal King, Give but that portion which yourself proposed,
And here I take Cordelia by the hand,
Duchess of Burgundy. LEAR Nothing. I have sworn. I am firm. BURGUNDY (to Cordelia) I am sorry, then, you have so lost a father
That you must lose a husband. Peace be with Burgundy; Since that respect and fortunes are his love,
I shall not be his wife.
