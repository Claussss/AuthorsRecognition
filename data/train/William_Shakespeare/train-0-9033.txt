Flourish. Enter King Duncan, Lennox, Malcolm, Donalbain, and attendants 
KING DUNCAN Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not
Those in commission yet returned? They are not yet come back. But I have spoke
With one that saw him die, who did report
That very frankly he confessed his treasons,
Implored your highness’ pardon, and set forth
A deep repentance. Nothing in his life
Became him like the leaving it. He died
As one that had been studied in his death
To throw away the dearest thing he owed
As ’twere a careless trifle.
