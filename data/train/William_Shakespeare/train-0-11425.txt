Alack, what trouble Was I then to you! O,a cherubin Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile,
Infused with a fortitude from heaven,
When I have decked the sea with drops full salt,
Under my burden groaned; which raised in me
An undergoing stomach, to bear up
Against what should ensue. MIRANDA How came we ashore?
