Mark, Jew! O learned judge! SHYLOCK Is that the law? PORTIA Thyself shalt see the act; For as thou urgest justice, be assured
Thou shalt have justice more than thou desirâ€™st. I take this offer, then. Pay the bond thrice,
And let the Christian go. BASSANIO Here is the money. Soft, the Jew shall have all justice. Soft, no haste.
He shall have nothing but the penalty.
