A Midsummer Night’s Dream 1.1
Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, and Philostrate, with others Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour
Draws on apace. Four happy days bring in
Another moon—but O, methinks how slow
This old moon wanes! She lingers my desires
Like to a stepdame or a dowager
Long withering out a young man’s revenue.
