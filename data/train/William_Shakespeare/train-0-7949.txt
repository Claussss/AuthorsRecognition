Why, as all comforts are: most good, most good
indeed.
Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,
Intends you for his swift ambassador,
Where you shall be an everlasting leiger.
Therefore your best appointment make with speed.
Tomorrow you set on. Is there no remedy? None but such remedy as, to save a head,
To cleave a heart in twain.
