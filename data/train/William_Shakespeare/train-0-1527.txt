RICHARD DUKE OF YORK Alas, what joy shall noble Talbot have
To bid his young son welcome to his grave?
Away—vexation almost stops my breath
That sundered friends greet in the hour of death.
Lucy, farewell. No more my fortune can
But curse the cause I cannot aid the man.
Maine, Blois, Poitiers, and Tours are won away
’Long all of Somerset and his delay.
