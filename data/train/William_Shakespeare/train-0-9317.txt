Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale
Her infinite variety. Other women cloy
The appetites they feed, but she makes hungry
Where most she satisfies. For vilest things
Become themselves in her, that the holy priests
Bless her when she is riggish. If beauty, wisdom, modesty can settle
The heart of Antony, Octavia is
A blessed lottery to him.
