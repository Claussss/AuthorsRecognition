OLD SHEPHERD Leave your prating. Since these good men are pleased, let them come in—but quickly, now. SERVANT Why, they stay at door, sir. Here a dance of twelve satyrs POLIXENES (to the Old Shepherd) O, father, you’ll know more of that hereafter.
(To Camillo) Is it not too far gone? ’Tis time to part
them.
He’s simple, and tells much.
(To Florizel) How now, fair shepherd,
Your heart is full of something that does take
Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young
And handed love as you do, I was wont
To load my she with knacks. I would have ransacked
The pedlar’s silken treasury, and have poured it
To her acceptance. You have let him go,
And nothing marted with him. If your lass
Interpretation should abuse, and call this
Your lack of love or bounty, you were straited
For a reply, at least if you make a care
Of happy holding her.
