PROSPERO (aside) Fair encounter Of two most rare affections! Heavens rain grace
On that which breeds between ’em. FERDINAND (to Miranda) Wherefore weep you? At mine unworthiness, that dare not offer
What I desire to give, and much less take
What I shall die to want. But this is trifling,
And all the more it seeks to hide itself
The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning,
And prompt me, plain and holy innocence.
I am your wife, if you will marry me.
If not, I’ll die your maid. To be your fellow
You may deny me, but I’ll be your servant
Whether you will or no.
