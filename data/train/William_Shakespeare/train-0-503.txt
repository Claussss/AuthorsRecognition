Youâ€™re welcome, sir, and he for your good sake.
But for my daughter, Katherine, this I know:
She is not for your turn, the more my grief. I see you do not mean to part with her,
Or else you like not of my company. Mistake me not, I speak but as I find.
Whence are you, sir? What may I call your name?
