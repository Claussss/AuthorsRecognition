SERVANT I do, Mark Antony. Caesar did write for him to come to Rome. He did receive his letters, and is coming,
And bid me say to you by word of mouthâ€”
(Seeing the body) O Caesar! Thy heart is big. Get thee apart and weep.
Passion, I see, is catching, for mine eyes,
Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,
Began to water. Is thy master coming?
