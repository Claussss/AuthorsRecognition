KING EDWARD (to the King of France) So, Jean of France, I see you keep your word!
You promised to be sooner with ourself
Than we did think for, and ’tis so indeed.
But had you done at first as now you do,
How many civil towns had stood untouched
That now are turned to ragged heaps of stones?
How many people’s lives mightst thou have saved
That are untimely sunk into their graves?
