The poor, lame, blind, halt, creep, cry out for thee,
But they ne’er meet with opportunity. ‘The patient dies while the physician sleeps,
The orphan pines while the oppressor feeds,
Justice is feasting while the widow weeps,
Advice is sporting while infection breeds.
Thou grant’st no time for charitable deeds.
