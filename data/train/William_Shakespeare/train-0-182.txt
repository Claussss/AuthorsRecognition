John Milton (1630), in Comedies, Histories, and Tragedies (1632) 
Upon the Effigies of my Worthy Friend, the Author Master William Shakespeare, and his Works Spectator, this life’s shadow is. To see
The truer image and a livelier he,
Turn reader. But observe his comic vein,
Laugh; and proceed next to a tragic strain,
Then weep. So when thou find’st two contraries,
Two different passions from thy rapt soul rise,
Say—who alone effect such wonders could—
Rare Shakespeare to the life thou dost behold.
