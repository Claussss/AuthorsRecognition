VALENTINE I have loved her ever since I saw her, and still I see her beautiful. SPEED If you love her you cannot see her. VALENTINE Why? SPEED Because love is blind. O that you had mine eyes, or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going ungartered. VALENTINE What should I see then?
