â€™Tis better said than done, my gracious lord.
I am a subject fit to jest withal,
But far unfit to be a sovereign. KING EDWARD Sweet widow, by my state I swear to thee
I speak no more than what my soul intends,
And that is to enjoy thee for my love. And that is more than I will yield unto.
I know I am too mean to be your queen,
And yet too good to be your concubine.
