I know a discontented gentleman
Whose humble means match not his haughty spirit.
Gold were as good as twenty orators,
And will no doubt tempt him to anything. KING RICHARD What is his name? His name, my lord, is Tyrrell. KING RICHARD I partly know the man. Go call him hither, boy. Aside
No more shall be the neighbour to my counsels.
Hath he so long held out with me untired,
And stops he now for breath? Well, be it so.
