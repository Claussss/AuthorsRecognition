Before we make election, give me leave
To show some reason of no little force
That York is most unmeet of any man. I’ll tell thee, Suffolk, why I am unmeet:
First, for I cannot flatter thee in pride;
Next, if I be appointed for the place,
My lord of Somerset will keep me here
Without discharge, money, or furniture,
Till France be won into the Dauphin’s hands.
Last time I danced attendance on his will
Till Paris was besieged, famished, and lost.
