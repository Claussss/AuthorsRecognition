Then cursed she Hastings; then cursed she Buckingham;
Then cursed she Richard. O remember, God,
To hear her prayer for them as now for us.
And for my sister and her princely sons,
Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood,
Which, as thou knowâ€™st, unjustly must be spilt. Make haste: the hour of death is expiate.
