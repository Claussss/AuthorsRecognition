Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him.
He never did encounter with Glynd
He durst as well have met the devil alone
As Owain Glynd
Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth
Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer.
Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,
Or you shall hear in such a kind from me
As will displease you.—My lord Northumberland,
We license your departure with your son.
(To Hotspur) Send us your prisoners, or you’ll hear of it.
