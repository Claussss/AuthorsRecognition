to Valeria) And live you yet? O my sweet lady, pardon. I know not where to turn. O, welcome home!
And welcome, general, and you’re welcome all! A hundred thousand welcomes! I could weep
And I could laugh, I am light and heavy. Welcome!
A curse begnaw at very root on’s heart
That is not glad to see thee. You are three
That Rome should dote on. Yet, by the faith of men,
We have some old crab-trees here at home that will not
Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors!
We call a nettle but a nettle, and
The faults of fools but folly.
