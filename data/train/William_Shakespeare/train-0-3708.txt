NURSE (taking up the cords) Hie to your chamber. I’ll find Romeo
To comfort you. I wot well where he is.
Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.
I’ll to him. He is hid at Laurence’ cell. JULIET (giving her a ring) O, find him! Give this ring to my true knight,
And bid him come to take his last farewell.
