The Duke of Lancaster and Westmorland;
Against the Welsh, himself and Harry Monmouth;
But who is substituted ’gainst the French
I have no certain notice. ARCHBISHOP OF YORK Let us on, And publish the occasion of our arms.
The commonwealth is sick of their own choice;
Their over-greedy love hath surfeited.
An habitation giddy and unsure
Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart.
O thou fond many, with what loud applause
Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke,
Before he was what thou wouldst have him be I
And being now trimmed in thine own desires,
Thou, beastly feeder, art so full of him
That thou provok‘st thyself to cast him up.
So, so, thou common dog, didst thou disgorge
Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard;
And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up,
And howl’st to find it. What trust is in these times ?
They that when Richard lived would have him die
Are now become enamoured on his grave.
Thou that threw‘st dust upon his goodly head,
When through proud London he came sighing on
After th’admired heels of Bolingbroke,
Cri’st now, ‘O earth, yield us that king again,
And take thou this!’ O thoughts of men accursed!
Past and to come seems best; things present, worst.
