ALBANY Which is that adversary? What’s he that speaks for Edmund, Earl of Gloucester? Himself. What sayst thou to him? EDGAR Draw thy sword, That if my speech offend a noble heart
Thy arm may do thee justice. Here is mine.
He draws his sword
Behold, it is the privilege of my tongue,
My oath, and my profession. I protest,
Maugre thy strength, youth, place, and eminence,
Despite thy victor-sword and fire-new fortune,
Thy valour and thy heart, thou art a traitor,
False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father,
Conspirant ‘gainst this high illustrious prince,
And from th’extremest upward of thy head
To the descent and dust beneath thy feet
A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou no,
This sword, this arm, and my best spirits are bent
To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,
Thou liest.
