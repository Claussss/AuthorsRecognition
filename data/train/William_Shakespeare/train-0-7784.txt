Ah husband, husband, yet submit yourself.
Have care of your poor wife and children. Wife, so I have, and I do leave you all
To His protection hath the power to keep
You safer than I can,
The father of the widow and the orphan. The world, my lord, hath ever held you wise,
And â€™t shall be no distaste unto your wisdom
To yield to the opinion of the state.
