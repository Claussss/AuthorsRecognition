That is her ransom. I deliver her,
And those two counties I will undertake
Your grace shall well and quietly enjoy. And I again in Henry’s royal name,
As deputy unto that gracious king,
Give thee her hand for sign of plighted faith. Ren
Because this is in traffic of a king.
(Aside) And yet methinks I could be well content
To be mine own attorney in this case.
(To Ren I’ll over then to England with this news,
And make this marriage to be solemnized.
So farewell, Ren
In golden palaces, as it becomes.
