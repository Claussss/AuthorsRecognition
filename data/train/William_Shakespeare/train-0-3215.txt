LONGUEVILLE One word in private with you ere I die. Bleat softly, then. The butcher hears you cry. Longueville and Catherine talk apart The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen
As is the razorâ€™s edge invisible,
Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen,
Above the sense of sense; so sensible
Seemeth their conference. Their conceits have wings
Fleeter than arrows, bullets, wind, thought, swifter things.
