GONORIL Prescribe not us our duties. REGAN Let your study Be to content your lord, who hath received you
At fortuneâ€™s alms. You have obedience scanted,
And well are worth the worst that you have wanted. Time shall unfold what pleated cunning hides.
Who covers faults, at last shame them derides.
Well may you prosper.
