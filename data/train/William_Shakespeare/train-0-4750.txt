Enter Prince Harry But who comes here? PRINCE HARRY What, standâ€™st thou idle here? Lend me thy sword.
Many a noble man lies stark and stiff
Under the hoofs of vaunting enemies,
Whose deaths as yet are unrevenged. I prithee
Lend me thy sword. O Hal, I prithee give me leave to breathe awhile.
Turk Gregory never did such deeds in arms
As I have done this day. I have paid Percy,
I have made him sure.
