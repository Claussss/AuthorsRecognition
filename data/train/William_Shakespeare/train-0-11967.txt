THIRD QUEEN This funeral path brings to your household’s grave—
Joy seize on you again, peace sleep with him. SECOND QUEEN And this to yours. FIRST QUEEN Yours this way. Heavens lend A thousand differing ways to one sure end. THIRD QUEEN This world’s a city full of straying streets,
And death’s the market-place where each one meets.
