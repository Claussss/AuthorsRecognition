ANTONIO I am dumb! BASSANIO (to Portia) Were you the doctor and I knew you not? GRAZIANO (to Nerissa) Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold? Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it
Unless he live until he be a man. BASSANIO (to Portia) Sweet doctor, you shall be my bedfellow.
When I am absent, then lie with my wife.
