LINCOLN and GEORGE BETTS Peace, peace, silence, peace! You that have voice and credit with the number,
Command them to a stillness. LINCOLN A plague on them, they will not hold their peace. The devil cannot rule them. Then what a rough and riotous charge have you
To lead those that the devil cannot rule.â€”
Good masters, hear me speak.
