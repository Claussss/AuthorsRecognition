Petruccio, Hortensio, and Grumio stand aside GREMIO (to Lucentio) O, very well—I have perused the note.
Hark you, sir, I’ll have them very fairly bound—
All books of love, see that at any hand—
And see you read no other lectures to her.

Signor Baptista’s liberality,
I’ll mend it with a largess. Take your paper, too,
And let me have them very well perfumed,
For she is sweeter than perfume itself
To whom they go to. What will you read to her?
