And on a love-book pray for my success? Upon some book I love I’ll pray for thee. That’s on some shallow story of deep love—
How young Leander crossed the Hellespont. That’s a deep story of a deeper love,
For he was more than over-shoes in love. ‘Tis true, for you are over-boots in love,
And yet you never swam the Hellespont.
