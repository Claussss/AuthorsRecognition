RICHARD GLOUCESTER Where it seems best unto your royal self.
If I may counsel you, some day or two
Your highness shall repose you at the Tower,
Then where you please and shall be thought most fit
For your best health and recreation. PRINCE EDWARD I do not like the Tower of any place.â€”
Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?
