Enter Demetrius and Helena, running
HELENA Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius. I charge thee hence, and do not haunt me thus. O, wilt thou darkling leave me? Do not so. Stay, on thy peril; I alone will go. Exit O, I am out of breath in this fond chase.
The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.
Happy is Hermia, wheresoe‘er she lies;
For she hath blessed and attractive eyes.
How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears—
If so, my eyes are oft’ner washed than hers.
No, no; I am as ugly as a bear, 100
For beasts that meet me run away for fear.
Therefore no marvel though Demetrius
Do, as a monster, fly my presence thus.
What wicked and dissembling glass of mine
Made me compare with Hermia’s sphery eyne!
But who is here? Lysander, on the ground?
Dead, or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.
Lysander, if you live, good sir, awake.
