CARDINAL CAMPEIUS Hath spoken well and justly. Therefore, madam,
It’s fit this royal session do proceed,
And that without delay their arguments
Be now produced and heard. QUEEN KATHERINE (to Wolsey) Lord Cardinal, To you I speak. CARDINAL WOLSEY Your pleasure, madam. QUEEN KATHERINE I am about to weep, but thinking that
We are a queen, or long have dreamed so, certain
The daughter of a king, my drops of tears
I’ll turn to sparks of fire.
