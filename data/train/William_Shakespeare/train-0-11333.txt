No more, thou thunder-master, show
Thy spite on mortal flies.
With Mars fall out, with Juno chide,
That thy adulteries
Rates and revenges.
Hath my poor boy done aught but well,
Whose face I never saw?
I died whilst in the womb he stayed,
Attending nature’s law,
Whose father then-as men report
Thou orphans’ father art-
Thou shouldst have been, and shielded him
From this earth-vexing smart.
