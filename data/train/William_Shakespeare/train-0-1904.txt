QUEEN MARGARET (aside) Ay, and much better blood than his or thine. RICHARD GLOUCESTER (to Elizabeth) In all which time you and your husband Gray
Were factious for the house of Lancaster;
And Rivers, so were you.—Was not your husband
In Margaret’s battle at Saint Albans slain?
Let me put in your minds, if you forget,
What you have been ere this, and what you are;
Withal, what I have been, and what I am.
