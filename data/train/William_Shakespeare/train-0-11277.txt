So worthy as thy birth. Art not afeard? Those that I reverence, those I fear, the wise.
At fools I laugh, not fear them. CLOTEN Die the death. When I have slain thee with my proper hand
I’ll follow those that even now fled hence,
And on the gates of Lud’s town set your heads.
Yield, rustic mountaineer.
