Enter all the Lords, among them old Helicanus, to Pericles Joy and all comfort in your sacred breast! SECOND LORD And keep your mind peaceful and comfortable. Peace, peace, and give experience tongue.
(To Pericles) You do not well so to abuse yourself,
To waste your body here with pining sorrow,
Upon whose safety doth depend the lives
And the prosperity of a whole kingdom.
‘Tis ill in you to do it, and no less
ll in your council not to contradict it.
They do abuse the King that flatter him,
For flatt’ry is the bellows blows up sin;
The thing the which is flattered, but a spark,
To which that wind gives heat and stronger glowing;
Whereas reproof, obedient and in order,
Fits kings as they are men, for they may err.
When Signor Sooth here does proclaim a peace
He flatters you, makes war upon your life.
