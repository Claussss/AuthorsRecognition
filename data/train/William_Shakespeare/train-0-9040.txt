The King comes here tonight. LADY MACBETH Thou’t mad to say it. Is not thy master with him, who, were’t so,
Would have informed for preparation? So please you, it is true. Our thane is coming,
One of my fellows had the speed of him,
Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more
Than would make up his message.
