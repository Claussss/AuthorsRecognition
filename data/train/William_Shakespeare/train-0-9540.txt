Arise! You shall not kneel. I pray you rise, rise, Egypt. CLEOPATRA (rising) Sir, the gods Will have it thus. My master and my lord
I must obey. Take to you no hard thoughts. The record of what injuries you did us,
Though written in our flesh, we shall remember
As things but done by chance. Sole sir o’th’ world, I cannot project mine own cause so well
To make it clear, but do confess I have
Been laden with like frailties which before
Have often shamed our sex.
