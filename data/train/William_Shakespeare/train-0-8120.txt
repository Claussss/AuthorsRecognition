The Tragedy of Othello the Moor of Venice 1.1
Enter Iago and Roderigo Tush, never tell me! I take it much unkindly
That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse
As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this. IAGO ’Sblood, but you’ll not hear me! If ever I did dream of such a matter, abhor me. Thou told’st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.
