Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear—
For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine
Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry’s head
And wring the aweful sceptre from his fist,
Were he as famous and as bold in war
As he is famed for mildness, peace, and prayer. I know it well, Lord Warwick—blame me not.
‘Tis love I bear thy glories make me speak.
But in this troublous time what’s to be done?
Shall we go throw away our coats of steel,
And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,
Numb’ring our Ave-Maries with our beads?
Or shall we on the helmets of our foes
Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?
If for the last, say ‘ay’, and to it, lords.
