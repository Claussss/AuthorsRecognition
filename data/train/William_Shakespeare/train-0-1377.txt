What, am I dared and bearded to my face?
Draw, men, for all this privileged place. All draw their swords Blue coats to tawny coats!—Priest, beware your
beard.
I mean to tug it, and to cuff you soundly.
Under my feet I’ll stamp thy bishop’s mitre.
In spite of Pope, or dignities of church,
Here by the cheeks I’ll drag thee up and down.
