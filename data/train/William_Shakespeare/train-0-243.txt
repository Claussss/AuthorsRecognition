VALENTINE Are all these things perceived in me? SPEED They are all perceived without ye. VALENTINE Without me? They cannot. SPEED Without you? Nay, thatâ€™s certain, for without you were so simple, none else would. But you are so without these follies that these follies are within you, and shine through you like the water in an urinal, that not an eye that sees you but is a physician to comment on your malady.
