CARDINAL WOLSEY All goodness Is poison to thy stomach. Yes, that goodness Of gleaning all the land’s wealth into one,
Into your own hands, Card’nal, by extortion;
The goodness of your intercepted packets
You writ to th’ Pope against the King; your
goodness—
Since you provoke me—shall be most notorious.
My lord of Norfolk, as you are truly noble,
As you respect the common good, the state
Of our despised nobility, our issues—
Whom if he live will scarce be gentlemen—
Produce the grand sum of his sins, the articles
Collected from his life. (To Wolsey) I’ll startle you
Worse than the sacring-bell when the brown wench
Lay kissing in your arms, lord Cardinal.
