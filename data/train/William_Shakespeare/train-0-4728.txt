Exeunt
severally 5.1
Enter King Henry, Prince Harry, Lord John of Lancaster, the Earl of Westmorland, Sir Walter Blunt, and Sir John Oldcastle 
KING HENRY How bloodily the sun begins to peer
Above yon bulky hill! The day looks pale
At his distemp’rature. PRINCE HARRY The southern wind Doth play the trumpet to his purposes,
And by his hollow whistling in the leaves 5
Foretells a tempest and a blust’ring day.
