Enter the Duke of Cornwall, Regan, the Duke of Gloucester, and servants LEAR Good morrow to you both. CORNWALL Hail to your grace. Kent here set at liberty REGAN I am glad to see your highness. Regan, I think you are. I know what reason
I have to think so. If thou shouldst not be glad
I would divorce me from thy mother’s shrine,
Sepulchring an adultress. (To Kent) O, are you free?
Some other time for that. Exit Kent
Beloved Regan,
Thy sister’s naught. O, Regan, she hath tied
Sharp-toothed unkindness like a vulture here.
I can scarce speak to thee. Thou’lt not believe
With how depraved a quality-O, Regan!
