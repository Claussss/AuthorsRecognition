QUEEN GERTRUDE The lady protests too much, methinks. HAMLET O, but she’ll keep her word. KING CLAUDIUS Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in’t? HAMLET No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest. No offence i’th’ world. KING CLAUDIUS What do you call the play? HAMLET The Mousetrap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the image of a murder done in Vienna. Gonzago is the Duke’s name, his wife Baptista. You shall see anon. ’Tis a knavish piece of work; but what o’ that? Your majesty, and we that have free souls, it touches us not. Let the galled jade wince, our withers are unwrung.
