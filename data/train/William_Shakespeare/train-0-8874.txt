This was my lord’s best hope. Now all are fled
Save only the gods. Now his friends are dead.
Doors that were ne’er acquainted with their wards
Many a bounteous year must be employed
Now to guard sure their master;
And this is all a liberal course allows:
Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house.
