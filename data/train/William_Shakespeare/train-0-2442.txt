Thou seem’st not what thou art, a god, a king,
For kings like gods should govern everything. ‘How will thy shame be seeded in thine age
When thus thy vices bud before thy spring?
If in thy hope thou dar’st do such outrage,
What dar’st thou not when once thou art a king?
O be remembered, no outrageous thing
