Juliet rises My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
That God had lent us but this only child,
But now I see this one is one too much,
And that we have a curse in having her.
Out on her, hilding! NURSE God in heaven bless her! You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so. And why, my lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue,
Good Prudence. Smatter with your gossips, go!
