FIRST COUNTRYMAN I am sure To have my wife as jealous as a turkey—
But that’s all one. I’ll go through, let her mumble. SECOND COUNTRYMAN Clap her aboard tomorrow night and stow her,
And all’s made up again. THIRD COUNTRYMAN Ay, do but put A fescue in her fist and you shall see her
Take a new lesson out and be a good wench.
Do we all hold against the maying?
