Methinks I do. And how does your content Tender your own good fortune? You did supplant your brother Prospero. And look how well my garments sit upon me,
Much feater than before. My brother’s servants
Were then my fellows; now they are my men. SEBASTIAN But for your conscience. Ay, sir, where lies that? If ‘twere a kibe
’Twould put me to my slipper; but I feel not
This deity in my bosom. Twenty consciences
That stand ’twixt me and Milan, candied be they,
And melt ere they molest. Here lies your brother,
No better than the earth he lies upon
If he were that which now he’s like—that’s dead;
Whom I with this obedient steel, three inches of it,
Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,
To the perpetual wink for aye might put
This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who
Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest,
They’ll take suggestion as a cat laps milk;
They’ll tell the clock to any business that
We say befits the hour.
