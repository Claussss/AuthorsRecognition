EMILIA It’s the wind. DESDEMONA (sings) ‘I called my love false love, but what said he then?
Sing willow, willow, willow.
If I court more women, you’ll couch with more men.’
So, get thee gone. Good night. Mine eyes do itch. 56
Doth that bode weeping? EMILIA ’Tis neither here nor there. I have heard it said so. O, these men, these men!
Dost thou in conscience think—ten me, Emilia—
That there be women do abuse their husbands
In such gross kind?
