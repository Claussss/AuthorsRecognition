SECOND GENTLEMAN I honour him Even out of your report. But pray you tell me,
Is she sole child to th’ King? FIRST GENTLEMAN His only child. He had two sons—if this be worth your hearing,
Mark it: the eld‘st of them at three years old,
I’th’ swathing clothes the other, from their nursery
Were stol’n, and to this hour no guess in knowledge
Which way they went.
