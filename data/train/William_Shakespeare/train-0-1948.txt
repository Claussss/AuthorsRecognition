FIRST MURDERER What we will do, we do upon command. SECOND MURDERER And he that hath commanded is our king. Erroneous vassals, the great King of Kings
Hath in the table of his law commanded
That thou shalt do no murder. Will you then
Spurn at his edict, and fulfil a manâ€™s?
Take heed, for he holds vengeance in his hand
To hurl upon their heads that break his law.
