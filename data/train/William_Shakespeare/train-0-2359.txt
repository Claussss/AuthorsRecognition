The strongest body shall it make most weak,
Strike the wise dumb, and teach the fool to speak. â€˜It shall be sparing, and too full of riot,
Teaching decrepit age to tread the measures.
The staring ruffian shall it keep in quiet,
Pluck down the rich, enrich the poor with treasures; It shall be raging-mad, and silly-mild;
Make the young old, the old become a child.
