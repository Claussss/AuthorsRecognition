QUEEN ELEANOR Thou unadvised scold, I can produce
A will that bars the title of thy son. Ay, who doubts that? A will, a wicked will,
A woman’s will, a cankered grandam’s will! KING PHILIP Peace, lady; pause or be more temperate.
It ill beseems this presence to cry aim
To these ill-tun
Some trumpet summon hither to the walls
These men of Angers. Let us hear them speak
Whose title they admit, Arthur’s or John’s. 200
