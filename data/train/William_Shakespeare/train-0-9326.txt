’Twas merry when You wagered on your angling, when your diver
Did hang a salt fish on his hook, which he
With fervency drew up. That time—O times!— I laughed him out of patience, and that night
I laughed him into patience, and next morn,
Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed,
Then put my tires and mantles on him whilst
I wore his sword Philippan.
