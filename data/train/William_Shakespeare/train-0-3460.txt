Some honest Christian trust me with a gage. He takes anotherâ€™s gage and throws it down That Norfolk lies, here do I throw down this,
If he may be repealed, to try his honour. BOLINGBROKE These differences shall all rest under gage
Till Norfolk be repealed. Repealed he shall be,
And, though mine enemy, restored again
To all his lands and signories. When he is returned,
Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial.
