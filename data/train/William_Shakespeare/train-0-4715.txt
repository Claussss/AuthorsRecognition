Do me no slander, Douglas. By my life—
And I dare well maintain it with my life—
If well-respected honour bid me on, 10
I hold as little counsel with weak fear
As you, my lord, or any Scot that this day lives.
Let it be seen tomorrow in the battle
Which of us fears. DOUGLAS Yea, or tonight. 15 VERNON Content.
