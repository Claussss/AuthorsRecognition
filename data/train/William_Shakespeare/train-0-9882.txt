Sharp physic is the last. Aside
That gives heav’n countless eyes to view men’s acts,
Why cloud they not their sights perpetually
If this be true which makes me pale to read it? He gazes on the Daughter Fair glass of light, I loved you, and could still,
Were not this glorious casket stored with ill.
But I must tell you now my thoughts revolt,
For he’s no man on whom perfections wait
That, knowing sin within, will touch the gate.
You’re a fair viol, and your sense the strings
Who, fingered to make man his lawful music,
Would draw heav’n down and all the gods to hearken,
But, being played upon before your time,
Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.
Good sooth, I care not for you.
