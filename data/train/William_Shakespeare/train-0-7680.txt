Servingmen set stools Son Roper, you have given order for the banquet? I have, my lord, and everything is ready. Enter Lady More O welcome, wife. Give you direction
How women should be placed; you know it best.
For my Lord Mayor, his brethren, and the rest,
Let me alone. Men best can order men. I warrant ye, my lord, all shall be well.
Thereâ€™s one without that stays to speak with ye,
And bade me tell ye that he is a player.
