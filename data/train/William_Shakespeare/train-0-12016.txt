All his words are worthy. THESEUS (to Arcite) Sir, we are much indebted to your travel,
Nor shall you lose your wish.—Pirithous,
Dispose of this fair gentleman. Thanks, Theseus. (To Arcite) Whate’er you are, you’re mine, and I shall
give you
To a most noble service, to this lady,
This bright young virgin; pray observe her goodness.
You have honoured her fair birthday with your
virtues,
And as your due you’re hers. Kiss her fair hand, sir.
