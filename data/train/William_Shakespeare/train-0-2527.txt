To shun this blot she would not blot the letter
With words, till action might become them better. To see sad sights moves more than hear them told,
For then the eye interprets to the ear
The heavy motion that it doth behold,
When every part a part of woe doth bear.
â€™Tis but a part of sorrow that we hear;
