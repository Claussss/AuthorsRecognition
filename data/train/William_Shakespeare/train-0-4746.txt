And I do haunt thee in the battle thus
Because some tell me that thou art a king. BLUNT They tell thee true. The Lord of Stafford dear today hath bought
Thy likeness, for instead of thee, King Harry,
This sword hath ended him. So shall it thee,
Unless thou yield thee as my prisoner. I was not born a yielder, thou proud Scot,
And thou shalt find a king that will revenge
Lord Staffordâ€™s death.
