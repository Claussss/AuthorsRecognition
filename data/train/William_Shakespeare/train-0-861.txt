What, doth my lord of Suffolk comfort me?
Came he right now to sing a ravenâ€™s note
Whose dismal tune bereft my vital powers;
And thinks he that the chirping of a wren,
By crying comfort from a hollow breast
Can chase away the first-conceived sound?
Hide not thy poison with such sugared words. He begins to rise. Suffolk offers to assist him
