BIRON (aside) A fever in your blood—why then, incision
Would let her out in saucers—sweet misprision. Once more I’ll read the ode that I have writ. BIRON (aside) Once more I’ll mark how love can vary wit. Dumaine reads his sonnet ‘On a day—atack the day—
Love, whose month is ever May,
Spied a blossom passing fair
Playing in the wanton air.
Through the velvet leaves the wind
All unseen can passage find,
That the lover, sick to death,
Wished himself the heavens’ breath.
“Air”, quoth he, “thy cheeks may blow;
Air, would I might triumph so.
But, alack, my hand is sworn
Ne’er to pluck thee from thy thorn—
Vow, alack, for youth unmeet,
Youth so apt to pluck a sweet.
Do not call it sin in me
That I am forsworn for thee,
Thou for whom great Jove would swear
Juno but an Ethiop were,
And deny himself for Jove,
Turning mortal for thy love.”’
This will I send, and something else more plain,
That shall express my true love’s fasting pain.
O, would the King, Biron, and Longueville
Were lovers too! Ill to example ill
Would from my forehead wipe a perjured note,
For none offend where all alike do dote.
