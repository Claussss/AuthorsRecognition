CAPULET’S WIFE Find thou the means, and I’ll find such a man.
But now I’ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl. And joy comes well in such a needy time.
What are they, I beseech your ladyship? CAPULET’S WIFE Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy
That thou expect’st not, nor I looked not for.
