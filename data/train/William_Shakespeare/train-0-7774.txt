Let us entreat ye to go call together
The rest of your sad fellows—by the roll
You’re just seven score—and tell them what ye hear
A virtuous, honourable lord hath done
Even for the meanest follower that he had.
This writing found my lady in his study
This instant morning, wherein is set down
Each servant’s name, according to his place
And office in the house. On every man
He frankly hath bestown twenty nobles,
The best and worst together, all alike,
Which Master Catesby hereforth will pay ye.
