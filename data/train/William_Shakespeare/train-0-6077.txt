Nothing, Messala. MESSALA That methinks is strange. Why ask you? Hear you aught of her in yours? MESSALA No, my lord. Now as you are a Roman, tell me true. Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell;
For certain she is dead, and by strange manner. Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala.
With meditating that she must die once,
I have the patience to endure it now.
