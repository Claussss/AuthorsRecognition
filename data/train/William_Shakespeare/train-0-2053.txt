Come, come, dispatch: the Duke would be at dinner.
Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head. LORD HASTINGS O momentary grace of mortal men,
Which we more hunt for than the grace of God.
Who builds his hope in thâ€™air of your good looks
Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,
Ready with every nod to tumble down
Into the fatal bowels of the deep.
