How long within this wood intend you stay? Perchance till after Theseus’ wedding day.
If you will patiently dance in our round,
And see our moonlight revels, go with us.
If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts. Give me that boy and I will go with thee. Not for thy fairy kingdom.—Fairies, away.
We shall chide downright if I longer stay.
