Enter Helen with a letter, and the two Lords Dumaine SECOND LORD DUMAINE (to the Countess) Save you, good madam. Madam, my lord is gone, for ever gone. FIRST LORD DUMAINE Do not say so. COUNTESS (to Helen) Think upon patience.—Pray you, gentlemen,
I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief
That the first face of neither on the start
Can woman me unto’t. Where is my son, I pray you?
