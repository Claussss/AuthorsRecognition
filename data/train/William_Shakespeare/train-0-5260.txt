WESTMORLAND Whenever yet was your appeal denied?
Wherein have you been gall
What peer hath been suborned to grate on you,
That you should seal this lawless bloody book
Of forged rebellion with a seal divine? ARCHBISHOP OF YORK My brother general, the commonwealth
I make my quarrel in particular. WESTMORLAND
