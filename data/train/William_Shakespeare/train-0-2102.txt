Enter Lord Stanley Earl of Derby  How now, Lord Stanley? What’s the news? STANLEY Know, my loving lord, The Marquis Dorset, as I hear, is fled
To Richmond, in those parts beyond the seas
Where he abides. KING RICHARD Come hither, Catesby. (Aside to Catesby) Rumour it abroad
That Anne, my wife, is very grievous sick.
I will take order for her keeping close.
Enquire me out some mean-born gentleman,
Whom I will marry straight to Clarence’ daughter.
The boy is foolish, and I fear not him.
Look how thou dream’st. I say again, give out
That Anne, my queen, is sick, and like to die.
About it, for it stands me much upon
To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.
