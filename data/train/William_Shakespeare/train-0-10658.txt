No, good sir. He has his health, and ampler strength indeed
Than most have of his age. By my white beard, You offer him, if this be so, a wrong
Something unfilial. Reason my son
Should choose himself a wife, but as good reason
The father, all whose joy is nothing else
But fair posterity, should hold some counsel
In such a business.
