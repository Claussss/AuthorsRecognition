KING CLAUDIUS O, he is mad, Laertes. QUEEN GERTRUDE (to Laertes) For love of God, forbear him. HAMLET (to Laertes) ‘Swounds, show me what thou’lt do. Woot weep, woot fight, woot fast, woot tear thyself,
Woot drink up eisel, eat a crocodile?
I’ll do’t. Dost thou come here to whine,
To outface me with leaping in her grave?
Be buried quick with her, and so will I.
And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
Make Ossa like a wart. Nay, an thou’lt mouth,
I’ll rant as well as thou.
