O Nell, sweet Nell, if thou dost love thy lord,
Banish the canker of ambitious thoughts!
And may that hour when I imagine ill
Against my king and nephew, virtuous Henry,
Be my last breathing in this mortal world! !
My troublous dream this night doth make me sad. What dreamed my lord? Tell me and I’ll requite it
With sweet rehearsal of my morning’s dream.
