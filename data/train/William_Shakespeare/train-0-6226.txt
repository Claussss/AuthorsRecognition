 2.7
Enter Duke Senior and Lords dressed as outlaws 
DUKE SENIOR I think he be transformed into a beast,
For I can nowhere find him like a man. My lord, he is but even now gone hence.
Here was he merry, hearing of a song. DUKE SENIOR If he, compact of jars, grow musical
We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.
Go seek him. Tell him I would speak with him.
