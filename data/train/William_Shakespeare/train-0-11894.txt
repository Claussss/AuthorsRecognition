Cranmer takes his seat at the head of the Council table Now let me see the proudest, He that dares most, but wag his finger at thee.
By all that’s holy, he had better starve
Than but once think this place becomes thee not.
SURREY
May it please your grace— No, sir, it does not please me! I had thought I had had men of some understanding
And wisdom of my Council, but I find none.
Was it discretion, lords, to let this man,
This good man—few of you deserve that title—
This honest man, wait like a lousy footboy
At chamber door? And one as great as you are?
Why, what a shame was this! Did my commission
Bid ye so far forget yourselves? I gave ye
Power as he was a Councillor to try him,
Not as a groom. There’s some of ye, I see,
More out of malice than integrity,
Would try him to the utmost, had ye mean;
Which ye shall never have while I live.
