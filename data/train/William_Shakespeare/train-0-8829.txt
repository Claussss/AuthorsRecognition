Farewell, and come with better music. Exit APEMANTUS SO. Thou wilt not hear me now, thou shalt not then.
I’ll lock thy heaven from thee. O, that men’s ears
should be
To counsel deaf, but not to flattery! 2.1
Enter a Senator With bonds And late five thousand. To Varro and to Isidore
He owes nine thousand, besides my former sum,
Which makes it five-and-twenty. Still in motion
Of raging waste! It cannot hold, it will not.
If I want gold, steal but a beggar’s dog
And give it Timon, why, the dog coins gold.
If I would sell my horse and buy twenty more
Better than he, why, give my horse to Timon—
Ask nothing, give it him—it foals me straight,
And able horses. No porter at his gate,
But rather one that smiles and still invites
All that pass by. It cannot hold. No reason
Can sound his state in safety. Caphis ho!
Caphis, I say!
