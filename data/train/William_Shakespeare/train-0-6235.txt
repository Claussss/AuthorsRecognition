DUKE SENIOR True is it that we have seen better days,
And have with holy bell been knolled to church,
And sat at good menâ€™s feasts, and wiped our eyes
Of drops that sacred pity hath engendered.
And therefore sit you down in gentleness,
And take upon command what help we have
That to your wanting may be ministered.
