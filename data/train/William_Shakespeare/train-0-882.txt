Exeunt King Henry and Warwick with
attendants ho draw the curtains as they
leaveQueen Margaret and Suffolk remain QUEEN MARGARET rising Mischance and sorrow go along with you!
Heart’s discontent and sour affliction
Be playfellows to keep you company!
There’s two of you, the devil make a third,
And threefold vengeance tend upon your steps!
