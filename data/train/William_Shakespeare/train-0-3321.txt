LORD MARSHAL (to King Richard) The appellant in all duty greets your highness,
And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave. KING RICHARD We will descend and fold him in our arms. He descends from his seat and embraces Bolingbroke Cousin of Hereford, as thy cause is just,
So be thy fortune in this royal fight.
Farewell, my blood, which if today thou shed,
Lament we may, but not revenge thee dead.
