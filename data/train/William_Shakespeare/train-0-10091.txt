Where I am but a stranger. From the deck
You may discern the place. Where were you bred, And how achieved you these endowments which You make more rich to owe? MARINA If I should tell My history, it would seem like lies Disdained in the reporting. PERICLES Prithee speak. Falseness cannot come from thee, for thou look‘st
Modest as justice, and thou seem’st a palace
For the crowned truth to dwell in. I will believe thee,
And make my senses credit thy relation
To points that seem impossible. Thou show‘st
Like one I loved indeed. What were thy friends?
Didst thou not say, when I did push thee back—
Which was when I perceived thee—that thou cam’st
From good descending?
