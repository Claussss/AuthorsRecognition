Enter Menenius We stood to’t in good time. Is this Menenius? ‘Tis he, ’tis he. O, he is grown most kind of late.
Hail, sir. MENENIUS Hail to you both. Your Coriolanus is not much missed

And so would do were he more angry at it. All’s well, and might have been much better if
He could have temporized.
