He that thou knowest thine,
 Hamlet.’ Come, I will give you way for these your letters,
And do’t the speedier that you may direct me
To him from whom you brought them. Exeunt  4.7
Enter King Claudius and Laertes 
KING CLAUDIUS Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
And you must put me in your heart for friend,
Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
That he which hath your noble father slain
Pursued my life.
