FLAMINIUS As you have said, my lord. Exeunt Servants Lord Lucius and Lucullus? Hmh! Go you, sir, to the senators,
Of whom, even to the state’s best health, I have
Deserved this hearing. Bid ‘em send o’th’ instant
A thousand talents to me. FLAVIUS I have been bold, For that I knew it the most general way,
To them, to use your signet and your name;
But they do shake their heads, and I am here
No richer in return.
