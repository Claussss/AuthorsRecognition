Where mortal stars as bright as heaven’s beauties
With pure aspects did him peculiar duties. For he the night before in Tarquin’s tent
Unlocked the treasure of his happy state,
What priceless wealth the heavens had him lent
In the possession of his beauteous mate,
Reck’ning his fortune at such high-proud rate
