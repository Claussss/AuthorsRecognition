LORD HASTINGS Marry, that with no man here he is offendedâ€”
For were he, he had shown it in his looks. STANLEY I pray God he be not. Enter Richard and Buckingham RICHARD GLOUCESTER I pray you all, tell me what they deserve
That do conspire my death with devilish plots
Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevailed
Upon my body with their hellish charms?
