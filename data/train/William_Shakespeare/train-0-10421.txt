I’ll undertake’t. I think he’ll hear me. Yet to bite his lip
And ’hmh’ at good Cominius much unhearts me.
He was not taken well, he had not dined.
The veins unfilled, our blood is cold, and then
We pout upon the morning, are unapt
To give or to forgive; but when we have stuffed
These pipes and these conveyances of our blood
With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls
Than in our priest-like fasts. Therefore I’ll watch him
Till he be dieted to my request,
And then I’ll set upon him.
