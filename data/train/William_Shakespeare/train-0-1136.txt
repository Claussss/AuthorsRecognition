FIRST SOLDIER How will my mother for a father’s death
Take on with me, and ne’er be satisfied! SECOND SOLDIER How will my wife for slaughter of my son
Shed seas of tears, and ne’er be satisfied! How will the country for these woeful chances
Misthink the King, and not be satisfied! FIRST SOLDIER Was ever son so rued a father’s death?
