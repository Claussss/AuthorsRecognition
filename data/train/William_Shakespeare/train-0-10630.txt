Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,
And do not call them bastards. I’ll not put The dibble in earth to set one slip of them,
No more than, were I painted, I would wish
This youth should say ‘twere well, and only therefore
Desire to breed by me. Here’s flowers for you:
Hot lavender, mints, savory, marjoram,
The marigold, that goes to bed wi’th’ sun,
And with him rises, weeping. These are flowers
Of middle summer, and I think they are given
To men of middle age. You’re very welcome.
