Many that are not mad Have sure more lack of reason. What would you say? I am the sister of one Claudio,
Condemned upon the act of fornication
To lose his head, condemned by Angelo.
I, in probation of a sisterhood,
Was sent to by my brother, one Lucio
As then the messenger. That’s I, an’t like your grace.
