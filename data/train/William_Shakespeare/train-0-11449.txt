No, pray thee. (Aside) I must obey. His art is of such power
It would control my dam’s god Setebos,
And make a vassal of him. So, slave, hence! Exit Caliban Enter Ariel like a water-nymphplaying and
 singing, invisible to Ferdinand, who follows.
 Prospero and Miranda stand aside
Song Come unto these yellow sands, And then take hands;
Curtsied when you have and kissed—
The wild waves whist—
Foot it featly here and there,
And, sweet sprites, bear
The burden. Hark, hark.
