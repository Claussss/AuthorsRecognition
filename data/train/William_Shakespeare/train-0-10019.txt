LEONINE I will do’t; But yet she is a goodly creature. The fitter then the gods should have her. Enter Marina to the tombwith a basket of flowers Here she comes, weeping her only nurse’s death.
Thou art resolved. LEONINE I am resolved. No, I will rob Tellus of her weed
To strew thy grave with flow’rs. The yellows, blues,
The purple violets and marigolds
Shall as a carpet hang upon thy tomb
While summer days doth last. Ay me, poor maid,
Born in a tempest when my mother died,
This world to me is but a ceaseless storm
Whirring me from my friends.
