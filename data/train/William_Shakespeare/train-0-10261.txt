MENENIUS O me, the gods! 55 You must not speak of that, you must desire them
To think upon you. CORIOLANUS Think upon me? Hang ’em. I would they would forget me like the virtues
Which our divines lose by ’em. MENENIUS You’ll mar all. I’ll leave you. Pray you, speak to ’em, I pray you, 60
In wholesome manner.
