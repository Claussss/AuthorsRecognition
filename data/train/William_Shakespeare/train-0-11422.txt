O the heavens! Mark his condition and th’event, then tell me
If this might be a brother. I should sin To think but nobly of my grandmother.
Good wombs have borne bad sons. Now the condition. This King of Naples, being an enemy
To me inveterate, hearkens my brother’s suit;
Which was that he, in lieu o‘th’ premises
Of homage and I know not how much tribute,
Should presently extirpate me and mine
Out of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan,
With all the honours, on my brother. Whereon,
A treacherous army levied, one midnight
Fated to th’ purpose did Antonio open
The gates of Milan; and, i’th’ dead of darkness,
The ministers for th’ purpose hurried thence
Me and thy crying self.
