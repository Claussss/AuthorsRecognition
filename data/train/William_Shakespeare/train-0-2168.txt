KING RICHARD March on, march on, since we are up in arms,
If not to fight with foreign enemies,
Yet to beat down these rebels here at home. Enter Catesby My liege, the Duke of Buckingham is taken.
That is the best news. That the Earl of Richmond
Is with a mighty power landed at Milford
Is colder tidings, yet they must be told.
