QUEEN MARGARET Enough, sweet Suffolk, thou torment‘st thyself,
And these dread curses, like the sun ’gainst glass,
Or like an overcharged gun, recoil
And turn the force of them upon thyself. You bade me ban, and will you bid me leave?
Now by this ground that I am banished from,
Well could I curse away a winter’s night,
Though standing naked on a mountain top,
Where biting cold would never let grass grow,
And think it but a minute spent in sport.
