TIMON (aside) Must thou needs stand for a villain in thine own work? Wilt thou whip thine own faults in other men? Do so; I have gold for thee. POET (to Painter) Nay, let’s seek him. Then do we sin against our own estate When we may profit meet and come too late. PAINTER True. When the day serves, before black-cornered night,
Find what thou want’st by free and offered fight.
Come.
