To whom, my lord, shall I direct my style? KING EDWARD To one that stains the fair and sots the wise,
Whose body is an abstract or a brief,
Contains each general virtue in the world.
‘Better than beautiful’, thou must begin,
Devise for fair a fairer word than ‘fair’,
And every ornament that thou wouldst praise,
Fly it a pitch above the soar of praise.
For flattery fear thou not to be convicted,
For were thy admiration ten times more,
Ten times ten thousand more the worth exceeds
Of that thou art to praise thy praise’s worth.
Begin; I will to contemplate the while.
Forget not to set down how passionate,
How heart-sick and how full of languishment
Her beauty makes me.
