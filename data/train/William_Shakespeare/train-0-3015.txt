By men of Epidamnum he and I
And the twin Dromio all were taken up.
But, by and by, rude fishermen of Corinth
By force took Dromio and my son from them,
And me they left with those of Epidamnum.
What then became of them I cannot tell;
I, to this fortune that you see me in. DUKE (to Antipholus of Syracuse)
