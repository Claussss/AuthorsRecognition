 3.1
Enter King Claudius, Queen Gertrude, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and lords 
KING CLAUDIUS (to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern) And can you by no drift of circumstance
 Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
 Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
 With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
