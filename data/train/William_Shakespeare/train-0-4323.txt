GOBBO Pray you, sir, stand up. I am sure you are not Lancelot, my boy. LANCELOT Pray you, let’s have no more fooling about it, but give me your blessing. I am Lancelot, your boy that was, your son that is, your child that shall be. 81 GOBBO I cannot think you are my son. LANCELOT I know not what I shall think of that, but I am Lancelot the Jew’s man, and I am sure Margery your wife is my mother.
