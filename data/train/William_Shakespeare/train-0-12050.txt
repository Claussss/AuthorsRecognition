SCHOOLMASTER A tinker, damsel? JAILER’S DAUGHTER Or a conjurer—
 Raise me a devil now and let him play
Qui passa o’th’ bells and bones. SCHOOLMASTER Go, take her,
 And fluently persuade her to a peace.
Et opus exegi, quod nec Iovis ira, nec ignis—
Strike up, and lead her in. SECOND COUNTRYMAN Come, lass, let’s trip it.
