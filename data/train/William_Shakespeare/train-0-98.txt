(2 Henry VI), 3.2.73)
‘Sentence per line’ is the simplest kind of relationship between metre and grammar - and ‘clause per line’ is not very different. Such grammatically regular lines are often seen in the Sonnets, where they convey a measured rhythmical pace:
Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid
 My verse alone had all thy gentle grace,
 But now my gracious numbers are decayed,
 And my sick muse doth give another place.
