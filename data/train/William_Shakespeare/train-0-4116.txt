AUSTRIA Lady Constance, peace. War, war, no peace! Peace is to me a war.
O Limoges, O Austria, thou dost shame 40
That bloody spoil. Thou slave, thou wretch, thou
coward!
Thou little valiant, great in villainy;
Thou ever strong upon the stronger side;
Thou Fortune’s champion, that dost never fight
But when her humorous ladyship is by 45
To teach thee safety. Thou art perjured too,
And sooth‘st up greatness. What a fool art thou,
A ramping fool, to brag and stamp, and swear
Upon my party! Thou cold-blooded slave,
Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side, 50
Been sworn my soldier, bidding me depend
Upon thy stars, thy fortune, and thy strength?
And dost thou now fall over to my foes?
Thou wear a lion’s hide! Doff it, for shame,
And hang a calf’s-skin on those recreant limbs. 55
