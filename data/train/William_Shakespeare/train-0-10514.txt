My lord, go then, and with a countenance as clear
As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia
And with your queen. I am his cupbearer.
If from me he have wholesome beverage,
Account me not your servant. This is all. Do‘t, and thou hast the one half of my heart;
Do’t not, thou splitt’st thine own.
