COUNTESS OF SALISBURY My father on his blessing hath commanded— KING EDWARD That thou shalt yield to me. COUNTESS OF SALISBURY Ay, dear my liege, your due. KING EDWARD And that, my dearest love, can be no less
Than right for right, and render love for love. COUNTESS OF SALISBURY Than wrong for wrong, and endless hate for hate.
But sith I see your majesty so bent
That my unwillingness, my husband’s love,
Your high estate, nor no respect respected
Can be my help, but that your mightiness
Will overbear and awe these dear regards,
I bind my discontent to thy content,
And what I would not ill compel I will,
Provided that yourself remove those lets
That stand between your highness’ love and mine.
