Prove holy water on thee! He raises her Thy mother’s dead. I am sorry for’t, my lord. O, she was naught, and ’long of her it was
That we meet here so strangely. But her son
Is gone, we know not how nor where. Now fear is from me I’ll speak truth. Lord Cloten,
Upon my lady’s missing, came to me
With his sword drawn, foamed at the mouth, and
swore
If I discovered not which way she was gone
It was my instant death. By accident
I had a feigned letter of my master’s
Then in my pocket, which directed him
To seek her on the mountains near to Milford,
Where in a frenzy, in my master’s garments,
Which he enforced from me, away he posts
With unchaste purpose, and with oath to violate
My lady’s honour. What became of him
I further know not.
