PLAYER of WIT Twenty to one, ’tis so. I have a trick. My lord comes; stand aside. Enter More with attendants, with purse and mace In haste, to Council? What’s the business now
That all so late his highness sends for me?—
What seek’st thou, fellow? PLAYER of WIT Nay, nothing. Your lordship sent eight angels by your
man,
And I have lost two of them in the rushes.
