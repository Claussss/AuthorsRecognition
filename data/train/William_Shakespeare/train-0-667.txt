Confess, confess, hath he not hit you here? A has a little galled me, I confess,
And as the jest did glance away from me,
‘Tis ten to one it maimed you two outright. Now in good sadness, son Petruccio,

Let’s each one send unto his wife,
And he whose wife is most obedient
To come at first when he doth send for her
Shall win the wager which we will propose.
