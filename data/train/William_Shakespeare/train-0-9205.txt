Enter Seyton SEYTON What’s your gracious pleasure? What news more? All is confirmed, my lord, which was reported. I’ll fight till from my bones my flesh be hacked.
Give me my armour. SEYTON ’Tis not needed yet. MACBETH I’ll put it on. Send out more horses. Skirr the country round.
Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armour.
How does your patient, doctor?
