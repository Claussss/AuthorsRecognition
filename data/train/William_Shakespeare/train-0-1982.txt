Were never orphans had so dear a loss! DUCHESS OF YORK Was never mother had so dear a loss!
Alas, I am the mother of these griefs.
Their woes are parcelled; mine is general.
She for an Edward weeps, and so do I;
I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she.
These babes for Clarence weep, and so do I;
I for an Edward weep, so do not they.
Alas, you three on me, threefold distressed,
Pour all your tears. I am your sorrowâ€™s nurse,
And I will pamper it with lamentation.
