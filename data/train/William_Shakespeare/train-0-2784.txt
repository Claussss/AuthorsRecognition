KING OF FRANCE Go, and the next bough, soldier, that thou seest,
Disgrace it with his body presently,
Fore I do hold a tree in France too good
To be the gallows of an English thief. EARL OF SALISBURY (to the Dauphin) My lord of Normandy, I have your pass
And warrant for my safety through this land. Villiers procured it for thee, did he not?
