BASSANIO Let me choose, For as I am, I live upon the rack. 25 Upon the rack, Bassanio? Then confess
What treason there is mingled with your love. None but that ugly treason of mistrust
Which makes me fear th‘enjoying of my love.
There may as well be amity and life
’Tween snow and fire as treason and my love.
