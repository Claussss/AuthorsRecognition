Tybalt is gone and Romeo banished.
Romeo that killed him—he is banished. O God, did Romeo’s hand shed Tybalt’s blood? It did, it did, alas the day, it did. O serpent heart hid with a flow‘ring face!
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
Beautiful tyrant, fiend angelical!
Dove-feathered raven, wolvish-ravening lamb!
Despis
Just opposite to what thou justly seem’st—
A damn
O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell
When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?
Was ever book containing such vile matter
So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell
In such a gorgeous palace!
