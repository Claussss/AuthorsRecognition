Sir, my lord, I could do this, and that with no rash potion,
But with a ling’ring dram, that should not work
Maliciously, like poison. But I cannot
Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,
So sovereignly being honourable.
I have loved thee— Make that thy question, and go rot! Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,
To appoint myself in this vexation?
Sully the purity and whiteness of my sheets—
Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted
Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps-Give
scandal to the blood o’th’ prince, my son—
Who I do think is mine, and love as mine—
Without ripe moving to’t? Would I do this?
Could man so blench?
