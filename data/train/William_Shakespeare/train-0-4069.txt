From whom hast thou this great commission, France,
To draw my answer from thy articles? 111 KING PHILIP From that supernal judge that stirs good thoughts
In any breast of strong authority
To look into the blots and stains of right.
That judge hath made me guardian to this boy, 115
Under whose warrant I impeach thy wrong,
And by whose help I mean to chastise it.
