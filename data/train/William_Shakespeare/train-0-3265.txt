Exeunt the Worthies KING How fares your majesty ? Boyet, prepare. I will away tonight. Madam, not so, I do beseech you stay. Prepare, I say. I thank you, gracious lords,
For all your fair endeavours, and entreat,
Out of a new-sad soul, that you vouchsafe
In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide
The liberal opposition of our spirits.
If overboldly we have borne ourselves
In the converse of breath, your gentleness
Was guilty of it. Farewell, worthy lord.
A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue.
Excuse me so coming too short of thanks,
For my great suit so easily obtained.
