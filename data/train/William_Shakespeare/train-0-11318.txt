Than be so, Better to cease to be. Pray, sir, to th‘army.
I and my brother are not known; yourself
So out of thought, and thereto so o’ergrown,
Cannot be questioned. By this sun that shines, I’ll thither. What thing is’t that I never
Did see man die, scarce ever looked on blood
But that of coward hares, hot goats, and venison,
Never bestrid a horse save one that had
A rider like myself, who ne’er wore rowel
Nor iron on his heel! I am ashamed
To look upon the holy sun, to have
The benefit of his blest beams, remaining
So long a poor unknown.
