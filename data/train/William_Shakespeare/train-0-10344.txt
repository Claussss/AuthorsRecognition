Served well for Rome— What do you prate of service? I talk of that that know it. CORIOLANUS You? Is this the promise that you made your mother? Know, I pray you— CORIOLANUS I’ll know no further. Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,
Vagabond exile, flaying, pent to linger
But with a grain a day, I would not buy
Their mercy at the price of one fair word,
Nor check my courage for what they can give
To have’t with saying ‘Good morrow’.
