SECOND SENATOR What thou wilt, Thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile
Than hew to’t with thy sword. FIRST SENATOR Set but thy foot Against our rampired gates and they shall ope,
So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before
To say thou’lt enter friendly. SECOND SENATOR Throw thy glove, Or any token of thine honour else,
That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress,
And not as our confusion. All thy powers
Shall make their harbour in our town till we
Have sealed thy full desire.
