KING EDWARD Away, I say—t charge ye, bear her hence. QUEEN MARGARET So come to you and yours as to this Prince! Exit, guarded KING EDWARD Where’s Richard gone? GEORGE OF CLARENCE To London all in postaside
To make a bloody supper in the Tower. KING EDWARD He’s sudden if a thing comes in his head.
Now march we hence. Discharge the common sort
With pay and thanks, and let’s away to London,
And see our gentle Queen how well she fares.
By this I hope she hath a son for me. Exeunt
