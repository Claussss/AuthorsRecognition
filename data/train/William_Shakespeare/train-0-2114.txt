The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them;
But where, to say the truth, I do not know. KING RICHARD Come to me, Tyrrell, soon, at after-supper,
When thou shalt tell the process of their death.
Meantime, but think how I may do thee good,
And be inheritor of thy desire.
Farewell till then. I humbly take my leave.
