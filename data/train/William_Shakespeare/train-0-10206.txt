Take‘t, ’tis yours. What is’t? I sometime lay here in Corioles,
And at a poor man’s house. He used me kindly.
He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;
But then Aufidius was within my view,
And wrath o’erwhelmed my pity. I request you
To give my poor host freedom. O, well begged! Were he the butcher of my son he should
Be free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.
