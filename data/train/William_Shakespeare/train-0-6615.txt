He is dead and gone, lady,
He is dead and gone.
At his head a grass-green turf,
At his heels a stone. QUEEN GERTRUDE Nay, but Ophelia— OPHELIA Pray you, mark. White his shroud as the mountain snow— Enter King Claudius QUEEN GERTRUDE Alas, look here, my lord. OPHELIA (sings) Larded with sweet flowers,
Which bewept to the grave did—not—go
With true-love showers.
