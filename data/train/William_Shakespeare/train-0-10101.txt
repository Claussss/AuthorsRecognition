MARINA First, sir, I pray, What is your title? PERICLES I am Pericles Of Tyre. But tell me now my drowned queen’s name.
As in the rest thou hast been godlike perfect,
So prove but true in that, thou art my daughter,
The heir of kingdoms, and another life
To Pericles thy father. MARINA kneeling To be your daughter than to say my mother’s name?
Thaisa was my mother, who did end
The minute I began.
