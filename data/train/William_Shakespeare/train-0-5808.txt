Enter the Earl of Salisbury My sovereign lord, bestow yourself with speed.
The French are bravely in their battles set
And will with all expedience charge on us. All things are ready if our minds be so. Thou dost not wish more help from England, coz? Godâ€™s will, my liege, would you and I alone,
Without more help, could fight this royal battle.
