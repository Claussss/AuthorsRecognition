O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps,
And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,
And ’Tybalt’ calls, and then on Romeo cries,
And then down falls again. ROMEO As if that name Shot from the deadly level of a gun
Did murder her as that name’s cursed hand
Murdered her kinsman. O tell me, friar, tell me,
In what vile part of this anatomy
Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack
The hateful mansion.
