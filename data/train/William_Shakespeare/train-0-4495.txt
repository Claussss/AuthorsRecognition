Let not that doctor e’er come near my house.
Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,
And that which you did swear to keep for me,
I will become as liberal as you.
I’ll not deny him anything I have,
No, not my body nor my husband’s bed.
Know him I shall, I am well sure of it.
Lie not a night from home. Watch me like Argus.
If you do not, if I be left alone,
Now by mine honour, which is yet mine own,
I’ll have that doctor for my bedfellow.
