‘Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,
When men are unprepared, and look not for it. LORD HASTINGS O monstrous, monstrous! And so falls it out
With Rivers, Vaughan, Gray—and so ‘twill do
With some men else, that think themselves as safe
As thou and I, who as thou know’st are dear
To princely Richard and to Buckingham.
