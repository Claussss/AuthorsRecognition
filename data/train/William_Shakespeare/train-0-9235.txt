THE PERSONS OF THE PLAY The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra 1.1
Enter Demetrius and Philo Nay, but this dotage of our General’s
O‘erflows the measure. Those his goodly eyes,
That o’er the files and musters of the war
Have glowed like plated Mars, now bend, now turn
The office and devotion of their view
Upon a tawny front. His captain’s heart,
Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,
And is become the bellows and the fan
To cool a gipsy’s lust.
