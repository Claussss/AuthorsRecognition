SIR MICHAEL Why, my good lord, you need not fear; there is And Lord Mortimer. ARCHBISHOP No, Mortimer is not there. SIR MICHAEL But there is Mordake, Vernon, Lord Harry Percy;
And there is my lord of Worcester, and a head
Of gallant warriors, noble gentlemen. And so there is; but yet the King hath drawn
The special head of all the land togetherâ€”
The Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster,
The noble Westmorland, and warlike Blunt,
And many more corrivals, and dear men
Of estimation and command in arms.
