BASSANIO (to Shylock) For thy three thousand ducats here is six. If every ducat in six thousand ducats
Were in six parts, and every part a ducat,
I would not draw them. I would have my bond. How shalt thou hope for mercy, rend’ring none? What judgement shall I dread, doing no wrong?
You have among you many a purchased slave
Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,
You use in abject and in slavish parts
Because you bought them. Shall I say to you
‘Let them be free, marry them to your heirs.
Why sweat they under burdens? Let their beds
Be made as soft as yours, and let their palates
Be seasoned with such viands.’ You will answer
‘The slaves are ours.’ So do I answer you.
The pound of flesh which I demand of him
Is dearly bought. ’Tis mine, and I will have it.
If you deny me, fie upon your law:
There is no force in the decrees of Venice.
I stand for judgement. Answer: shall I have it?
