It gives a very echo to the seat
Where love is throned. Thou dost speak masterly.
My life upon’t, young though thou art thine eye
Hath stayed upon some favour that it loves.
Hath it not, boy? A little, by your favour. What kind of woman is’t? Of your complexion. She is not worth thee then. What years, i’faith?
