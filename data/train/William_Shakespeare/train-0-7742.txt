We not misdoubt your wisdom can discern
What best befits it; yet in love and zeal
We could entreat it might be otherwise. SHREWSBURY [to Rochester] No doubt your fatherhood will by yourself
Consider better of the present case,
And grow as great in favour as before. For that, as pleaseth God, in my restraint
From worldly causes I shall better see
Into myself than at proud liberty.
The Tower and I will privately confer
Of things wherein at freedom I may err.
But I am troublesome unto your honours,
And hold ye longer than becomes my duty.
Master Lieutenant, I am now your charge;
And, though you keep my body, yet my love
Waits on my king and you while Fisher lives.
