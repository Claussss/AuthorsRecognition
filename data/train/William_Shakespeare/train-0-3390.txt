NORTHUMBERLAND Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy? HARRY PERCY No, my good lord, for that is not forgot
Which neâ€™er I did remember. To my knowledge,
I never in my life did look on him. NORTHUMBERLAND Then learn to know him now. This is the Duke. HARRY PERCY My gracious lord, I tender you my service,
Such as it is, being tender, raw, and young,
Which elder days shall ripen and confirm
To more approved service and desert.
