RICHARD GLOUCESTER I was provoked by her sland’rous tongue,
That laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders. Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind,
That never dream’st on aught but butcheries.
Didst thou not kill this king? RICHARD GLOUCESTER I grant ye. Dost grant me, hedgehog? Then God grant me, too,
Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed.
O he was gentle, mild, and virtuous.
