These times of woe afford no times to woo.
Madam, good night. Commend me to your daughter. CAPULET’S WIFE I will, and know her mind early tomorrow.
Tonight she’s mewed up to her heaviness. Paris offers to go in, and Capulet calls him again Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
Of my child’s love. I think she will be ruled
In all respects by me. Nay, more, I doubt it not.
Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed.
Acquaint her here of my son Paris’ love,
And bid her-mark you me?—on Wednesday next—
But soft—what day is this?
