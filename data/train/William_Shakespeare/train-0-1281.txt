O, unbid spiteâ€”is sportful Edward come?
Where slept our scouts, or how are they seduced,
That we could hear no news of his repair? KING EDWARD Now, Warwick, wilt thou ope the city gates,
Speak gentle words, and humbly bend thy knee,
Call Edward king, and at his hands beg mercy?
And he shall pardon thee these outrages.
