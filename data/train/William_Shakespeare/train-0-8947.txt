APEMANTUS Myself. TIMON I understand thee: thou hadst some means to keep a dog. APEMANTUS What things in the world canst thou nearest compare to thy flatterers? TIMON Women nearest; but men, men are the things themselves. What wouldst thou do with the world, Apemantus, if it lay in thy power? APEMANTUS Give it the beasts, to be rid of the men.
