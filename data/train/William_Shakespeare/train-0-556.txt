See not your bride in these unreverent robes.
Go to my chamber, put on clothes of mine. Not I, believe me. Thus I’ll visit her. But thus, I trust, you will not marry her. Good sooth, even thus. Therefore ha’ done with
words.
To me she’s married, not unto my clothes.
Could I repair what she will wear in me
As I can change these poor accoutrements,
’Twere well for Kate and better for myself.
But what a fool am I to chat with you
When I should bid good morrow to my bride,
And seal the title with a lovely kiss!
