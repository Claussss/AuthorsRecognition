CARDINAL CAMPEIUS Most honoured madam, My lord of York, out of his noble nature,
Zeal, and obedience he still bore your grace,
Forgetting, like a good man, your late censure
Both of his truth and him—which was too far—
Offers, as I do, in a sign of peace,
His service and his counsel. QUEEN KATHERINE (aside)
