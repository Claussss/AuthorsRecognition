Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
Wherefore they do it. They could be content
To visit other places; and come down
With fearful bravery, thinking by this face
To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;
But â€™tis not so.
Enter a Messenger MESSENGER Prepare you, generals. The enemy comes on in gallant show.
Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,
And something to be done immediately.
