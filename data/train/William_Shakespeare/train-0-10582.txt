This your request Is altogether just. Therefore bring forth,
And in Apollo’s name, his oracle. [Exeunt certain Officers] The Emperor of Russia was my father.
O that he were alive, and here beholding
His daughter’s trial; that he did but see
The flatness of my misery—yet with eyes
Of pity, not revenge.
