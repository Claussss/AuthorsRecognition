He puts the crown on his head Lo where it sits,
Which God shall guard; and put the world’s whole

Into one giant arm, it shall not force
This lineal honour from me. This from thee
Will I to mine leave, as ’tis left to me. Exit Music ceases.The King awakes Warwick, Gloucester, Clarence! Enter the Earl of Warwick, and the Dukes of
Gloucester and Clarence
