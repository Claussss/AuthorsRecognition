Thy heaven is on earth; thine eyes and thoughts
Beat on a crown, the treasure of thy heart,
Pernicious Protector, dangerous peer,
That smooth’st it so with King and common weal! What, Cardinal? Is your priesthood grown
peremptory ?
Tantaene animis caelestibus irae?
Churchmen so hot? Good uncle, hide such malice
With some holiness—can you do it?
