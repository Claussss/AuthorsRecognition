The Duke’s in us, and we will hear you speak.
Look you speak justly. Boldly at least. (To Isabella and Mariana) But O, poor souls,
Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox,
Good night to your redress! Is the Duke gone?
Then is your cause gone too. The Duke’s unjust
Thus to retort your manifest appeal,
And put your trial in the villain’s mouth
Which here you come to accuse.
