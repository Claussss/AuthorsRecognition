A cannon shot within PRINCE PHILIPPE O, father, how this echoing cannon shot,
Like sweet harmony, digests my cates! KING OF FRANCE Now, boy, thou hear‘st what thund’ring terror ’tis
To buckle for a kingdom’s sovereignty.
The earth, with giddy trembling when it shakes,
Or when the exhalations of the air
Breaks in extremity of lightning flash,
Affrights not more than kings when they dispose
To show the rancour of their high-swoll’n hearts.
