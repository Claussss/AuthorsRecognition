‘Tis Caesar that you mean, is it not, Cassius? Let it be who it is; for Romans now
Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors.
But woe the while! Our fathers’ minds are dead,
And we are governed with our mothers’ spirits.
Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish. Indeed they say the senators tomorrow
Mean to establish Caesar as a king,
And he shall wear his crown by sea and land
In every place save here in Italy.
