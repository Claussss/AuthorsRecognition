AENEAS aside Troilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece
Than Cressid borne from Troy. PARIS aside There is no help.
The bitter disposition of the time
Will have it so.
Aloud AENEAS Good morrow all. And tell me, noble Diomedâ€”faith, tell me true,
Even in the soul of sound good-fellowship-
Who in your thoughts merits fair Helen most,
Myself or Menelaus?
