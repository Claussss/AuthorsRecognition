I thank you for your pains; But not away tomorrow! O, I must, madam. Therefore I shall beseech you, if you please
To greet your lord with writing, do’t tonight.
I have outstood my time, which is material
To th’ tender of our present. I will write. Send your trunk to me, it shall safe be kept,
And truly yielded you. You’re very welcome.
