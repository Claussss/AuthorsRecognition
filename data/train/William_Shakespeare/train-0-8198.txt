IAGO (aside) O, you are well tuned now, But I’ll set down the pegs that make this music,
As honest as I am. OTHELLO Come, let us to the castle. News, friends: our wars are done, the Turks are
drowned.
How does my old acquaintance of this isle?—
Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus,
I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet,
I prattle out of fashion, and I dote
In mine own comforts. I prithee, good Iago,
Go to the bay and disembark my coffers.
Bring thou the master to the citadel.
He is a good one, and his worthiness
Does challenge much respect. Come, Desdemona.—
Once more, well met at Cyprus!
