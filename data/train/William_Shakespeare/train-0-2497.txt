As from a mountain spring that feeds a dale
Shall gush pure streams to purge my impure tale.â€™ By this, lamenting Philomel had ended
The well-tuned warble of her nightly sorrow,
And solemn night with slow sad gait descended
To ugly hell, when lo, the blushing morrow
Lends light to all fair eyes that light will borrow.
