More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea,
Look on the tragic loading of this bed.
This is thy work. The object poisons sight.
Let it be hid. They close the bed-curtains  Graziano, keep the house,
And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,
For they succeed on you. (To Cassio) To you, Lord
Governor,
Remains the censure of this hellish villain.
The time, the place, the torture, O, enforce it!
Myself will straight aboard, and to the state
This heavy act with heavy heart relate.
