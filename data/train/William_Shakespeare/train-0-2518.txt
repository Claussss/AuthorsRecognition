For men have marble, women waxen minds,
And therefore are they formed as marble will.
The weak oppressed, thâ€™impression of strange kinds
Is formed in them by force, by fraud, or skill.
Then call them not the authors of their ill, No more than wax shall be accounted evil
Wherein is stamped the semblance of a devil.
