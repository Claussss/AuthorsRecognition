FALCONBRIDGE Shall then my fatherâ€™s will be of no force 130
To dispossess that child which is not his? Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,
Than was his will to get me, as I think. QUEEN ELEANOR Whether hadst thou rather be: a Falconbridge,
And like thy brother to enjoy thy land, 135
Or the reputed son of C
Lord of thy presence, and no land beside?
