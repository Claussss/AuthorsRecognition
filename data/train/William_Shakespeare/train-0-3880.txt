The wildest hath not such a heart as you.
Run when you will. The story shall be changed: 230
Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase.
The dove pursues the griffin, the mild hind
Makes speed to catch the tiger: bootless speed,
When cowardice pursues, and valour flies. I will not stay thy questions. Let me go; 235
Or if thou follow me, do not believe
But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.
