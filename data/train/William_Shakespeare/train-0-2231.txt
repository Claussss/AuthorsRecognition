Your honour’s in all duty, William Shakespeare 
Venus and Adonis 
Even as the sun with purple-coloured face
Had ta’en his last leave of the weeping morn,
Rose-cheeked Adonis hied him to the chase.
Hunting he loved, but love he laughed to scorn. Sick-thoughted Venus makes amain unto him,
And like a bold-faced suitor ’gins to woo him.
