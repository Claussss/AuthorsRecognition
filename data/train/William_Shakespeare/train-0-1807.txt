Art thou Revenge, and art thou sent to me
To be a torment to mine enemies? I am; therefore come down, and welcome me. Do me some service ere I come to thee.
Lo by thy side where Rape and Murder stands.
Now give some surance that thou art Revenge,
Stab them, or tear them on thy chariot wheels,
And then I’ll come and be thy wagoner,
And whirl along with thee about the globe,
Provide two proper palfreys, black as jet,
To hale thy vengeful wagon swift away
And find out murderers in their guilty caves.
And when thy car is loaden with their heads
I will dismount, and by thy wagon wheel
Trot like a servile footman all day long,
Even from Hyperion’s rising in the east
Until his very downfall in the sea;
And day by day I’ll do this heavy task,
So thou destroy Rapine and Murder there.
