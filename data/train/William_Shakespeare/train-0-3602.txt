CAPULET’S COUSIN ’Tis more, ’tis more. His son is elder, sir.
His son is thirty. CAPULET Will you tell me that? His son was but a ward two years ago. ROMEO (to a Servingman) What lady’s that which doth enrich the hand Of yonder knight? SERVINGMAN I know not, sir. O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
As a rich jewel in an Ethiope’s ear—
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear.
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
As yonder lady o’er her fellows shows.
The measure done, I’ll watch her place of stand,
And, touching hers, make bless
Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight,
For I ne’er saw true beauty till this night.
