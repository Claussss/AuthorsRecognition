THAISA (kneeling) Suppose his birth were base, when that his life
Shows that he is not so, yet he hath virtue,
The very ground of all nobility,
Enough to make him noble. I entreat you
To remember that I am in love,
The power of which love cannot be confined
By thâ€™ power of your will. Most royal father,
What with my pen I have in secret written
With my tongue now I openly confirm,
Which is I have no life but in his love,
Nor any being but in joying of his worth.
