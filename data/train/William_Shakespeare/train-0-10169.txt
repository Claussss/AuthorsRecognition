VIRGILIA Give me excuse, good madam, I will obey you in everything hereafter. VOLUMNIA (to Valeria) Let her alone, lady. As she is now she will but disease our better mirth. VALERIA In truth, I think she would. Fare you well, then. Come, good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy solemness out oâ€™ door and go along with us.
