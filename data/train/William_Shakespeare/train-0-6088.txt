GHOST Thy evil spirit, Brutus. BRUTUS Why com’st thou? To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi. Well; then I shall see thee again? GHOST Ay, at Philippi. Why, I will see thee at Philippi then. Exit Ghost
Now I have taken heart, thou vanishest.
Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.—
Boy, Lucius, Varrus, Claudio, sirs, awake!
Claudio!
