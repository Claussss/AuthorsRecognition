LUCIO Sir, I know him and I love him. 410 DUKE Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with dearer love. LUCIO Come, sir, I know what I know. DUKE I can hardly believe that, since you know not what you speak. But if ever the Duke return, as our prayers are he may, let me desire you to make your answer before him. If it be honest you have spoke, you have courage to maintain it. I am bound to call upon you; and I pray you, your name?
