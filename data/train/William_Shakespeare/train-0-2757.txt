I wonder, Villiers, thou shouldst importune me
For one that is our deadly enemy. Not for his sake, my gracious lord, so much
Am I become an earnest advocate
As that, thereby, my ransom will be quit. Thy ransom, man? Why needâ€™st thou talk of that?
Art thou not free? And are not all occasions
That happen for advantage of our foes
To be accepted of and stood upon?
