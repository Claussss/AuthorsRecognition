Is my lord angry? EMILIA He went hence but now, And certainly in strange unquietness. Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon
When it hath blown his ranks into the air,
And, like the devil, from his very arm
Puffed his own brother; and is he angry?
Something of moment then. I will go meet him.
There’s matter in’t indeed, if he be angry.
