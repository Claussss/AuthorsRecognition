He is given a key There, take it, Prince; and if my form lie there,
Then I am yours. Morocco opens the golden casket MOROCCO O hell! What have we here? A carrion death, within whose empty eye
There is a written scroll. I’ll read the writing. ‘All that glisters is not gold;
Often have you heard that told.
Many a man his life hath sold
But my outside to behold.
Gilded tombs do worms infold.
Had you been as wise as bold,
Young in limbs, in judgement old,
Your answer had not been enscrolled.
Fare you well; your suit is cold.’
Cold indeed, and labour lost.
Then farewell heat, and welcome frost.
