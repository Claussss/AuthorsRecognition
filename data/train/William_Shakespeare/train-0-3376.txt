Now God in heaven forbid! Ah madam, â€™tis too true! And, that is worse,
The Lord Northumberland, his son young Harry Percy,
The Lords of Ross, Beaumont, and Willoughby,
With all their powerful friends, are fled to him. Why have you not proclaimed Northumberland,
And all the rest, revolted faction-traitors?
