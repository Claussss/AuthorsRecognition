ROMEO (to Juliet) I take thee at thy word. Call me but love and Iâ€™ll be new baptized.
Henceforth I never will be Romeo. What man art thou that, thus bescreened in night,
So stumblest on my counsel? ROMEO By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am.
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself
Because it is an enemy to thee.
Had I it written, I would tear the word.
