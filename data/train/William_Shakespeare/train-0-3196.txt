Saint Denis to Saint Cupid! What are they
That charge their breath against us? Say, scout, say. Under the cool shade of a sycamore
I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour
When lo, to interrupt my purposed rest
Toward that shade I might behold addressed
The King and his companions. Warily
I stole into a neighbour thicket by
And overheard what you shall overhear:
That by and by disguised they will be here.
Their herald is a pretty knavish page
That well by heart hath conned his embassage.
Action and accent did they teach him there.
‘Thus must thou speak’, and ‘thus thy body bear’.
And ever and anon they made a doubt
Presence majestical would put him out,
‘For’, quoth the King, ‘an angel shalt thou see,
Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.’
The boy replied, ‘An angel is not evil.
I should have feared her had she been a devil.’
With that all laughed and clapped him on the
shoulder,
Making the bold wag by their praises bolder.
One rubbed his elbow thus, and fleered, and swore
A better speech was never spoke before.
Another with his finger and his thumb
Cried ‘Via, we will do’t, come what will come!’
The third he capered and cried ‘All goes welll’
The fourth turned on the toe and down he fell.
With that they all did tumble on the ground
With such a zealous laughter, so profound,
That in this spleen ridiculous appears,
To check their folly, passion’s solemn tears.
