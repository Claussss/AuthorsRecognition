LYSANDER She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes. DEMETRIUS And thus she means, videlicet: FLUTE (as Thisbe) Asleep, my love?
What, dead, my dove?
O Pyramus, arise.
Speak, speak. Quite dumb?
Dead, dead? A tomb
Must cover thy sweet eyes.
These lily lips,
This cherry nose,
These yellow cowslip cheeks
Are gone, are gone.
Lovers, make moan.
His eyes were green as leeks.
O sisters three,
Come, come to me
With hands as pale as milk.
Lay them in gore,
Since you have shore
With shears his thread of silk.
Tongue, not a word.
Come, trusty sword,
Come, blade, my breast imbrue.
She stabs herself
And farewell friends,
Thus Thisbe ends.
Adieu, adieu, adieu. She dies
