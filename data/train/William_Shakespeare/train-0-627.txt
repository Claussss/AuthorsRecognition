It likes me well. Cambio, hie you home
And bid Bianca make her ready straight,
And if you will, tell what hath happened—
Lucentio’s father is arrived in Padua—
And how she’s like to be Lucentio’s wife. ExitLucentio I pray the gods she may with all my heart. Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.
