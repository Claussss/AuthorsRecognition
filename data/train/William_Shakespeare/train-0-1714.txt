Enter Marcus with Lavinia Titus, prepare thy aged eyes to weep,
Or if not so, thy noble heart to break.
I bring consuming sorrow to thine age. Will it consume me? Let me see it then. This was thy daughter. Why, Marcus, so she is. LUCIUS (falling on his knees) Ay me, this object kills me. Faint-hearted boy, arise and look upon her.
