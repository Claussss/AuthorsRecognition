For this is from the present—how you take
The offers we have sent you. There’s the point. Which do not be entreated to, but weigh
What it is worth, embraced. And what may follow, To try a larger fortune? You have made me offer Of Sicily, Sardinia; and I must
Rid all the sea of pirates; then to send
Measures of wheat to Rome; this ’greed upon,
To part with unhacked edges, and bear back
Our targes undinted.
