DROMIO OF SYRACUSE (within the Phoenix) Nor today here you must not. Come again when you may. ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS What art thou that keep’st me out from the house I owe? DROMIO OF SYRACUSE (within the Phoenix) The porter for this time, sir, and my name is Dromio. DROMIO OF EPHESUS O villain, thou hast stol’n both mine office and my name.
The one ne’er got me credit, the other mickle blame.
If thou hadst been Dromio today in my place,
Thou wouldst have changed thy pate for an aim, or
thy name for an ass.
