Enter Chiron and Demetrius, braving Chiron, thy years wants wit, thy wits wants edge
And manners to intrude where I am graced
And may, for aught thou knowest, affected be. Demetrius, thou dost overween in all,
And so in this, to bear me down with braves.
‘Tis not the difference of a year or two
Makes me less gracious, or thee more fortunate.
I am as able and as fit as thou
To serve, and to deserve my mistress’ grace,
And that my sword upon thee shall approve,
And plead my passions for Lavinia’s love.
