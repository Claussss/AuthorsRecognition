BRUTUS Sheathe your dagger. Be angry when you will; it shall have scope.
Do what you will; dishonour shall be humour.
O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb
That carries anger as the flint bears fire,
Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark
And straight is cold again. CASSIUS Hath Cassius lived To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus
When grief and blood ill-tempered vexeth him?
