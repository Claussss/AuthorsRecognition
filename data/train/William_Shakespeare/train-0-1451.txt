GLOUCESTER As good?— Thou bastard of my grandfather. Ay, lordly sir; for what are you, I pray,
But one imperious in another’s throne? Am I not Protector, saucy priest? And am not I a prelate of the Church? Yes—as an outlaw in a castle keeps
And useth it to patronage his theft. Unreverent Gloucester.
