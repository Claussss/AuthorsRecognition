They want their porrage and their fat bull beeves.
Either they must be dieted like mules,
And have their provender tied to their mouths,
Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice. Letâ€™s raise the siege. Why live we idly here?
Talbot is taken, whom we wont to fear.
Remaineth none but mad-brained Salisbury,
And he may well in fretting spend his gall:
Nor men nor money hath he to make war.
