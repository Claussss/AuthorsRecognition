KING HENRY to Wolsey My life itself and the best heart of it
Thanks you for this great care. I stood i’th’ level
Of a full-charged confederacy, and give thanks
To you that choked it. Let be called before us
That gentleman of Buckingham’s. In person
I’ll hear him his confessions justify,
And point by point the treasons of his master
He shall again relate.
