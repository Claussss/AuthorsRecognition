SALISBURY Pardon me, madam, I may not go without you to the Kings. Thou mayst, thou shalt; I will not go with thee.
I will instruct my sorrows to be proud,
For grief is proud and makes his owner stoop. She sits upon the ground To me and to the state of my great grief 70
Let kings assemble, for my griefâ€™s so great
That no supporter but the huge firm earth
Can hold it up. Here I and sorrows sit;
Here is my throne; bid kings come bow to it.
