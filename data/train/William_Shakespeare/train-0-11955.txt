Though I know His ocean needs not my poor drops, yet they
Must yield their tribute there. (To Emilia) My precious
maid,
Those best affections that the heavens infuse
In their best-tempered pieces keep enthroned
In your dear heart. Thanks, sir. Remember me To our all-royal brother, for whose speed
The great Bellona I’ll solicit; and
Since in our terrene state petitions are not
Without gifts understood, I’ll offer to her
What I shall be advised she likes. Our hearts
Are in his army, in his tent.
