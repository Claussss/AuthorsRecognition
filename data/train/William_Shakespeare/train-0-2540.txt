For much imaginary work was there;
Conceit deceitful, so compact, so kind,
That for Achillesâ€™ image stood his spear
Gripped in an armed hand; himself behind
Was left unseen save to the eye of mind; A hand, a foot, a face, a leg, a head,
Stood for the whole to be imagined. And from the walls of strong-besieg
When their brave hope, bold Hector, marched to field,
Stood many Trojan mothers sharing joy
To see their youthful sons bright weapons wield;
And to their hope they such odd action yield
