‘I see what crosses my attempt will bring,
I know what thorns the growing rose defends;
I think the honey guarded with a sting;
All this beforehand counsel comprehends.
But will is deaf, and hears no heedful friends. Only he hath an eye to gaze on beauty,
And dotes on what he looks, ’gainst law or duty.
