ALL SERVANTS My lord, my lord. TIMON I will dispatch you severally, (To Servilius) You to Lord Lucius,
(To Flaminius) to Lord Lucullus you—
I hunted with his honour today—
(To Third Servant) You to Sempronius. Commend me
to their loves,
And I am proud, say, that my occasions have
Found time to use ’em toward a supply of money.
Let the request be fifty talents.
