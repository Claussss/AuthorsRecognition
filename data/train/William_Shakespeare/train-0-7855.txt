Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to th’ world?
Bear me to prison, where I am committed. I do it not in evil disposition,
But from Lord Angelo by special charge. Thus can the demigod Authority
Make us pay down for our offence, by weight,
The bonds of heaven. On whom it will, it will;
On whom it will not, so; yet still ’tis just.
