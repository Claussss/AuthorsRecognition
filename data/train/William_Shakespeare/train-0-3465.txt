NORTHUMBERLAND Well have you argued, sir, and for your pains
Of capital treason we arrest you here.
My lord of Westminster, be it your charge
To keep him safely till his day of trial.
May it please you, lords, to grant the Commonsâ€™ suit? BOLINGBROKE Fetch hither Richard, that in common view
He may surrender. So we shall proceed
Without suspicion.
