â€™Twere pity two such friends should be long foes. Julia and Proteus join hands Bear witness, heaven, I have my wish for ever. And I mine. Enter the Outlaws with the Duke and Thurio as captives A prize, a prize, a prize! Forbear, forbear, I say. It is my lord the Duke.
The Outlaws release the Duke and Thurio
(To the Duke) Your grace is welcome to a man
disgraced,
Banished Valentine.
