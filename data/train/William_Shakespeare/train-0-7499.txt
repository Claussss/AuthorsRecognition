When in the annals of all-wasting time
I see descriptions of the fairest wights,
And beauty making beautiful old rhyme
In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights;
Then in the blazon of sweet beauty’s best,
Of face, of hand, of lip, of eye, or brow,
I see their antique pen would have expressed
E’en such a beauty as you master now.
So all their praises were but prophecies
Of these our days, all you prefiguring,
And for they saw but with divining eyes
They had not skill enough your worth to sing;
For we which now behold these present days
Have eyes to wonder, but no tongues to praise.
