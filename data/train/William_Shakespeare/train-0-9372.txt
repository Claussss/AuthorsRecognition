I’ll try you on the shore. And shall, sir. Give’s your hand. You have my father’s house. But what, we are friends!
Come down into the boat. Exeunt all but Enobarbus and Menas Take heed you fall not, Menas. I’ll not on shore. No, to my cabin. These drums, these trumpets, flutes,
what! Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell
To these great fellows. Sound and be hanged, sound out!
