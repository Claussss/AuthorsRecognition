Exit Oswald Now, my lord,
This milky gentleness and course of yours,
Though I dislike not, yet under pardon
You’re much more ataxed for want of wisdom
Than praised for harmful mildness. How far your eyes may pierce I cannot tell.
Striving to better aught, we mar what’s well. GONORIL Nay, then— ALBANY Well, well, the event. Exeunt
