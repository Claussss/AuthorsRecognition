Hence, vile instrument, Thou shalt not damn my hand! Why, I must die, And if I do not by thy hand thou art
No servant of thy master’s. Against self-slaughter
There is a prohibition so divine
That cravens my weak hand. Come, here’s my heart.
Something’s afore’t. Soft, soft, we’ll no defence;
Obedient as the scabbard. What is here?
