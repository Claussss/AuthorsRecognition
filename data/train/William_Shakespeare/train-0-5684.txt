NIM I am not Barbason, you cannot conjure me. I have an humour to knock you indifferently well. If you grow foul with me, Pistol, I will scour you with my rapier, as I may, in fair terms. If you would walk off, I would prick your guts a little, in good terms, as I may, and thatâ€™s the humour of it. O braggart vile, and damned furious wight!
The grave doth gape and doting death is near.
Therefore ex-hale.
Pistol and Nim draw their swords
