OTHELLO I will deny thee nothing, Whereon I do beseech thee grant me this:
To leave me but a little to myself. Shall I deny you? No. Farewell, my lord. Farewell, my Desdemona. I’ll come to thee straight. Emilia, come. (To Othello) Be as your fancies teach you.
Whate’er you be, I am obedient.
Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia
