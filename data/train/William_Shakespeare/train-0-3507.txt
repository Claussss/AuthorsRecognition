KING HENRY (to lords) Withdraw yourselves, and leave us here alone. Exeunt all but King Henry and Aumerle What is the matter with our cousin now? For ever may my knees grow to the earth,
My tongue cleave to the roof within my mouth,
Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak. Intended or committed was this fault?
If on the first, how heinous eâ€™er it be,
To win thy after-love I pardon thee.
