PISTOL Trail’st thou the puissant pike? KING HARRY Even so. What are you? As good a gentleman as the Emperor. KING HARRY Then you are a better than the King. The King’s a bawcock and a heart-of-gold,
A lad of life, an imp of fame,
Of parents good, of fist most valiant.
I kiss his dirty shoe, and from heartstring
I love the lovely bully. What is thy name?
