What she says, I’ll confirm. We’ll fight it out. Assigned am I to be the English scourge.
This night the siege assuredly I’ll raise.
Expect Saint Martin’s summer, halcyon’s days,
Since I have entered into these wars.
Glory is like a circle in the water,
Which never ceaseth to enlarge itself
Till, by broad spreading, it disperse to naught.
With Henry’s death, the English circle ends.
Dispersed are the glories it included.
Now am I like that proud insulting ship
Which Caesar and his fortune bore at once.
