Virgiliacurtsies  What is that curtsy worth? Or those dove’s eyes
Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not
Of stronger earth than others. Volumnia bows My mother bows,
As if Olympus to a molehill should
In supplication nod; and my young boy
Hath an aspect of intercession which
Great nature cries ‘Deny not’.—Let the Volsces
Plough Rome and harrow Italy! I’ll never
Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand
As if a man were author of himself
And knew no other kin.
