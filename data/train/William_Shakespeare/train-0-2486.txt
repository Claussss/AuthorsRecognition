And let mild women to him lose their mildness,
Wilder to him than tigers in their wildness. 
Let him have time against himself to rave,
Let him have time of time’s help to despair,
Let him have time to live a loathed slave,
Let him have time a beggar’s orts to crave, And time to see one that by alms doth live
Disdain to him disdained scraps to give.
