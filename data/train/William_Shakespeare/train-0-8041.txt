LUCIO I was once before him for getting a wench with child. DUKE Did you such a thing? LUCIO Yes, marry, did I; but I was fain to forswear it. They would else have married me to the rotten medlar. DUKE Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well. LUCIO By my troth, I’ll go with thee to the lane’s end. If bawdy talk offend you, we’ll have very little of it. Nay, friar, I am a kind of burr; I shall stick.
