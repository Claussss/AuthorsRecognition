What wouldst thou have us do, Andronicus? Show me a murderer, I’ll deal with him. Show me a villain that hath done a rape,
And I am sent to be revenged on him. Show me a thousand that hath done thee wrong,
And I will be revenged on them all. TITUS (to Demetrius) Look round about the wicked streets of Rome,
And when thou find’st a man that’s like thyself,
Good Murder, stab him; he’s a murderer.
(To Chiron) Go thou with him, and when it is thy hap
To find another that is like to thee,
Good Rapine, stab him; he is a ravisher.
(To Tamora) Go thou with them, and in the Emperor’s
court
There is a queen attended by a Moor.
Well shalt thou know her by thine own proportion,
For up and down she doth resemble thee.
