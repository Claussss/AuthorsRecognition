So did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me.
Neither my place, nor aught I heard of business,
Hath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general
care
Take hold on me; for my particular grief
Is of so floodgate and o’erbearing nature
That it engluts and swallows other sorrows,
And it is still itself. Why, what’s the matter?
