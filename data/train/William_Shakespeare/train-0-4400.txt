No, we shall ne’er win at that sport and stake down. Enter Lorenzo, Jessica, and Salerio, a messenger from Venice  But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel!
What, and my old Venetian friend Salerio! Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither,
If that the youth of my new int’rest here
Have power to bid you welcome. (To Portia) By your
leave,
I bid my very friends and countrymen,
Sweet Portia, welcome.
