Profaned, dishonoured, and the third usurped. KING RICHARD QUEEN ELIZABETH By nothing, for this is no oath. Thy George, profaned, hath lost his holy honour;
 Thy garter, blemished, pawned his lordly virtue;
 Thy crown, usurped, disgraced his kingly glory.
 If something thou wouldst swear to be believed,
 Swear then by something that thou hast not wronged.
