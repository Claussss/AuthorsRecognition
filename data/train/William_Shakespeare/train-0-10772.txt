I am made of that self mettle as my sister,
And prize me at her worth. In my true heart
I find she names my very deed of love—
Only she comes too short, that I profess
Myself an enemy to all other joys
Which the most precious square of sense possesses,
And find I am alone felicitate
In your dear highness’ love.
