The heavens give safety to your purposes! Lead forth and bring you back in happiness! DUKE I thank you. Fare you well. I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave
To have free speech with you; and it concerns me
To look into the bottom of my place.
A power I have, but of what strength and nature
I am not yet instructed.
