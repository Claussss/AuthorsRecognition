My lord, my lord—you are a sectary,
That’s the plain truth. Your painted gloss discovers,
To men that understand you, words and weakness. CROMWELL (to Gardiner) My lord of Winchester, you’re a little,
By your good favour, too sharp. Men so noble,
However faulty, yet should find respect
For what they have been. ’Tis a cruelty
To load a falling man.
