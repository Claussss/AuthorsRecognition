WARWICK (to Salisbury) Father, the Duke of York hath told the truth;
Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown. Which now they hold by force and not by right;
For Richard, the first sonâ€™s heir, being dead,
The issue of the next son should have reigned. But William of Hatfield died without an heir. The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose line
I claim the crown, had issue Phillipe, a daughter,
Who married Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March;
Edmund had issue, Roger, Earl of March;
Roger had issue, Edmund, Anne and Eleanor.
