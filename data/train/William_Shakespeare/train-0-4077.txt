Bedlam, have done. CONSTANCE I have but this to say: That he is not only plagued for her sin,
But God hath made her sin and her the plague 185
On this removed issue, plagued for her
And with her plague; her sin his injury,
Her injury the beadle to her sin;
All punished in the person of this child,
And all for her. A plague upon her! 190
