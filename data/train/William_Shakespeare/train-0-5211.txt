PRINCE HARRY You, gentlewoman— DOLL TEARSHEET What says your grace? SIR JOHN His grace says that which his flesh rebels against. Peto knocks at door within MISTRESS QUICKLY Who knocks so loud at door? (Calls) Look to th’ door there, Francis. PRINCE HARRY Peto, how now, what news? The King your father is at Westminster;
And there are twenty weak and wearied posts
Come from the north; and as I came along
I met and overtook a dozen captains,
Bareheaded, sweating, knocking at the taverns,
And asking every one for Sir John Falstaff.
