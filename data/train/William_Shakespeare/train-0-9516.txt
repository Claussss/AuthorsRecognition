Noblest of men, woot die? Hast thou no care of me? Shall I abide
In this dull world, which in thy absence is
No better than a sty? Antony dies O see, my women, The crown o’th’ earth doth melt. My lord!
O, withered is the garland of the war.
The soldier’s pole is fall’n. Young boys and girls
Are level now with men. The odds is gone,
And there is nothing left remarkable
Beneath the visiting moon.
