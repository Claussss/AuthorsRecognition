And so have I addressed me. Fortune now
To my heart’s hope! Gold, silver, and base lead. He reads the leaden casket ‘Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.’
You shall look fairer ere I give or hazard.
What says the golden chest? Ha, let me see.
‘Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.’
‘What many men desire’—that ‘many’ may be meant
By the fool multitude, that choose by show,
Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach,
Which pries not to th’interior but, like the martlet,
Builds in the weather on the outward wall
Even in the force and road of casualty.
I will not choose what many men desire,
Because I will not jump with common spirits
And rank me with the barbarous multitudes.
Why then, to thee, thou silver treasure-house.
Tell me once more what title thou dost bear.
‘Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves’—
And well said too, for who shall go about
To cozen fortune, and be honourable
Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume
To wear an undeserved dignity.
O, that estates, degrees, and offices
Were not derived corruptly, and that clear honour
Were purchased by the merit of the wearer!
How many then should cover that stand bare,
How many be commanded that command?
How much low peasantry would then be gleaned
From the true seed of honour, and how much honour
Picked from the chaff and ruin of the times
To be new varnished? Well; but to my choice.
‘Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.’
I will assume desert. Give me a key for this,
And instantly unlock my fortunes here.
