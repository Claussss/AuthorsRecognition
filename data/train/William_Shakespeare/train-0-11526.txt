Do you love me? O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound,
And crown what I profess with kind event
If I speak true! If hollowly, invert
What best is boded me to mischief!
Beyond all limit of what else i’th’ world,
Do love, prize, honour you. MIRANDA (weeping) I am a fool To weep at what I am glad of.
