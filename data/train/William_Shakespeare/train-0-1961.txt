LORD HASTINGS So prosper I, as I swear perfect love. And I, as I love Hastings with my heart. KING EDWARD (to Elizabeth) Madam, yourself is not exempt from this,
Nor your son Dorset;—Buckingham, nor you.
You have been factious one against the other.
Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand—
And what you do, do it unfeignedly.
