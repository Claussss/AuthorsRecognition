Weâ€™ll show thee Io as she was a maid,
And how she was beguiled and surprised,
As lively painted as the deed was done. THIRD SERVINGMAN Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,
Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds,
And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,
So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.
