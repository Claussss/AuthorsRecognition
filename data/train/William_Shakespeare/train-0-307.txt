But she I mean is promised by her friends
Unto a youthful gentleman of worth,
And kept severely from resort of men,
That no man hath access by day to her. Why then I would resort to her by night. Ay, but the doors be locked and keys kept safe,
That no man hath recourse to her by night. What lets but one may enter at her window?
