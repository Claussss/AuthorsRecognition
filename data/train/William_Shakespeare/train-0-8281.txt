IAGO How now, my lord? What sense had I of her stol’n hours of lust?
I saw’t not, thought it not; it harmed not me.
I slept the next night well, fed well, was free and
merry.
I found not Cassio’s kisses on her lips.
He that is robbed, not wanting what is stol’n,
Let him not know’t and he’s not robbed at all.
