To know your answer, whether you’ll admit him. With all my heart. Some three or four of you
Go give him courteous conduct to this place. Exeunt three or four Meantime the court shall hear Bellario’s letter.
(Reads) ‘Your grace shall understand that at the receipt
of your letter I am very sick, but in the instant that
your messenger came, in loving visitation was with me
a young doctor of Rome; his name is Balthasar. I
acquainted him with the cause in controversy between
the Jew and Antonio, the merchant. We turned o’er
many books together. He is furnished with my opinion
which, bettered with his own learning—the greatness
whereof I cannot enough commend—comes with him
at my importunity to fill up your grace’s request in my
stead. I beseech you let his lack of years be no
impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation, for
I never knew so young a body with so old a head. I
leave him to your gracious acceptance, whose trial
shall better publish his commendation.’
