My noble masters, hear me speak. SECOND LORD (to Aufidius) Thou hast done a deed whereat Valour will weep. THIRD LORD to Aufidius and the Conspirators Tread not upon him, masters. All be quiet. Put up your swords. AUFIDIUS My lords, When you shall know—as in this rage
Provoked by him you cannot—the great danger
Which this man’s life did owe you, you’ll rejoice
That he is thus cut off. Please it your honours
To call me to your senate, I’ll deliver
Myself your loyal servant, or endure
Your heaviest censure.
