Stay, Humphrey Duke of Gloucester. Ere thou go,
Give up thy staff. Henry will to himself
Protector be; and God shall be my hope,
My stay, my guide, and lantern to my feet.
And go in peace, Humphrey, no less beloved
Than when thou wert Protector to thy King. QUEEN MARGARET I see no reason why a king of years
Should be to be protected like a child.
God and King Henry govern Englandâ€™s helm!
Give up your staff, sir, and the King his realm.
