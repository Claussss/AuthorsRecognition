SEBASTIAN (to Olivia) So comes it, lady, you have been mistook.
But nature to her bias drew in that.
You would have been contracted to a maid,
Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived.
You are betrothed both to a maid and man. ORSINO (to Olivia) Be not amazed. Right noble is his blood.
If this be so, as yet the glass seems true,
I shall have share in this most happy wreck.
(To Viola) Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times
Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.
