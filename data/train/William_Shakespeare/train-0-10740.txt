AUTOLYCUS I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born. CLOWN Ay, and have been so any time these four hours. OLD SHEPHERD And so have I, boy. CLOWN So you have; but I was a gentleman born before my father, for the Kingâ€™s son took me by the hand and called me brother; and then the two kings called my father brother; and then the Prince my brother and the Princess my sister called my father father; and so we wept; and there was the first gentleman-like tears that ever we shed.
