CORDELIA (aside) Then poor Cordelia— And yet not so, since I am sure my love’s
More richer than my tongue. LEAR (to Regan) To thee and thine hereditary ever
Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom, No less in space, validity, and pleasure
Than that confirmed on Gonoril. (To Cordelia) But
now our joy,
Although the last, not least in our dear love:
What can you say to win a third more opulent
Than your sisters?
