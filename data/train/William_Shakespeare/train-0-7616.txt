DOLL Before God, that’s as true as the gospel. GEORCE BETTS
LINCOLN Nay, this’ a sound fellow, I tell you. Let’s mark him. Let me set up before your thoughts, good friends,
One supposition, which if you will mark
You shall perceive how horrible a shape
Your innovation bears. First, ‘tis a sin
Which oft th’apostle did forewarn us of,
Urging obedience to authority;
And ‘twere no error if I told you all
You were in arms ’gainst God.
