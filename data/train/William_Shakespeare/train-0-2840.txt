I am invited, sir, to certain merchants
Of whom I hope to make much benefit.
I crave your pardon. Soon at five o’clock,
Please you, I’ll meet with you upon the mart,
And afterward consort you till bedtime.
My present business calls me from you now. ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Farewell till then. I will go lose myself,
And wander up and down to view the city.
