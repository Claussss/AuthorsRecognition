Gloucester, I live To thank thee for the love thou showed‘st the King,
And to revenge thine eyes.—Come hither, friend.
Tell me what more thou know’st. 4.3
Enter with a drummer and colours, Queen Cordelia, Gentlemen, and soldiers Alack, ’tis he! Why, he was met even now,
As mad as the vexed sea, singing aloud,
Crowned with rank fumitor and furrow-weeds,
With burdocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers,
Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow
In our sustaining corn. A century send forth.
Search every acre in the high-grown field,
And bring him to our eye.
