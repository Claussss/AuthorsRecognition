Her heavy anthem still concludes in woe,
And still the choir of echoes answer so. Her song was tedious, and outwore the night;
For loversâ€™ hours are long, though seeming short.
If pleased themselves, others, they think, delight
In such-like circumstance, with such-like sport. Their copious stories oftentimes begun
End without audience, and are never done.
