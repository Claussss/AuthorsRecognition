AJAX Shall I call you father? Ay, my good son. DIOMEDES Be ruled by him, Lord Ajax. ULYSSES (to Agamemnon) There is no tarrying here: the hart Achilles
Keeps thicket. Please it our great general
To call together all his state of war.
Fresh kings are come today to Troy; tomorrow
We must with all our main of power stand fast.
And hereâ€™s a lord, come knights from east to west
And cull their flower, Ajax shall cope the best.
