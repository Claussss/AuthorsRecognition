To whom in all this presence speaks your grace ? RICHARD GLOUCESTER To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.
When have I injured thee ? When done thee wrong?
Or thee? Or thee? Or any of your faction?
A plague upon you all! His royal grace—
Whom God preserve better than you would wish—
Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing while
But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.
