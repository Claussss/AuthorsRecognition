My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him:
That he dined not at home, but was locked out. But had he such a chain of thee, or no? He had, my lord, and when he ran in here
These people saw the chain about his neck. SECOND MERCHANT (to Antipholus) Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine
Heard you confess you had the chain of him,
After you first forswore it on the mart,
And thereupon I drew my sword on you;
And then you fled into this abbey here,
From whence I think you are come by miracle.
