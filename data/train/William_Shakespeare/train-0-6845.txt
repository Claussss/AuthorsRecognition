DUKE (giving money) There’s for thy pains. FESTE No pains, sir. I take pleasure in singing, sir. ORSINO I’ll pay thy pleasure then. FESTE Truly, sir, and pleasure will be paid, one time or another. ORSINO Give me now leave to leave thee. FESTE Now the melancholy god protect thee, and the tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta, for thy mind is a very opal. I would have men of such constancy put to sea, that their business might be everything, and their intent everywhere, for that’s it that always makes a good voyage of nothing. Farewell. Exit
