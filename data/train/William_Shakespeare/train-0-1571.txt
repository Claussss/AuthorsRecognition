SUFFOLK (aside) And yet a dispensation may be had. And yet I would that you would answer me. SUFFOLK (aside) I’ll win this Lady Margaret. For whom?

And peace established between these realms.

For though her father be the King of Naples,
Duke of Anjou and Maine, yet is he poor,
And our nobility will scorn the match.
