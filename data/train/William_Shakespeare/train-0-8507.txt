LEAR A bitter fool. FOOL Dost know the difference, my boy, between a bitter fool and a sweet fool? LEAR No, lad. Teach me. That lord that counselled thee To give away thy land,
Come, place him here by me;
Do thou for him stand.
The sweet and bitter fool
Will presently appear,
The one in motley here,
The other found out there.
