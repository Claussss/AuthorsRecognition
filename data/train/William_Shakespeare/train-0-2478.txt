Wrath, envy, treason, rape, and murder’s rages,
Thy heinous hours wait on them as their pages. ‘When truth and virtue have to do with thee
A thousand crosses keep them from thy aid.
They buy thy help, but sin ne’er gives a fee;
He gratis comes, and thou art well appaid
As well to hear as grant what he hath said.
