KING EDWARD Poor seely men, much wronged, and more distressed!
Go, Derby, go, and see they be relieved.
Command that victuals be appointed them,
And give to every one five crowns apiece. Exeunt the Earl of Derby and the six poor Frenchmen The lion scorns to touch the yielding prey,
And Edwardâ€™s sword must fresh itself in such
As wilful stubbornness hath made perverse.
