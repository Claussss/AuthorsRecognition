The warm effects which she in him finds missing
She seeks to kindle with continual kissing. But all in vain, good queen ! It will not be.
She hath assayed as much as may be proved;
Her pleading hath deserved a greater fee:
She’s Love; she loves; and yet she is not loved. ‘Fie, fie,’ he says, ‘you crush me. Let me go.
You have no reason to withhold me so.’
