Where shall we meet i’th’ morning? IAGO At my lodging. I’ll be with thee betimes. IAGO Go to, farewell— Do you hear, Roderigo? I’ll sell all my land. Thus do I ever make my fool my purse—
For I mine own gained knowledge should profane
If I would time expend with such a snipe
But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor,
And it is thought abroad that ’twixt my sheets
He has done my office. I know not if’t be true,
But I, for mere suspicion in that kind,
Will do as if for surety. He holds me well:
The better shall my purpose work on him.
Cassio’s a proper man. Let me see now,
To get his place, and to plume up my will
In double knavery—how, how? Let’s see.
After some time to abuse Othello’s ears
That he is too familiar with his wife;
He hath a person and a smooth dispose
To be suspected, framed to make women false.
The Moor is of a free and open nature,
That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,
And will as tenderly be led by th’ nose
As asses are.
I ha’t. It is ingendered. Hell and night
Must bring this monstrous birth to the world’s light.
