Thou wast the cause of that accursed effect. RICHARD GLOUCESTER Your beauty was the cause of that effectâ€”
Your beauty that did haunt me in my sleep
To undertake the death of all the world
So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom. If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,
These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.
