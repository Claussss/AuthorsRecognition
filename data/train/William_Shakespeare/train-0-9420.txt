’Tis easy to’t, and there I will attend
What further comes. To Caesar will I render My legions and my horse. Six kings already
Show me the way of yielding. I’ll yet follow The wounded chance of Antony, though my reason
Sits in the wind against me. Exeunt severally 
3.11
Enter Antony with Attendants Hark, the land bids me tread no more upon’t,
It is ashamed to bear me. Friends, come hither.
I am so lated in the world that I
Have lost my way for ever. I have a ship
Laden with gold. Take that; divide it, fly,
And make your peace with Caesar.
