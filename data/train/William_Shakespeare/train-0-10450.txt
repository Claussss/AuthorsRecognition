The ladies and Young Martius rise Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,
I’ll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,
Were you in my stead would you have heard
A mother less, or granted less, Aufidius? I was moved withal. I dare be sworn you were. And, sir, it is no little thing to make
Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,
What peace you’ll make, advise me. For my part,
I’ll not to Rome; I’ll back with you, and pray you
Stand to me in this cause.—O mother! Wife!
