I never heard a passion so confused,
So strange, outrageous, and so variable
As the dog Jew did utter in the streets.
‘My daughter! O, my ducats! O, my daughter!
Fled with a Christian! O, my Christian ducats I
Justice! The law! My ducats and my daughter!
A sealed bag, two seal
Of double ducats, stol’n from me by my daughter!
And jewels, two stones, two rich and precious stones,
Stol’n by my daughter! Justice! Find the girl!
She hath the stones upon her, and the ducats!’
