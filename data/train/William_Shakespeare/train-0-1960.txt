By heaven, my soul is purged from grudging hate,
And with my hand I seal my true heart’s love. He takes Hastings’ hand LORD HASTINGS So thrive I, as I truly swear the like. KING EDWARD Take heed you dally not before your king,
Lest he that is the supreme King of Kings
Confound your hidden falsehood, and award
Either of you to be the other’s end.
