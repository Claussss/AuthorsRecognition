Now blessing on thee! Rise. Thou art my child. Marina stands. He kisses her To attendants
Helicanus!
Not dead at Tarsus, as she should have been
By savage Cleon. She shall tell thee all,
When thou shalt kneel and justify in knowledge
She is thy very princess. Who is this? Sir, â€™tis the governor of Mytilene,
Who, hearing of your melancholy state,
Did come to see you.
