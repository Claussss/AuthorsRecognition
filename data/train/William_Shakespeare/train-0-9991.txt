PERICLES Now mild may be thy life, For a more blust‘rous birth had never babe;
Quiet and gentle thy conditions, for
Thou art the rudeliest welcome to this world
That e’er was prince’s child; happy what follows.
Thou hast as chiding a nativity
As fire, air, water, earth, and heav’n can make
To herald thee from th’ womb. Poor inch of nature,
Ev’n at the first thy loss is more than can
Thy partage quit with all thou canst find here.
Now the good gods throw their best eyes upon’t.
