FIRST GENTLEMAN O barbarous and bloody spectacle!
His body will I bear unto the King.
If he revenge it not, yet will his friends;
So will the Queen, that living held him dear.
Exit with Suffolkâ€™s head and body 4.2
Enter two Rebels  
FIRST REBEL Come and get thee a sword, though made of a lath; they have been up these two days.
