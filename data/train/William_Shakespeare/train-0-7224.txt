Good brother, come you hither,
And bring Aeneas and the Grecian with you. CRESSIDA My lord, will you be true? Who, I? Alas, it is my vice, my fault.
Whiles others fish with craft for great opinion,
I with great truth catch mere simplicity;
Whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns,
With truth and plainness I do wear mine bare.
