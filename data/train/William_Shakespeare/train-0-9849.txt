I must be patient. You that have turned off a first so noble wife
May justly diet me. I pray you yet—
Since you lack virtue I will lose a husband—
Send for your ring, I will return it home,
And give me mine again. BERTRAM I have it not. KING (to Diana) What ring was yours, I pray you? Sir, much like the same upon your finger.
