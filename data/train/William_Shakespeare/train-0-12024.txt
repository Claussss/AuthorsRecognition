Dear cousin Palamon— Cozener Arcite, give me language such
As thou hast showed me feat. Not finding in The circuit of my breast any gross stuff
To form me like your blazon holds me to
This gentleness of answer—’tis your passion
That thus mistakes, the which, to you being enemy,
Cannot to me be kind. Honour and honesty
I cherish and depend on, howsoe’er
You skip them in me, and with them, fair coz,
I’ll maintain my proceedings. Pray be pleased
To show in generous terms your griefs, since that
Your question’s with your equal, who professes
To clear his own way with the mind and sword
Of a true gentleman.
