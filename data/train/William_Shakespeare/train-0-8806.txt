O, Apemantus! You are welcome. APEMANTUS No, You shall not make me welcome.
I come to have thee thrust me out of doors. Fie, thou‘rt a churl. Ye’ve got a humour there
Does not become a man; ’tis much to blame.
They say, my lords, Ira furor brevis est,
But yon man is ever angry.
Go, let him have a table by himself,
For he does neither affect company
Nor is he fit for’t, indeed.
