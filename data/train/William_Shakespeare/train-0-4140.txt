Bell, book, and candle shall not drive me back
When gold and silver becks me to come on.
I leave your highness.â€”Grandam, I will pray,
If ever I remember to be holy,
For your fair safety. So I kiss your hand. QUEEN ELEANOR Farewell, gentle cousin. KING JOHN Coz, farewell. Exit the Bastard QUEEN ELEANOR
