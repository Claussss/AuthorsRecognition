TIMON When there is nothing living but thee, thou shalt be welcome. I had rather be a beggar’s dog than Apemantus. Thou art the cap of all the fools alive. Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon. A plague on thee! Thou art too bad to curse. All villains that do stand by thee are pure. There is no leprosy but what thou speak’st.
