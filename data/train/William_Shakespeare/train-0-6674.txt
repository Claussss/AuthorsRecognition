LAERTES Must there no more be done? PRIEST No more be done. We should profane the service of the dead
To sing sage requiem and such rest to her
As to peace-parted souls. LAERTES Lay her i’th’ earth, And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
May violets spring. I tell thee, churlish priest,
A minist’ring angel shall my sister be
When thou liest howling.
