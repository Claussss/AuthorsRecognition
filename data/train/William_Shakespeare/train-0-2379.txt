The sovereignty of either being so great
That oft they interchange each other’s seat. This silent war of lilies and of roses
Which Tarquin viewed in her fair face’s field
In their pure ranks his traitor eye encloses,
Where, lest between them both it should be killed,
The coward captive vanquished doth yield
