He saith she is immodest, blames her miss;
What follows more she murders with a kiss. Even as an empty eagle, sharp by fast,
Tires with her beak on feathers, flesh, and bone,
Shaking her wings, devouring all in haste
Till either gorge be stuffed or prey be gone, Even so she kissed his brow, his cheek, his chin,
And where she ends she doth anew begin.
