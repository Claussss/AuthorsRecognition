POET and PAINTER Name them, my lord, let’s know them. You that way and you this—but two in company-
Each man apart, all single and alone,

Hence; pack! Striking him
for gold, ye slaves.
Striking Painter
payment. Hence!
Striking Poet
Out, rascal dogs! Exeunt Poet and Painter one way,
Timon into his cave
