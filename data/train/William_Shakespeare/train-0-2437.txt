Yet, foul night-waking cat, he doth but dally
While in his holdfast foot the weak mouse panteth.
Her sad behaviour feeds his vulture folly,
A swallowing gulf that even in plenty wanteth.
His ear her prayers admits, but his heart granteth No penetrable entrance to her plaining.
Tears harden lust, though marble wear with raining.
