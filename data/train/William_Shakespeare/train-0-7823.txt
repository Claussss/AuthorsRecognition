FALKNER I humbly thank your honour. MORRIS And myself Shall rest most thankful for this gracious favour. Will’t please your honours now to keep your way?
I fear the lords are hindered by our stay. Exeunt Lords See, sir, what your ruffian tricks come to.
You think the eye of wisdom does not see
Into the brainsick follies of vain heads,
But with your swaggering you can bear’t away.
