LORD CHANCELLOR My most dread sovereign, may it like your grace
To let my tongue excuse all. What was purposed
Concerning his imprisonment was rather—
If there be faith in men—meant for his trial
And fair purgation to the world than malice,
I’m sure, in me. Well, well, my lords—respect him. Take him and use him well, he’s worthy of it.
I will say thus much for him—if a prince
May be beholden to a subject, I
Am for his love and service so to him.
Make me no more ado; but all embrace him.
Be friends, for shame, my lords. (To Cranmer) My lord
of Canterbury,
I have a suit which you must not deny me:
That is a fair young maid that yet wants baptism—
You must be godfather, and answer for her.
