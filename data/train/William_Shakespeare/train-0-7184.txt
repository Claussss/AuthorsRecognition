ACHILLES Shall Ajax fight with Hector? Ay, and perhaps receive much honour by him. I see my reputation is at stake.
My fame is shrewdly gored. O then beware:
Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves.
Omission to do what is necessary
Seals a commission to a blank of danger,
And danger like an ague subtly taints
Even then when we sit idly in the sun.
