COUNTESS OF SALISBURY Exeunt Scots
O happy comfort, welcome to our house!
The confident and boistâ€™rous boasting Scot,
That swore before my walls they would not back
For all the armed power of this land,
With faceless fear that ever turns his back,
Turned hence against the blasting north-east wind
Upon the bare report and name of arms!
