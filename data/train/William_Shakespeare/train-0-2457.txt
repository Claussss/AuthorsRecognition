To whose weak ruins muster troops of cares
To ask the spotted princess how she fares. She says her subjects with foul insurrection
Have battered down her consecrated wall,
And by their mortal fault brought in subjection
Her immortality, and made her thrall
To living death and pain perpetual, Which in her prescience she controlled still,
But her foresight could not forestall their will.
