LANCELOT The old proverb is very well parted between my master Shylock and you, sir: you have the grace of God, sir, and he hath enough. Thou speak‘st it well. (To Gobbo) Go, father, with thy son.
(To Lancelot) Take leave of thy old master and enquire
My lodging out. (To one of his men) Give him a livery
More guarded than his fellows’. See it done. 150
