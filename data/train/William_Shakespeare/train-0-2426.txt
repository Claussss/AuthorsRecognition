Who, angry that the eyes fly from their lights,
In darkness daunts them with more dreadful sights. His hand that yet remains upon her breast—
Rude ram, to batter such an ivory wall—
May feel her heart, poor citizen, distressed,
Wounding itself to death, rise up and fall,
Beating her bulk, that his hand shakes withal.
