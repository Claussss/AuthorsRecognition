Th’ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
Are joyfully returned. KING CLAUDIUS Thou still hast been the father of good news. Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,
Both to my God and to my gracious King.
And I do think—or else this brain of mine
Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
As it hath used to do—that I have found
The very cause of Hamlet’s lunacy.
