DOUGLAS (to Blunt’s body) A fool go with thy soul, whither it goes !
A borrowed title hast thou bought too dear.
Why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king? The king hath many marching in his coats. Now by my sword, I will kill all his coats. I’ll murder all his wardrobe, piece by piece,
Until I meet the King.
