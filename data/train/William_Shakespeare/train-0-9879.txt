Antiochus, I thank thee, who hath taught
My frail mortality to know itself,
And by those fearful objects to prepare
This body, like to them, to what I must;
For death remembered should be like a mirror
Who tells us life’s but breath, to trust it error.
I’ll make my will then, and, as sick men do,
Who know the world, see heav‘n, but feeling woe
Grip not at earthly joys as erst they did,
So I bequeath a happy peace to you
And all good men, as ev’ry prince should do;
My riches to the earth from whence they came,
(To the Daughter) But my unspotted fire of love to you.
(To Antiochus) Thus ready for the way of life or death,
I wait the sharpest blow, Antiochus.
