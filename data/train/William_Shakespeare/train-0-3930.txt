Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o’er. Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you. DEMETRIUS (awaking) O Helen, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!
To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?
Crystal is muddy. O, how ripe in show
Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!
That pure congealed white—high Taurus’ snow,
Fanned with the eastern wind—turns to a crow
When thou hold’st up thy hand. O, let me kiss
This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!
