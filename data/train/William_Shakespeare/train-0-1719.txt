Sweet father, cease your tears, for at your grief
See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps. Patience, dear niece. Good Titus, dry thine eyes. Ah, Marcus, Marcus, brother, well I wot
Thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine,
For thou, poor man, hast drowned it with thine own. Ah, my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks.
