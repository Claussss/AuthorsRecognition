I am glad your grace has made that right use of it. CARDINAL WOLSEY I hope I have. I am able now, methinks,
Out of a fortitude of soul I feel,
To endure more miseries and greater far
Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer.
What news abroad? The heaviest and the worst Is your displeasure with the King.
