Your children shall be kings. You shall be king. And Thane of Cawdor too. Went it not so? To th’ self-same tune and words. Who’s here? Enter Ross and Angus The King hath happily received, Macbeth,
The news of thy success, and when he reads
Thy personal venture in the rebels’ sight
His wonders and his praises do contend
Which should be thine or his; silenced with that,
In viewing o‘er the rest o’th’ self-same day
He finds thee in the stout Norwegian ranks,
Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,
Strange images of death. As thick as hail
Came post with post, and every one did bear
Thy praises in his kingdom’s great defence,
And poured them down before him.
