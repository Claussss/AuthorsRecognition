DUKE (to Angelo) Know you this woman? LUCIO Carnally, she says. DUKE Sirrah, no more! LUCIO Enough, my lord. My lord, I must confess I know this woman;
And five years since there was some speech of
marriage
Betwixt myself and her, which was broke off,
Partly for that her promised proportions
Came short of composition, but in chief
For that her reputation was disvalued
In levity; since which time of five years
I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,
Upon my faith and honour.
