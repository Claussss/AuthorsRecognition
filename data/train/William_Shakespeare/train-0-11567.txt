A contract of true love to celebrate,
And some donation freely to estate
On the blest lovers. Tell me, heavenly bow, If Venus or her son, as thou dost know,
Do now attend the Queen. Since they did plot
The means that dusky Dis my daughter got,
Her and her blind boyâ€™s scandalled company
I have forsworn.
