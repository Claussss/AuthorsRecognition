DUC DE LORRAINE To lay aside unnecessary soothing,
And not to spend the time in circumstance,
’Tis bruited for a certainty, my lord,
That he’s exceeding strongly fortified.
His subjects flock as willingly to war
As if unto a triumph they were led. England was wont to harbour malcontents,
Bloodthirsty and seditious Catilines,
Spendthrifts, and such as gape for nothing else
But change and alteration of the state.
And is it possible
That they are now so loyal in themselves?
