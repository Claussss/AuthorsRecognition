LOUIS THE DAUPHIN What he hath won, that hath he fortified. 10
So hot a speed, with such advice disposed,
Such temperate order in so fierce a cause,
Doth want example. Who hath read or heard
Of any kindred action like to this? KING PHILIP Well could I bear that England had this praise, 15
So we could find some pattern of our shame.
