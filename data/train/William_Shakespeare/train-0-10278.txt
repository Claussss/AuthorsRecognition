BRUTUS (to the Citizens) Lay A fault on us your tribunes, that we laboured
No impediment between, but that you must
Cast your election on him. SICINIUS (to the Citizens) Say you chose him More after our commandment than as guided
By your own true affections, and that your minds,
Preoccupied with what you rather must do
Than what you should, made you against the grain
To voice him consul. Lay the fault on us.
