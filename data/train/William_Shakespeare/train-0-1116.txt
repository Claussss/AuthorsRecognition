Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak. QUEEN MARGARET Defy them, then, or else hold close thy lips. I prithee give no limits to my tongue—
I am a king, and privileged to speak. My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here
Cannot be cured by words—therefore be still. Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword.
By him that made us all, I am resolved
That Clifford’s manhood lies upon his tongue.
