Rise, prithee, rise. Sit down. Thou art no flatterer,
I thank thee for it, and the heav‘ns forbid
That kings should let their ears hear their faults hid.
Fit counsellor and servant for a prince,
Who by thy wisdom mak’st a prince thy servant,
What wouldst thou have me do? To bear with patience Such griefs as you do lay upon yourself.
