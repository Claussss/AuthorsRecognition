CARDINAL WOLSEY I do profess That for your highness’ good I ever laboured
More than mine own; that am, have, and will be—
Though all the world should crack their duty to you,
And throw it from their soul, though perils did
Abound, as thick as thought could make ’em, and
Appear in forms more horrid—yet, my duty,
As doth a rock against the chiding flood,
Should the approach of this wild river break,
And stand unshaken yours.
