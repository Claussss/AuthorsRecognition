I know it pleaseth neither of us well. RICHARD GLOUCESTER Well, your imprisonment shall not be long.
I will deliver you or lie for you.
Meantime, have patience. I must perforce. Farewell. Exeunt Clarence, Brackenbury, and guard, to the Tower RICHARD GLOUCESTER Go tread the path that thou shalt neâ€™er return.
Simple plain Clarence, I do love thee so
That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,
If heaven will take the present at our hands.
But who comes here? The new-delivered Hastings?
