Iâ€™ll blast his harvest, an your head were laid;
For yet I am not looked on in the world.
This shoulder was ordained so thick to heave;
And heave it shall some weight or break my back.
Work thou the way, and thou shalt execute. KING EDWARD Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen;
And kiss your princely nephew, brothers, both.
