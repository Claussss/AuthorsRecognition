Enter Queen Be brief, I pray you. If the King come, I shall incur I know not
How much of his displeasure. (Aside) Yet Iâ€™ll move him
To walk this way. I never do him wrong
But he does buy my injuries, to be friends,
Pays dear for my offences. Exit Should we be taking leave As long a term as yet we have to live,
The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu.
