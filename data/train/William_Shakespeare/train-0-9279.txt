LEPIDUS ’Tis pity of him. CAESAR Let his shames quickly Drive him to Rome. ‘Tis time we twain
Did show ourselves i’th’ field; and to that end
Assemble we immediate council. Pompey
Thrives in our idleness. Tomorrow, Caesar, I shall be furnished to inform you rightly
Both what by sea and land I can be able
To front this present time.
