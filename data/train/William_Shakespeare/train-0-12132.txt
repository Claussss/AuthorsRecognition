Here music is heard, doves are seen to flutter. They fall again upon their faces, then on their knees O thou that from eleven to ninety reignâ€™st
In mortal bosoms, whose chase is this world
And we in herds thy game, I give thee thanks
For this fair token, which, being laid unto
Mine innocent true heart, arms in assurance
My body to this business. (To his Knights) Let us rise
And bow before the goddess.
