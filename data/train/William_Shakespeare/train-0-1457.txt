SECOND SERVINGMAN Do what ye dare, we are as resolute. Skirmish again You of my household, leave this peevish broil,
And set this unaccustomed fight aside. THIRD SERVINGMAN My lord, we know your grace to be a man
Just and upright and, for your royal birth,
Inferior to none but to his majesty;
And ere that we will suffer such a prince,
So kind a father of the commonweal,
To be disgraced by an inkhorn mate,
We and our wives and children all will fight
And have our bodies slaughtered by thy foes.
