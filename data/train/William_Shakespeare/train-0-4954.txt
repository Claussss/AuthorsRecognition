ANNE Maybe he tells you true. No, heaven so speed me in my time to come!
Albeit I will confess thy father’s wealth
Was the first motive that I wooed thee, Anne,
Yet, wooing thee, I found thee of more value
Than stamps in gold or sums in seal
And ’tis the very riches of thyself
That now I aim at. ANNE Gentle Master Fenton,
