What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture? That young swain that you saw here but erewhile,
That little cares for buying anything. I pray thee, if it stand with honesty,
Buy thou the cottage, pasture, and the flock,
And thou shalt have to pay for it of us. And we will mend thy wages. I like this place,
And willingly could waste my time in it.
