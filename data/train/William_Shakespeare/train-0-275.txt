Too low a mistress for so high a servant. Not so, sweet lady, but too mean a servant
To have a look of such a worthy mistress. Leave off discourse of disability.
Sweet lady, entertain him for your servant. My duty will I boast of, nothing else. And duty never yet did want his meed.
Servant, you are welcome to a worthless mistress.
