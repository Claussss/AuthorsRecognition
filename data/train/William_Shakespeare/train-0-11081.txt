SECOND GENTLEMAN I do well believe you. Enter the Queen, Posthumus, and Innogen FIRST GENTLEMAN We must forbear. Here comes the gentleman,
The Queen and Princess. Exeunt the two Gentlemen No, be assured you shall not find me, daughter,
After the slander of most stepmothers,
Evil-eyed unto you. You’re my prisoner, but
Your jailer shall deliver you the keys
That lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,
So soon as I can win th‘offended King
I will be known your advocate. Marry, yet
The fire of rage is in him, and ’twere good
You leaned unto his sentence with what patience
Your wisdom may inform you.
