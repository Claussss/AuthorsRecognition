The tune of Innogen. Lady, the gods throw stones of sulphur on me if
That box I gave you was not thought by me
A precious thing. I had it from the Queen. New matter still. It poisoned me. I left out one thing which the Queen confessed
(To Pisanio) Which must approve thee honest. ’If Pisanio Have‘, said she, ‘given his mistress that confection
Which I gave him for cordial, she is served
As I would serve a rat.’
