Speak, gentle sister, who hath martyred thee. O, that delightful engine of her thoughts,
That blabbed them with such pleasing eloquence,
Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage
Where, like a sweet melodious bird, it sung
Sweet varied notes, enchanting every ear. O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?
