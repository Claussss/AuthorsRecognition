ARCHBISHOP OF YORK To you, my noble lord of Westmorland! WESTMORLAND (drinking) I pledge your grace. An if you knew what pains
I have bestowed to breed this present peace,
You would drink freely; but my love to ye
Shall show itself more openly hereafter. ARCHBISHOP OF YORK I do not doubt you. WESTMORLAND I am glad of it.
