BULLCALF O Lord, good my lord captain! SIR JOHN What, dost thou roar before thou’rt pricked? BULLCALF O Lord, sir, I am a diseased man. SIR JOHN What disease hast thou? BULLCALF A whoreson cold, sir; a cough, sir, which I caught with ringing in the King’s affairs upon his coronation day, sir. 180 SIR JOHN Come, thou shalt go to the wars in a gown. We will have away thy cold, and I will take such order that thy friends shall ring for thee.
