TITUS (aside) I knew them all, though they supposed me mad,
And will o’erreach them in their own devices—
A pair of cursed hell-hounds and their dam. Madam, depart at pleasure. Leave us here. Farewell, Andronicus. Revenge now goes
To lay a complot to betray thy foes. I know thou dost, and sweet Revenge, farewell.
