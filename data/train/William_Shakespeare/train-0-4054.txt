 A foot of honour better than I was,
But many a many foot of land the worse.
Well, now can I make any Joan a lady.
‘Good e’en, Sir Richard‘—’God-a-mercy fellow’;
And if his name be George I’ll call him Peter,
For new-made honour doth forget men’s names;
’Tis too respective and too sociable
For your conversion. Now your traveller,
He and his toothpick at my worship’s mess; 190
And when my knightly stomach is sufficed,
Why then I suck my teeth and catechize
My picked man of countries. ‘My dear sir,’
Thus leaning on mine elbow I begin,
‘I shall beseech you—’. That is Question now; 195
And then comes Answer like an Absey book.
‘O sir,’ says Answer, ‘at your best command,
At your employment, at your service, sir.’
‘No sir,’ says Question, ‘I, sweet sir, at yours.’
And so, ere Answer knows what Question would,
Saving in dialogue of compliment,
And talking of the Alps and Apennines,
The Pyrenean and the River Po,
It draws toward supper in conclusion so.
But this is worshipful society, 205
And fits the mounting spirit like myself;
For he is but a bastard to the time
That doth not smack of observation;
And so am I—whether I smack or no,
And not alone in habit and device, 210
Exterior form, outward accoutrement,
But from the inward motion—to deliver
Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age’s tooth;
Which, though I will not practise to deceive,
Yet to avoid deceit I mean to learn; 215
For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.
