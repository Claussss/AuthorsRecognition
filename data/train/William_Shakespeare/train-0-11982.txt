ARCITE I would hear you still. Ye shall. Is there record of any two that loved
Better than we do, Arcite? ARCITE Sure there cannot. I do not think it possible our friendship
Should ever leave us. ARCITE Till our deaths it cannot, Enter Emilia and her Woman below. Palamon sees Emilia and is silent And after death our spirits shall be led
To those that love eternally. Speak on, sir.
