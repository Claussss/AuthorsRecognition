Why, is it lawful for a man to kill,
And not to break a promise with his foe? To kill, my lord, when war is once proclaimed,
So that our quarrel be for wrongs received,
No doubt is lawfully permitted us.
But in an oath, we must be well advised
How we do swear, and when we once have sworn,
Not to infringe it, though we die therefor.
Therefore, my lord, as willing I return
As if I were to fly to paradise.
