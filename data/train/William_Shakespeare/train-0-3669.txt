I am a-weary. Give me leave a while.
Fie, how my bones ache. What a jaunce have I! I would thou hadst my bones and I thy news.
Nay, come, I pray thee speak, good, good Nurse, speak. Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay a while?
Do you not see that I am out of breath? How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath
To say to me that thou art out of breath?
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that.
Say either, and I’ll stay the circumstance.
Let me be satisfied: is’t good or bad?
