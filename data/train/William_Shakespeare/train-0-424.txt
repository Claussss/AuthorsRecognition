Fear not, my lord, we can contain ourselves
Were he the veriest antic in the world. LORD (to a Servingman) Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery
And give them friendly welcome every one.
Let them want nothing that my house affords. Exit one with the Players (To a Servingman) Sirrah, go you to Barthol‘mew, my
page,
And see him dressed in all suits like a lady.
That done, conduct him to the drunkard’s chamber
And call him ‘madam’, do him obeisance.
Tell him from me, as he will win my love,
He bear himself with honourable action
Such as he hath observed in noble ladies
Unto their lords by them accomplished.
Such duty to the drunkard let him do
With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,
And say ‘What is’t your honour will command
Wherein your lady and your humble wife
May show her duty and make known her love?’
And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,
And with declining head into his bosom
Bid him shed tears, as being overjoyed
To see her noble lord restored to health,
Who for this seven years hath esteemed him
No better than a poor and loathsome beggar.
And if the boy have not a woman’s gift
To rain a shower of commanded tears,
An onion will do well for such a shift,
Which, in a napkin being close conveyed,
Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.
See this dispatched with all the haste thou canst.
Anon I’ll give thee more instructions.
