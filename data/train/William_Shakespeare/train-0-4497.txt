PORTIA Mark you but that? In both my eyes he doubly sees himself,
In each eye one. Swear by your double self,
And there’s an oath of credit. BASSANIO Nay, but hear me. Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear
I never more will break an oath with thee. ANTONIO (to Portia) I once did lend my body for his wealth
Which, but for him that had your husband’s ring,
Had quite miscarried. I dare be bound again,
My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord
Will never more break faith advisedly.
