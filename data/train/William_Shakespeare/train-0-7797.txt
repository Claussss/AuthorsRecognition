My lord, ’twere good you’d publish to the world
Your great offence unto his majesty. MORE My lord, I’ll bequeath this legacy to the hangman, and do it instantly. Gives him his gown I confess his majesty hath been ever good to me, and my
offence to his highness makes me of a state pleader, a
stage player—though I am old and have a bad voice—to
act this last scene of my tragedy. I’ll send him, for my
trespass, a reverend head: somewhat bald, for it is not
requisite any head should stand covered to so high
majesty. If that content him not, because I think my
body will then do me small pleasure, let him but bury it
and take it.
