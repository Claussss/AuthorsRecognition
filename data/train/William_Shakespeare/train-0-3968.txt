Now when thou wak’st with thine own fool’s eyes peep. Sound music. The music
changes  Come, my queen, take hands with me,
And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.
Oberon and Titania dance
Now thou and I are new in amity,
And will tomorrow midnight solemnly
Dance in Duke Theseus’ house, triumphantly,
And bless it to all fair prosperity.
There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be
Wedded with Theseus, all in jollity.
