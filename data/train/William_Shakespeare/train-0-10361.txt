Anger’s my meat, I sup upon myself,
And so shall starve with feeding.
(To Virgilia) Come, let’s go.
Leave this faint puling and lament as I do,
In anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come. Exeunt Volumnia and Virgilia Fie, fie, fie. 4.3
Enter Nicanor, a Roman, and Adrian, a Volscian 
NICANOR I know you well, sir, and you know me. Your name, I think, is Adrian.
