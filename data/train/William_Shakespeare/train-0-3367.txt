No good at all that I can do for him,
Unless you call it good to pity him,
Bereft and gelded of his patrimony. NORTHUMBERLAND Now afore God, ‘tis shame such wrongs are borne
In him, a royal prince, and many more
Of noble blood in this declining land.
The King is not himself, but basely led
By flatterers; and what they will inform
Merely in hate ’gainst any of us all,
That will the King severely prosecute
’Gainst us, our lives, our children, and our heirs.
