SHYLOCK Why, look you, how you storm I I would be friends with you, and have your love,
Forget the shames that you have stained me with,
Supply your present wants, and take no doit
Of usance for my moneys; and youâ€™ll not hear me.
This is kind I offer. BASSANIO This were kindness. SHYLOCK This kindness will I show.
