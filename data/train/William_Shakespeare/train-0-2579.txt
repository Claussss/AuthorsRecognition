The murdâ€™rous knife; and as it left the place
Her blood in poor revenge held it in chase, And bubbling from her breast it doth divide
In two slow rivers, that the crimson blood
Circles her body in on every side,
Who like a late-sacked island vastly stood,
Bare and unpeopled in this fearful flood. Some of her blood still pure and red remained,
And some looked black, and that false Tarquinstained.
