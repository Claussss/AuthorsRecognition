LORD CHAMBERLAIN An’t please your grace, Sir Thomas Boleyn’s daughter—
The Viscount Rochford—one of her highness’ women. By heaven, she is a dainty one. (To Anne) Sweetheart,
I were unmannerly to take you out
And not to kiss you kisses her Let it go round. CARDINAL WOLSEY Sir Thomas Lovell, is the banquet ready
I’th’ privy chamber?
