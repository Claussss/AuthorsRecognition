STEFANO (calls towards Ariel) If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness. If thou beest a devil, take’t as thou list. TRINCULO O, forgive me my sins! STEFANO He that dies pays all debts. (Calls) I defy thee.—Mercy upon us! CALIBAN Art thou afeard? STEFANO No, monster, not I. Be not afeard. The isle is full of noises,
Sounds, and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt
not.
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments
Will hum about mine ears, and sometime voices
That if I then had waked after long sleep
Will make me sleep again; and then in dreaming
The clouds methought would open and show riches
Ready to drop upon me, that when I waked
I cried to dream again.
