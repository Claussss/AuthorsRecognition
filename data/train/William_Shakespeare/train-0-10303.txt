The people are the city. By the consent of all We were established the people’s magistrates. You so remain. And so are like to do. That is the way to lay the city flat,
To bring the roof to the foundation,
And bury all which yet distinctly ranges
In heaps and piles of ruin. This deserves death. Or let us stand to our authority,
Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,
Upon the part o’th’ people in whose power
We were elected theirs, Martius is worthy
Of present death.
