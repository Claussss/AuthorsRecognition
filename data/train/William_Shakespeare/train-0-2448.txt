‘Have done,’ quoth he; ‘my uncontrolled tide
Turns not, but swells the higher by this let.
Small lights are soon blown out; huge fires abide,
And with the wind in greater fury fret.
The petty streams, that pay a daily debt To their salt sovereign, with their fresh falls’ haste
Add to his flow, but alter not his taste.’
