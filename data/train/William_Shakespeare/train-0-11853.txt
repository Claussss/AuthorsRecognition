By heaven I will, Or let me lose the fashion of a man.
KATHERINE
I thank you, honest lord. Remember me
In all humility unto his highness.
Say his long trouble now is passing
Out of this world. Tell him, in death I blessed him,
For so I will. Mine eyes grow dim. Farewell,
My lord. Griffith, farewell.
