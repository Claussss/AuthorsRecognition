Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free
For me as for you? GREMIO But so is not she. For what reason, I beseech you? For this reason, if you’ll know—
That she’s the choice love of Signor Gremio. That she’s the chosen of Signor Hortensio. Softly, my masters. If you be gentlemen,
Do me this right, hear me with patience.
Baptista is a noble gentleman
To whom my father is not all unknown,
And were his daughter fairer than she is
She may more suitors have, and me for one.
Fair Leda’s daughter had a thousand wooers;
Then well one more may fair Bianca have,
And so she shall. Lucentio shall make one,
Though Paris came, in hope to speed alone.
