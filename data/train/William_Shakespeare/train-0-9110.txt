Thanks to your majesty. Ourself will mingle with society
And play the humble host. Our hostess keeps her
state,
But in best time we will require her welcome. LADY MACBETH Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends,
For my heart speaks they are welcome.
Enter First Murderer [to the door] See, they encounter thee with their hearts’ thanks.
Both sides are even. Here I’ll sit, i’th’ midst.
Be large in mirth. Anon we’ll drink a measure
The table round. (To First Murderer) There’s blood
upon thy face.
