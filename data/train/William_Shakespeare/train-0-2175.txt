Every man’s conscience is a thousand swords
To fight against this guilty homicide. I doubt not but his friends will turn to us. He hath no friends but what are friends for fear,
Which in his dearest need will fly from him. HENRY EARL OF RICHMOND All for our vantage. Then, in God’s name, march.
True hope is swift, and flies with swallows’ wings;
Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.
