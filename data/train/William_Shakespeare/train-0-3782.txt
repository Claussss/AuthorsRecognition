Paris, Capulet and his Wife, and the Nurse all at once wring their hands and cry out together: Have I thought long to see this morningâ€™s face,
And doth it give me such a sight as this?
Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
Most detestable death, by thee beguiled,
By cruel, cruel thee quite overthrown.
O love, O life: not life, but love in death.
