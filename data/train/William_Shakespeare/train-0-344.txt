SECOND OUTLAW For what offence? For that which now torments me to rehearse.
I killed a man, whose death I much repent,
But yet I slew him manfully, in fight,
Without false vantage or base treachery. FIRST OUTLAW Why, neâ€™er repent it, if it were done so.
But were you banished for so small a fault? I was, and held me glad of such a doom.
