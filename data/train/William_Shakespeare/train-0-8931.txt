Hast thou gold yet? I’ll take the gold thou giv’st me,
Not all thy counsel. Dost thou or dost thou not, heaven’s curse upon thee! PHRYNIA and TIMANDRA Give us some gold, good Timon. Hast thou more? Enough to make a whore forswear her trade,
And to make wholesomeness a bawd. Hold up, you Your aprons mountant.
