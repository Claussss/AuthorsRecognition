Alas, poor man! Grief has so wrought on him
He takes false shadows for true substances. Come, take away. Lavinia, go with me.
Iâ€™ll to thy closet and go read with thee
Sad stories chanced in the times of old. Come, boy, and go with me. Thy sight is young,
And thou shalt read when mine begin to dazzle.
