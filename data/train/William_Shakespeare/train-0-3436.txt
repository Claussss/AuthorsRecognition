NORTHUMBERLAND My lord, in the base court he doth attend
To speak with you. May it please you to come down? KING RICHARD Down, down I come like glist’ring Phaethon,
Wanting the manage of unruly jades.
In the base court: base court where kings grow base
To come at traitors’ calls, and do them grace.
In the base court, come down: down court, down
King,
For night-owls shriek where mounting larks should sing.
