What trade, thou knave? Thou naughty knave, what trade? COBBLER Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me. Yet if you be out, sir, I can mend you. What mean’st thou by that? Mend me, thou saucy fellow? COBBLER Why, sir, cobble you. FLAVIUS Thou art a cobbler, art thou? COBBLER Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl. I meddle with no tradesman’s matters, nor women’s matters, but withal I am indeed, sir, a surgeon to old shoes: when they are in great danger I recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon neat’s leather have gone upon my handiwork.
