ROSS (rising) Gentlemen, rise. His highness is not well. LADY MACBETH (rising) Sit, worthy friends. My lord is often thus,
And hath been from his youth. Pray you, keep seat.
The fit is momentary. Upon a thought
He will again be well. If much you note him
You shall offend him, and extend his passion.
Feed, and regard him not.
