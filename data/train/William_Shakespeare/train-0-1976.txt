DUCHESS OF YORK Ah, that deceit should steal such gentle shapes,
And with a virtuous visor hide deep vice!
He is my son, ay, and therein my shame;
Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit. Think you my uncle did dissemble, grannam? DUCHESS OF YORK Ay, boy. I cannot think it. Hark, what noise is this?
