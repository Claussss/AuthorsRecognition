I am yours,
You valiant offspring of great Priamus.
I have a roisting challenge sent amongst
The dull and factious nobles of the Greeks
Will shriek amazement to their drowsy spirits.
I was advertised their great general slept
Whilst emulation in the army crept;
This I presume will wake him. Flourish.Exeunt
