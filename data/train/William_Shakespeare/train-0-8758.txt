[SECOND] CAPTAIN ’Tis true, my lords, he did. LEAR Did I not, fellow? I have seen the day with my good biting falchion
I would have made them skip. I am old now,
And these same crosses spoil me. (To Kent) Who are you?
Mine eyes are not o’ the best, I’ll tell you straight. If fortune bragged of two she loved or hated,
One of them we behold.
