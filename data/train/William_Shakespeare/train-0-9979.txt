THAISA Why, sir, say if you had, Who takes offence at that would make me glad? KING SIMONIDES How, minion, are you so peremptory?
(Aside) I am glad on’t.—Is this a fit match for you?
A straggling Theseus, born we know not where,
One that hath neither blood nor merit
For thee to hope for, or himself to challenge
Of thy perfections e’en the least allowance.
