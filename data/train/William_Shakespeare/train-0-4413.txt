Enter Portia, Nerissa, Lorenzo, Jessica, and Balthasar, a man of Portiaâ€™s 
LORENZO (to Portia) Madam, although I speak it in your presence,
You have a noble and a true conceit
Of godlike amity, which appears most strongly
In bearing thus the absence of your lord.
But if you knew to whom you show this honour,
How true a gentleman you send relief,
How dear a lover of my lord your husband,
I know you would be prouder of the work
Than customary bounty can enforce you.
