ULYSSES Give pardon to my speech: Therefore ’tis meet Achilles meet not Hector.
Let us like merchants show our foulest wares
And think perchance they’ll sell. If not,
The lustre of the better yet to show
Shall show the better. Do not consent
That ever Hector and Achilles meet,
For both our honour and our shame in this
Are dogged with two strange followers.
