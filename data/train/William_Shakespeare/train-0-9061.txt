There’s one did laugh in’s sleep, and one cried ‘Murder!’
That they did wake each other. I stood and heard
them.
But they did say their prayers and addressed them
Again to sleep. LADY MACBETH There are two lodged together. One cried ‘God bless us’ and ‘Amen’ the other,
As they had seen me with these hangman’s hands.
List‘ning their fear I could not say ‘Amen’
When they did say ‘God bless us.’
