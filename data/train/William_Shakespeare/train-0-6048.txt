OCTAVIUS (to Lepidus) Your brother too must die. Consent you, Lepidus? I do consent. OCTAVIUS Prick him down, Antony. Upon condition Publius shall not live,
Who is your sister’s son, Mark Antony. He shall not live. Look, with a spot I damn him.
But Lepidus, go you to Caesar’s house;
Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine
How to cut off some charge in legacies.
