Exeunt severally Sc. 15
Enter Edgar as a Bedlam beggar Yet better thus and known to be contemned
Than still contemned and flattered. To be worst,
The lowâ€™st and most dejected thing of fortune,
Stands still in esperance, lives not in fear.
The lamentable change is from the best;
The worst returns to laughter.
