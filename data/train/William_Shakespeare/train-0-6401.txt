HORATIO (to the Ghost) Stay, speak, speak, I charge thee speak. Exit Ghost MARCELLUS ’Tis gone, and will not answer. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
Is not this something more than fantasy?
What think you on’t? Before my God, I might not this believe
Without the sensible and true avouch
Of mine own eyes.
