Aut tu Erasmus aut diabolus. Your honourâ€™s merry humour is best physic
Unto your able body, for we learn
Where melancholy chokes the passages
Of blood and breath, the erected spirit still
Lengthens our days with sportful exercise.
Study should be the saddest time of life;
The rest a sport exempt from thought of strife.
