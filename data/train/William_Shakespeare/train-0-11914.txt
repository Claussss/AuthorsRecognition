THE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN BY JOHN FLETCHER AND WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE WHEN it first appeared in print, in 1634, The Two Noble Kinsmen was stated to be 25). The morris dance in Act 3, Scene 5, contains characters who also appear in Francis Beaumont’s Masque of the Inner Temple and Gray’s Inn performed before James I on 20 February 1613. Their dance was a great success with the King; probably the King’s Men—some of whom may have taken part in the masque—decided to exploit its success by incorporating it in a play written soon afterwards, in the last year of Shakespeare’s playwriting life.
