Enter Helen and the Widow Is there no exorcist Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes?
Is’t real that I see? No, my good lord, ’Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,
The name and not the thing. Both, both. O, pardon! O, my good lord, when I was like this maid
I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring.
And, look you, here’s your letter. This it says:
‘When from my finger you can get this ring,
And are by me with child,’ et cetera. This is done.
Will you be mine now you are doubly won?
