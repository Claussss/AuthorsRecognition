Margaret my name, and daughter to a king,
The King of Naples, whosoe’er thou art. An earl I am, and Suffolk am I called.
Be not offended, nature’s miracle,
Thou art allotted to be ta’en by me.
So doth the swan his downy cygnets save,
Keeping them prisoner underneath his wings.
Yet if this servile usage once offend,
Go, and be free again, as Suffolk’s friend.
