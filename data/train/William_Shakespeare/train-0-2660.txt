EARL OF WARWICK That he hath broke his faith with God and man,
And from them both stands excommunicate. KING EDWARD What office were it to suggest a man
To break a lawful and religious vow? EARL OF WARWICK An office for the devil, not for man. KING EDWARD That devil’s office must thou do for me,
Or break thy oath and cancel all the bonds
Of love and duty ‘twixt thyself and me.
And therefore, Warwick, if thou art thyself,
The lord and master of thy word and oath,
Go to thy daughter and, in my behalf,
Command her, woo her, win her any ways
To be my mistress and my secret love.
I will not stand to hear thee make reply;
Thy oath break hers, or let thy sovereign die. Exit
