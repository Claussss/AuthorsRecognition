CURIO He is not here, so please your lordship, that should sing it. ORSINO Who was it? CURIO Feste the jester, my lord, a fool that the lady Oliviaâ€™s father took much delight in. He is about the house. Seek him out, and play the tune the while. Exit Curio
Music plays
(To Viola) Come hither, boy. If ever thou shalt love,
In the sweet pangs of it remember me;
For such as I am, all true lovers are,
Unstaid and skittish in all motions else
Save in the constant image of the creature
That is beloved. How dost thou like this tune?
