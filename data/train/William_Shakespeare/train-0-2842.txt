Enter Dromio of Ephesus Here comes the almanac of my true date.
What now? How chance thou art returned so soon? DROMIO OF EPHESUS Returned so soon? Rather approached too late.
The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit.
The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;
My mistress made it one upon my cheek.
She is so hot because the meat is cold.
The meat is cold because you come not home.
You come not home because you have no stomach.
You have no stomach, having broke your fast;
But we that know what â€™tis to fast and pray
Are penitent for your default today.
