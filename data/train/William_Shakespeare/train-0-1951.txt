FIRST MURDERER Who made thee then a bloody minister
When gallant springing brave Plantagenet,
That princely novice, was struck dead by thee? My brother’s love, the devil, and my rage. FIRST MURDERER Thy brother’s love, our duty, and thy faults
Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee. If you do love my brother, hate not me.
I am his brother, and I love him well.
If you are hired for meed, go back again,
And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,
Who shall reward you better for my life
Than Edward will for tidings of my death.
