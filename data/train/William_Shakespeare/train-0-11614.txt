PROSPERO (to Alonso) Sir, I invite your highness and your train
To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest
For this one night; which part of it I’ll waste
With such discourse as I not doubt shall make it
Go quick away: the story of my life,
And the particular accidents gone by
Since I came to this isle. And in the morn
I’ll bring you to your ship, and so to Naples,
Where I have hope to see the nuptial
Of these our dear-belov
And thence retire me to my Milan, where
Every third thought shall be my grave.
