God’s arm strike with us! ‘Tis a fearful odds.
God b’wi’ you, princes all. I’ll to my charge.
If we no more meet till we meet in heaven,
Then joyfully, my noble Lord of Clarence,
My dear Lord Gloucester, and my good Lord Exeter,
And (to Warwick) my kind kinsman, warriors all,
adieu. Farewell, good Salisbury, and good luck go with thee.
