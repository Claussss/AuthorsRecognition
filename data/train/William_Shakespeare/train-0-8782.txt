LUCILIUS (coming forward) Here at your lordshipâ€™s service. OLD ATHENIAN This fellow here, Lord Timon, this thy creature,
By night frequents my house. I am a man
That from my first have been inclined to thrift,
And my estate deserves an heir more raised
Than one which holds a trencher. TIMON Well, what further?
