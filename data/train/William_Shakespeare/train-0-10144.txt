Would the nobility lay aside their ruth
And let me use my sword, Iâ€™d make a quarry
With thousands of these quartered slaves as high
As I could pitch my lance. Nay, these are all most thoroughly persuaded,
For though abundantly they lack discretion,
Yet are they passing cowardly. But I beseech you,
What says the other troop?
