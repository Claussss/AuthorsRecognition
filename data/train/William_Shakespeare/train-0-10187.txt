MARTIUS Come I too late? The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabor
More than I know the sound of Martiusâ€™ tongue
From every meaner man. MARTIUS Come I too late? Ay, if you come not in the blood of others,
But mantled in your own. MARTIUS O, let me clip ye In arms as sound as when I wooed, in heart
As merry as when our nuptial day was done,
And tapers burnt to bedward!
