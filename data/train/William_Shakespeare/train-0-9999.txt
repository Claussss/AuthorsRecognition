That is the cause we trouble you so early;
’Tis not our husbandry. CERIMON O, you say well. FIRST GENTLEMAN But I much marvel that your lordship should,
Having rich tire about you, at this hour
Shake off the golden slumber of repose. ’Tis most

Nature to be so conversant with pain,
Being thereto not compelled.
