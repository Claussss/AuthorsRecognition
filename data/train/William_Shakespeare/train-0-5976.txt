CALPURNIA Alas, my lord, Your wisdom is consumed in confidence.
Do not go forth today. Call it my fear
That keeps you in the house, and not your own.
Weâ€™ll send Mark Antony to the Senate House,
And he shall say you are not well today.
Let me upon my knee prevail in this. Mark Antony shall say I am not well,
And for thy humour I will stay at home.
