QUEEN ELIZABETH Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse
Abides in me; I say ‘Amen’ to all. KING RICHARD Stay, madam. I must talk a word with you. QUEEN ELIZABETH I have no more sons of the royal blood
For thee to slaughter. For my daughters, Richard,
They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens,
And therefore level not to hit their lives.
