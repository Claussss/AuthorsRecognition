Nay, pray be patient. If you refuse your aid
In this so never-needed help, yet do not
Upbraid’s with our distress. But sure, if you
Would be your country’s pleader, your good tongue,
More than the instant army we can make,
Might stop our countryman. No, I’ll not meddle. Pray you go to him. What should I do?
