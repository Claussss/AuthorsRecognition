NESTOR Well, and how? This challenge that the gallant Hector sends,
However it is spread in general name,
Relates in purpose only to Achilles. The purpose is perspicuous, even as substance
Whose grossness little characters sum up.
And, in the publication, make no strain
But that Achilles, were his brain as barren
As banks of Libya—though, Apollo knows,
’Tis dry enough—will with great speed of judgement,
Ay with celerity, find Hector’s purpose
Pointing on him.
