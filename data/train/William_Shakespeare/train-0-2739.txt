The Prince kneels and kisses his father’s hand PRINCE OF WALES First, having done my duty as beseemed,
Lords, I regreet you all with hearty thanks.
And now behold after my winter’s toil
My painful voyage on the boist’rous sea
Of war’s devouring gulfs and steely rocks
I bring my freight unto the wished port,
My summer’s hope, my travail’s sweet reward.
(Pointing at Bohemia’s body) And here, with humble duty, I present
This sacrifice, this first fruit of my sword,
Cropped and cut down even at the gate of death:
The King of Boh
Whose thousands had entrenched me round about,
And lay as thick upon my battered crest
As on an anvil with their ponderous glaives.
Yet marble courage still did underprop,
And when my weary arms with often blows,
Like the continual labouring woodman’s axe
That is enjoined to fell a load of oaks,
Began to falter, straight I would recover
My gifts you gave me and my zealous vow,
And then new courage made me fresh again
That, in despite, I carved my passage forth,
And put the multitude to speedy flight.
Lo, thus hath Edward’s hand filled your request
And done, I hope, the duty of a knight.
