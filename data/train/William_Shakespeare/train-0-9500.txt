What would my lord? Since Cleopatra died I have lived in such dishonour that the gods
Detest my baseness. I, that with my sword
Quartered the world, and o’er green Neptune’s back
With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack
The courage of a woman; less noble mind
Than she which by her death our Caesar tells
‘I am conqueror of myself.’ Thou art sworn, Eros,
That when the exigent should come, which now
Is come indeed—when I should see behind me
Th’inevitable prosecution of
Disgrace and horror—that on my command
Thou then wouldst kill me. Do’t. The time is come.
Thou strik‘st not me; ’tis Caesar thou defeat’st.
Put colour in thy cheek.
