But will the King Digest this letter of the Cardinal’s?
The Lord forbid! Marry, amen. There be more wasps that buzz about his nose
Will make this sting the sooner. Cardinal Campeius
Is stol’n away to Rome; hath ta’en no leave;
Has left the cause o’th’ King unhandled, and
Is posted as the agent of our Cardinal
To second all his plot. I do assure you
The King cried ‘Ha!’ at this.
