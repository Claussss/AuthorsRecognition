That is some satire, keen and critical,
Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony. ‘A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus
And his love Thisbe: very tragical mirth.’ ‘Merry’ and ‘tragical’? ‘Tedious’ and ’brief?—
That is, hot ice and wondrous strange black snow.
How shall we find the concord of this discord?
