How’s this, how’s this? Some more. Be sage. MARINA kneeling That am a maid, though most ungentle fortune
Have franked me in this sty, where since I came
Diseases have been sold dearer than physic—
That the gods would set me free from this unhallowed
place,
Though they did change me to the meanest bird
That flies i’th’ purer air!
