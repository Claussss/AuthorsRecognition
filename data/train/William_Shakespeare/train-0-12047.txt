FOURTH COUNTRYMAN Now, when the credit of our town lay on it,
Now to be frampold, now to piss o’th’ nettle!
Go thy ways—I’ll remember thee, I’ll fit thee! Enter the Jailer’s Daughter JAILER’S DAUGHTER (sings) The George Alow came from the south,
From the coast of Barbary-a;
And there he met with brave gallants of war,
By one, by two, by three-a.
‘Well hailed, well hailed, you jolly gallants,
And whither now are you bound-a?
O let me have your company
Till I come to the sound-a.’
