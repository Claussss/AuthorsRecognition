Then God forgive the sin of all those souls
That to their everlasting residence,
Before the dew of evening fall, shall fleet 285
In dreadful trial of our kingdom’s king. KING PHILIP Amen, Amen! Mount, chevaliers! To arms! Saint George that swinged the dragon, and e’er since
Sits on’s horseback at mine hostess’ door,
Teach us some fence! (To Austria) Sirrah, were I at
home 290
At your den, sirrah, with your lioness,
I would set an ox-head to your lion’s hide
And make a monster of you.
