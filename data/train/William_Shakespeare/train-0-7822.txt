Where is the fellow? I am glad to hear it.
Falkner is brought Here, my good lord. You mock me, surely. This is not the man. Yes indeed, my lord, I am he. MORE Thou art not, sure. The other was an ugly, filthy knave;
Thou a good-featured and well-favoured man.
Why, see what monsters you will make yourselves
By cherishing a loathsome excrement
Tâ€™abuse the goodly image of a man
Whom God did frame so excellent a creature.
Well, be a peaceable and civil man.
I do discharge thee.
