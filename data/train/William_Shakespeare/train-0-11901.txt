Good master puppy. (To his man) Keep the door close,

to muster in? Or have we some strange Indian with
the great tool come to court, the women so besiege us?
Bless me, what a fry of fornication is at door! On my
Christian conscience, this one christening will beget a
thousand. Here will be father, godfather, and all
together.
