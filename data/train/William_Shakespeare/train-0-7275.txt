Hold, patience! ULYSSES (aside) How now, Trojan? CRESSIDA Diomed. No, no, good night. Iâ€™ll be your fool no more. TROILUS (aside) Thy better must. CRESSIDA Hark, one word in your ear. She whispers to him TROILUS (aside) O plague and madness! ULYSSES (aside) You are moved, Prince. Let us depart, I pray you,
Lest your displeasure should enlarge itself
To wrathful terms. This place is dangerous,
The time right deadly. I beseech you go.
