This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served for—
A thing not in his power to bring to pass,
But swayed and fashioned by the hand of heaven.
Was this inserted to make interest good,
Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams? I cannot tell. I make it breed as fast.
But note me, signor— ANTONIO Mark you this, Bassanio?
