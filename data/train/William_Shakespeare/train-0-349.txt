FIRST OUTLAW But if thou scorn our courtesy, thou diest. SECOND OUTLAW Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offered. I take your offer, and will live with you,
Provided that you do no outrages

Come, go with us. Weâ€™ll bring thee to our crews
And show thee all the treasure we have got,
Which, with ourselves, all rest at thy dispose. Exeunt
