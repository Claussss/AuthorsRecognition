I have more cause. CELIA Thou hast not, cousin. Prithee, be cheerful. Know’st thou not the Duke
Hath banished me, his daughter? ROSALIND That he hath not. No, hath not? Rosalind, lack’st thou then the love
Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one?
Shall we be sundered? Shall we part, sweet girl?
No. Let my father seek another heir.
Therefore devise with me how we may fly,
Whither to go, and what to bear with us,
And do not seek to take your change upon you,
To bear your griefs yourself, and leave me out.
For by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,
Say what thou canst, I’ll go along with thee.
