KING RICHARD Come, bustle, bustle! Caparison my horse. Richard arms Call up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power.
I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain,
And thus my battle shall be order
My forward shall be drawn out all in length,
Consisting equally of horse add foot,
Our archers plac
John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey,
Shall have the leading of this multitude.
They thus directed, we ourself will follow
In the main battle, whose puissance on both sides
Shall be well wing
This, and Saint George to boot! What thinkâ€™st thou, Norfolk?
