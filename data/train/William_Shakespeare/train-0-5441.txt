CLAUDIO How know you he loves her? DON JOHN I heard him swear his affection. BORACHIO So did I, too, and he swore he would marry her tonight. DON JOHN Come, let us to the banquet. Exeunt all but Claudio Thus answer I in name of Benedick,
But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.
â€™Tis certain so, the Prince woos for himself.
Friendship is constant in all other things
Save in the office and affairs of love.
Therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues.
Let every eye negotiate for itself,
And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch
Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.
This is an accident of hourly proof,
Which I mistrusted not. Farewell, therefore, Hero.
