5.2
Enter Charles the Dauphin reading a letter, the Dukes of Burgundy and Alen These news, my lords, may cheer our drooping spirits.
â€˜Tis said the stout Parisians do revolt
And turn again unto the warlike French. Then march to Paris, royal Charles of France,
And keep not back your powers in dalliance.
