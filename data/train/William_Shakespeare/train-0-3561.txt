MONTAGUE’S WIFE O where is Romeo—saw you him today?
Right glad I am he was not at this fray. Madam, an hour before the worshipped sun
Peered forth the golden window of the east,
A troubled mind drive me to walk abroad,
Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
That westward rooteth from this city side,
So early walking did I see your son.
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me,
And stole into the covert of the wood.
I, measuring his affections by my own—
Which then most sought where most might not be
found,
Being one too many by my weary self—
Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
And gladly shunned who gladly fled from me.
