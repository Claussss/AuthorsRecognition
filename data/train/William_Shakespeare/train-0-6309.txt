So holy and so perfect is my love,
And I in such a poverty of grace,
That I shall think it a most plenteous crop
To glean the broken ears after the man
That the main harvest reaps. Loose now and then
A scattered smile, and that I’ll live upon. Know’st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile? Not very well, but I have met him oft,
And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
That the old Carlot once was master of.
