If that it be the work of any hand? 60
We had a kind of light what would ensue:
It is the shameful work of Hubertâ€™s hand,
The practice and the purpose of the King; From whose obedience I forbid my soul,
Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life, 65
And breathing to his breathless excellence
The incense of a vow, a holy vow,
Never to taste the pleasures of the world,
Never to be infected with delight,
Nor conversant with ease and idleness, 70
Till I have set a glory to this hand
By giving it the worship of revenge.
