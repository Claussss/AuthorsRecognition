FOOL (to Lear) For, you trow, nuncle, The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long
That it had it head bit off by it young;  so out went the candle, and we were left darkling. LEAR (to Gonoril) Are you our daughter? Come, sir, I would you would make use of that good
wisdom
Whereof I know you are fraught, and put away
These dispositions that of late transform you
From what you rightly are.
