Enter Macbeth and Banquo So foul and fair a day I have not seen. How far is’t called to Forres?—What are these,
So withered, and so wild in their attire,
That look not like th‘inhabitants o’th’ earth
And yet are on’t?—Live you, or are you aught
That man may question? You seem to understand me
By each at once her choppy finger laying
Upon her skinny lips. You should be women,
And yet your beards forbid me to interpret
That you are so.
