Proud Saturnine, interrupter of the good
That noble-minded Titus means to thee. Content thee, Prince. I will restore to thee
The peopleâ€™s hearts, and wean them from themselves. Andronicus, I do not flatter thee
But honour thee, and will do till I die.
My faction if thou strengthen with thy friends
I will most thankful be; and thanks to men
Of noble minds is honourable meed.
