FIRST GENTLEMAN Yes, but it held not. For when the King once heard it, out of anger
He sent command to the Lord Mayor straight
To stop the rumour and allay those tongues
That durst disperse it. SECOND GENTLEMAN But that slander, sir, Is found a truth now, for it grows again
Fresher than eâ€™er it was, and held for certain
The King will venture at it. Either the Cardinal
Or some about him near have, out of malice
To the good Queen, possessed him with a scruple
That will undo her. To confirm this, too,
Cardinal Campeius is arrived, and lately,
As all think, for this business.
