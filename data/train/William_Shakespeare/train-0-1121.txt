EDWARD (to Queen Margaret) And in this resolution I defy thee,
Not willing any longer conference
Since thou deniest the gentle King to speak.
Sound trumpets—let our bloody colours wave!
And either victory, or else a grave! QUEEN MARGARET Stay, Edward. No, wrangling woman, we’ll no longer stay—
These words will cost ten thousand lives this day.
