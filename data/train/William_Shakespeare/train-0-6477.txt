QUEEN GERTRUDE Came this from Hamlet to her? Good madam, stay a while. I will be faithful.
‘Doubt thou the stars are fire,
Doubt that the sun doth move,
Doubt truth to be a liar,
But never doubt I love.
O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers. I have not
art to reckon my groans. But that I love thee best, O
most best, believe it. Adieu.
Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this
machine is to him,
Hamlet.’
This in obedience hath my daughter showed me,
And more above hath his solicitings,
As they fell out by time, by means, and place,
All given to mine ear.
