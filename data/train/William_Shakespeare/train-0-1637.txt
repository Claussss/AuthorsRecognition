It doth, my worthy lord, and in this match
I hold me highly honoured of your grace,
And here in sight of Rome to Saturnine,
King and commander of our commonweal,
The wide world’s emperor, do I consecrate
My sword, my chariot, and my prisoners—
Presents well worthy Rome’s imperious lord.
Receive them, then, the tribute that I owe,
Mine honour’s ensigns humbled at thy feet.
