CASSIO I found it in my chamber, And he himself confessed it, but even now,
That there he dropped it for a special purpose
Which wrought to his desire. OTHELLO O fool, fool, fool! There is besides in Roderigoâ€™s letter
How he upbraids Iago, that he made him
Brave me upon the watch, whereon it came
That I was cast; and even but now he spake
After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,
Iago set him on.
