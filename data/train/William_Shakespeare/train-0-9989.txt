Enter Lychorida with an infant Here is a thing too young for such a place,
Who, if it had conceit, would die, as I
Am like to do. Take in your arms this piece
Of your dead queen. PERICLES How, how, Lychorida? Patience, good sir, do not assist the storm.
Hereâ€™s all that is left living of your queen,
A little daughter. For the sake of it
Be manly, and take comfort.
