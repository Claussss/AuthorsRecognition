‘Look, look, how list’ning Priam wets his eyes
To see those borrowed tears that Sinon sheds.
Priam, why art thou old and yet not wise?
For every tear he falls a Trojan bleeds.
His eye drops fire, no water thence proceeds. Those round clear pearls of his that move thy pity
Are balls of quenchless fire to burn thy city.
