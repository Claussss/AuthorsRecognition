Sir Richard Ratcliffe, let me tell thee this:
Today shalt thou behold a subject die
For truth, for duty, and for loyalty. GRAY (to Ratcliffe) God bless the Prince from all the pack of you!
A knot you are of damned bloodsuckers. VAUGHAN (to Ratcliffe) You live, that shall cry woe for this hereafter. Dispatch. The limit of your lives is out.
