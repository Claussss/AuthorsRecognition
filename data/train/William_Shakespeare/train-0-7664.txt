We are deluded. This is not his lordship. RANDALL I pray you, Erasmus, how long will the Holland cheese in your country keep without maggots? Fool, painted barbarism, retire thyself
Into thy first creation. Thus you see,
My loving learned friends, how far respect
Waits often on the ceremonious train
Of base illiterate wealth, whilst men of schools,
Shrouded in poverty, are counted fools.
Pardon, thou reverend German, I have mixed
So slight a jest to the fair entertainment
Of thy most worthy self. For know, Erasmus,
Mirth wrinkles up my face, and I still crave
When that forsakes me I may hug my grave.
