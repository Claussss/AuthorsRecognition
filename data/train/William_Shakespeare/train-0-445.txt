Gentlemen, importune me no farther,
For how I firmly am resolved you know:
That is, not to bestow my youngest daughter
Before I have a husband for the elder.
If either of you both love Katherina,
Because I know you well and love you well
Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure. To cart her rather. Sheâ€™s too rough for me.
There, there, Hortensio. Will you any wife?
