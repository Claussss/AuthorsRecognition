O, name him not! Let us not break with him,
For he will never follow anything
That other men begin. CASSIUS Then leave him out. CASCA Indeed he is not fit. Shall no man else be touched, but only Caesar? Decius, well urged. I think it is not meet
Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,
Should outlive Caesar. We shall find of him
A shrewd contriver. And you know his means,
If he improve them, may well stretch so far
As to annoy us all; which to prevent,
Let Antony and Caesar fall together.
