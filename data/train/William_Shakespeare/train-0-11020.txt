CORDELIA (to Lear) How does my royal lord? How fares your majesty? You do me wrong to take me out o’th’ grave.
Thou art a soul in bliss, but I am bound
Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears
Do scald like molten lead. Sir, do you know me? You are a spirit, I know. Where did you die? CORDELIA (to the Gentleman) Still, still far wide!
