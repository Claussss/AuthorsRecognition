Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxfordcome forward PRINCE EDWARD To Edward, but not to the English king. QUEEN MARGARET Deceitful Warwick—it was thy device
By this alliance to make void my suit!
Before thy coming Louis was Henry’s friend. And still is friend to him and Margaret.
But if your title to the crown be weak,
As may appear by Edward’s good success,
Then ’tis but reason that I be released
From giving aid which late I promised.
Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand
That your estate requires and mine can yield.
