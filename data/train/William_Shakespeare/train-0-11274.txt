More slavish did I neâ€™er than answering
A slave without a knock. CLOTEN Thou art a robber, A law-breaker, a villain. Yield thee, thief. To who? To thee? What art thou? Have not I
An arm as big as thine, a heart as big?
Thy words, I grant, are bigger, for I wear not
My dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art,
Why I should yield to thee.
