QUEEN MARGARET (aside) Out, devil! I remember them too well.
Thou killed’st my husband Henry in the Tower,
And Edward, my poor son, at Tewkesbury. RICHARD GLOUCESTER (to Elizabeth) Ere you were queen—ay, or your husband king—
I was a packhorse in his great affairs,
A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
A liberal rewarder of his friends.
To royalize his blood, I spent mine own.
