Sir, I commend you to your own content. Exit ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE He that commends me to mine own content
Commends me to the thing I cannot get.
I to the world am like drop of water
That in the ocean seeks another drop,
Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,
Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself.
So I, to find a mother and a brother,
In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.
