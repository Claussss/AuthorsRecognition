Sirrah, come hither. ‘Tis no time to jest,
And therefore frame your manners to the time.
Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life
Puts my apparel and my count’nance on,
And I for my escape have put on his,
For in a quarrel since I came ashore
I killed a man, and fear I was descried.
Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,
While I make way from hence to save my life.
You understand me?
