Do, good my friend. Exit Clown In happy time, Iago. You ha’ not been abed, then. CASSIO Why, no. The day had broke Before we parted. I ha’ made bold, Iago,
To send in to your wife. My suit to her
Is that she will to virtuous Desdemona
Procure me some access. I’ll send her to you presently,
And I’ll devise a mean to draw the Moor
Out of the way, that your converse and business
May be more free.
