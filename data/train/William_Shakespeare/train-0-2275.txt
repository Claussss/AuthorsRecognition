‘How like a jade he stood tied to the tree,
Servilely mastered with a leathern rein!
But when he saw his love, his youth’s fair fee,
He held such petty bondage in disdain, Throwing the base thong from his bending crest,
Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast. ‘Who sees his true-love in her naked bed,
Teaching the sheets a whiter hue than white,
But when his glutton eye so full hath fed
His other agents aim at like delight?
