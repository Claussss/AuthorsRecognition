Enter Corporal Nim and Lieutenant Bardolph 
BARDOLPH Well met, Corporal Nim. NIM Good morrow, Lieutenant Bardolph. BARDOLPH What, are Ensign Pistol and you friends yet? NIM For my part, I care not. I say little, but when time shall serve, there shall be smiles—but that shall be as it may. I dare not fight, but I will wink and hold out mine iron. It is a simple one, but what though? It will toast cheese, and it will endure cold, as another man’s sword will—and there’s an end.
