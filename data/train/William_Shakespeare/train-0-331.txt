3.2
Enter the Duke and Thurio Sir Thurio, fear not but that she will love you
Now Valentine is banished from her sight. Since his exile she hath despised me most,
Forsworn my company, and railed at me,
That I am desperate of obtaining her. This weak impress of love is as a figure
Trenched in ice, which with an hourâ€™s heat
Dissolves to water and doth lose his form.
A little time will melt her frozen thoughts,
And worthless Valentine shall be forgot.
