I know not what to say, but give me your hands.
God send you joy, Petruccio! ’Tis a match. GREMIO and TRANIO Amen, say we. We will be witnesses. Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu.
I will to Venice. Sunday comes apace.
We will have rings, and things, and fine array;
And kiss me, Kate. We will be married o’ Sunday.
