O perdurable shame! Letâ€™s stab ourselves:
Be these the wretches that we played at dice for? Is this the king we sent to for his ransom? Shame, an eternall shame, nothing but shame!
Let us die in pride. In once more, back again!
And he that will not follow Bourbon now,
Let him go home, and with his cap in hand
Like a base leno hold the chamber door,
Whilst by a slave no gentler than my dog
His fairest daughter is contaminated.
