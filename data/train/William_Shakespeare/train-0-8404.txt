By heaven, I saw my handkerchief inâ€™s hand.
O perjured woman! Thou dost stone my heart,
And makes me call what I intend to do
A murder, which I thought a sacrifice.
I saw the handkerchief. DESDEMONA He found it, then. I never gave it him. Send for him hither.
Let him confess a truth. OTHELLO He hath confessed.
