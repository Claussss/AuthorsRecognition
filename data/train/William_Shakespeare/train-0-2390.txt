Now stole upon the time the dead of night
When heavy sleep had closed up mortal eyes.
No comfortable star did lend his light,
No noise but owls’ and wolves’ death-boding cries
Now serves the season, that they may surprise The silly lambs. Pure thoughts are dead and still,
While lust and murder wakes to stain and kill.
