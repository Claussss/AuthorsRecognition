Then, heaven, set ope thy everlasting gates
To entertain my vows of thanks and praise.
(To the multitudes below)
Soldiers, this day have you redeemed your lives,
And showed how well you love your prince and
country.
Continue still in this so good a mind,
And Henry, though he be infortunate,
Assure yourselves will never be unkind.
And so, with thanks and pardon to you all,
I do dismiss you to your several countries.
