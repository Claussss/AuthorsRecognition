FALKNER My lord— Cut off this fleece and lie there but a month. FALKNER I’ll not lose a hair to be Lord Chancellor of Europe. To Newgate then. Sirrah, great sins are bred
In all that body where there’s a foul head.
Away with him. Exeunt all but Randall Enter Surrey, Erasmus, and attendants Now, great Erasmus, you approach the presence
Of a most worthy learned gentleman.
This little isle holds not a truer friend
Unto the arts; nor doth his greatness add
A feigned flourish to his worthy parts.
He’s great in study: that’s the statist’s grace
That gains more reverence than the outward place.
