True, son, here’s not so, Nor does the wanton tongue here screw itself
Into the ear, that like a vice drinks up
The iron instrument. We are here at peace. MORE Then peace, good wife. For keeping still in compass—a strange point
In time’s new navigation—we have sailed
Beyond our course. We are exiled the court.
