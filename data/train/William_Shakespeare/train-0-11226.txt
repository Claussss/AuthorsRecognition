O gracious lady, Since I received command to do this business
I have not slept one wink. Do’t, and to bed, then. I’ll wake mine eyeballs out first. Wherefore then Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abused
So many miles with a pretence?—this place,
Mine action, and thine own? Our horses’ labour,
The time inviting thee? The perturbed court,
For my being absent, whereunto I never
Purpose return? Why hast thou gone so far
To be unbent when thou hast ta‘en thy stand,
Th’elected deer before thee?
