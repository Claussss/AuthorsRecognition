JAILER’S DAUGHTER She is horribly in love with him, poor beast,
But he is like his master—coy and scornful. What dowry has she? JAILER’S DAUGHTER Some two hundred bottles
 And twenty strike of oats, but he’ll ne’er have her.
He lisps in’s neighing, able to entice
A miller’s mare. He’ll be the death of her.
