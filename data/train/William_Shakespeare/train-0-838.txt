CARDINAL BEAUFORT (to King Henry) My liege, his railing is intolerable.
If those that care to keep your royal person
From treason’s secret knife and traitor’s rage
Be thus upbraided, chid, and rated at,
And the offender granted scope of speech,
‘Twill make them cool in zeal unto your grace. SUFFOLK (to King Henry)
