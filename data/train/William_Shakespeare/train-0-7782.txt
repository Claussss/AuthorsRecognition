Enter Lady More, mourning, Daughters, [one of them Roper’s Wife,] Master Roper LIEUTENANT O noble More! My lord, your wife, your son-in-law and daughters. Son Roper, welcome. Welcome, wife and girls.
Why do you weep? Because I live at ease?
Did you not see, when I was Chancellor
I was so cloyed with suitors every hour
I could not sleep nor dine nor sup in quiet.
Here’s none of this. Here I can sit and talk
With my honest keeper half a day together,
Laugh and be merry. Why then should you weep?
