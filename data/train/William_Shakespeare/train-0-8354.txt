I hope my noble lord esteems me honest. O, ay—as summer flies are in the shambles,
That quicken even with blowing. O thou weed,
Who art so lovely fair, and smell‘st so sweet,
That the sense aches at thee—would thou hadst ne’er
been born! Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed? Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,
Made to write ‘whore’ upon? What committed?
Committed? O thou public commoner,
I should make very forges of my cheeks,
That would to cinders burn up modesty,
Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed?
Heaven stops the nose at it, and the moon winks;
The bawdy wind, that kisses all it meets,
Is hushed within the hollow mine of earth
And will not hear’t. What committed?
