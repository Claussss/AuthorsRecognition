Enter Richard Duke of Gloucester, the Duke of
Buckingham, Lord Stanley Earl of Derby, Lord
Hastings, and Sir Richard Ratcliffe RICHARD GLOUCESTER (to Elizabeth) Sister, have comfort. All of us have cause
To wail the dimming of our shining star,
But none can help our harms by wailing them.â€”
Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy.
I did not see your grace. Humbly on my knee
I crave your blessing.
