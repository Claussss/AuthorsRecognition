HELEN (to Bertram) I dare not say I take you, but I give
Me and my service ever whilst I live
Into your guiding power.—This is the man. Why then, young Bertram, take her, she’s thy wife. My wife, my liege? I shall beseech your highness,
In such a business give me leave to use
The help of mine own eyes.
