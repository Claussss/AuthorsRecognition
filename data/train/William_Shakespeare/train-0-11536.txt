STEFANO That’s most certain. Thou shalt be lord of it, and I’ll serve thee. STEFANO How now shall this be compassed? Canst thou bring me to the party? Yea, yea, my lord. I’ll yield him thee asleep
Where thou mayst knock a nail into his head. ARIEL Thou liest, thou canst not. What a pied ninny’s thisl (To Tririculo) Thou scurvy
patch!
(To Stefano) I do beseech thy greatness give him blows,
And take his bottle from him. When that’s gone
He shall drink naught but brine, for I’ll not show him
Where the quick freshes are.
