ULYSSES Now, great Thetis’ son. ACHILLES What are you reading? ULYSSES A strange fellow here Writes me that man, how dearly ever parted,
How much in having, or without or in,
Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,
Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection—
As when his virtues, shining upon others,
Heat them, and they retort that heat again
To the first givers.
