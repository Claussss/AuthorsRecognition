BUCKINGHAM’S SURVEYOR He was brought to this By a vain prophecy of Nicholas Hopkins. What was that Hopkins? BUCKINGHAM’S SURVEYOR Sir, a Chartreux friar, His confessor, who fed him every minute
With words of sovereignty. How know’st thou this? BUCKINGHAM’S SURVEYOR Not long before your highness sped to France,
The Duke being at the Rose, within the parish
Saint Lawrence Poutney, did of me demand
What was the speech among the Londoners
Concerning the French journey. I replied
Men feared the French would prove perfidious,
To the King’s danger; presently the Duke
Said ‘twas the fear indeed, and that he doubted
’Twould prove the verity of certain words
Spoke by a holy monk that oft, says he,
‘Hath sent to me, wishing me to permit
John de la Car, my chaplain, a choice hour
To hear from him a matter of some moment;
Whom after under the confession’s seal
He solemnly had sworn, that what he spoke
My chaplain to no creature living but
To me should utter, with demure confidence
This pausingly ensued: “neither the King nor’s heirs”,
Tell you the Duke, “shall prosper. Bid him strive
To win the love o’th’ commonalty. The Duke
Shall govern England.” ’
