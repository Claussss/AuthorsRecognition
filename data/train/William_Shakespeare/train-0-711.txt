So God help Warwick, as he loves the land,
And common profit of his country! And so says York, (aside) for he hath greatest cause. Then let’s away, and look unto the main. Unto the main? O, father, Maine is lost !
That Maine which by main force Warwick did win,
And would have kept so long as breath did last!
Main chance, father, you meant—but I meant Maine,
Which I will win from France or else be slain.
