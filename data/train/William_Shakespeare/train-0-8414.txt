My husband? OTHELLO Thy husband. EMILIA That she was false to wedlock? Ay, with Cassio. Had she been true,
If heaven would make me such another world
Of one entire and perfect chrysolite
I’d not have sold her for it. EMILIA My husband? Ay, ’twas he that told me on her first.
An honest man he is, and hates the slime
That sticks on filthy deeds.
