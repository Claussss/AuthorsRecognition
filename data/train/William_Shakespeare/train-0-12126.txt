I am in labour
 To push your name, your ancient love, our kindred,
Out of my memory, and i’th’ selfsame place
To seat something I would confound. So hoist we
The sails that must these vessels port even where
The heavenly limiter pleases. You speak well.
 Before I turn, let me embrace thee, cousin—
This I shall never do again.
