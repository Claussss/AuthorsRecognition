O monstrous traitor! I arrest thee, York,
Of capital treason ’gainst the King and crown.
Obey, audacious traitor; kneel for grace. YORK (to an attendant) Sirrah, call in my sons to be my bail. Exit attendant
I know, ere they will have me go to ward,
They’ll pawn their swords for my enfranchisement. QUEEN MARGARET to Buckingham
