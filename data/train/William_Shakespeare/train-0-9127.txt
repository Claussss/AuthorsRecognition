SPIRITS (singing dispersedly within) Come away, come away.
Hecate, Hecate, come away. Hark, I am called! My little spirit, see,
Sits in a foggy cloud and stays for me. SPIRITS within Come away, come away,
Hecate, Hecate, come away. I come, I come, I come, I come,
With all the speed I may,
With all the speed I may.
