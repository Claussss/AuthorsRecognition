But were some child of yours alive that time, You should live twice: in it, and in my rhyme.
18 Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed,
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance or nature’s changing course untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow‘st,
Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade
When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st.
