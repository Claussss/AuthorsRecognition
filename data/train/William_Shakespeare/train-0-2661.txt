EARL OF WARWICK O doting king! O detestable office!
Well may I tempt myself to wrong myself,
When he hath sworn me by the name of God
To break a vow made by the name of God.
What if I swear by this right hand of mine
To cut this right hand off? The better way
Were to profane the idol than confound it,
But neither will I do. I’ll keep mine oath
And to my daughter make a recantation
Of all the virtue I have preached to her.
I’ll say she must forget her husband, Salisbury—
If she remember to embrace the King.
I’ll say an oath may easily be broken—
But not so easily pardoned, being broken.
I’ll say it is true charity to love—
But not true love to be so charitable.
I’ll say his greatness may bear out the shame—
But not his kingdom can buy out the sin.
I’ll say it is my duty to persuade—
But not her honesty to give consent.
