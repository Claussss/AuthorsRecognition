What, what, my lord? Are you so choleric
With Eleanor for telling but her dream?
Next time I’ll keep my dreams unto myself
And not be checked. Nay, be not angry; I am pleased again. Enter a Messenger My Lord Protector, ’tis his highness’ pleasure
You do prepare to ride unto Saint Albans,
Whereas the King and Queen do mean to hawk.
