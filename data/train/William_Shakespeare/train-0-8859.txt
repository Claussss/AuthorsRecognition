FLAMINIUS His health is well, sir. LUCULLUS I am right glad that his health is well, sir. And what hast thou there under thy cloak, pretty Flaminius? FLAMINIUS Faith, nothing but an empty box, sir, which in my lordâ€™s behalf I come to entreat your honour to supply, who, having great and instant occasion to use fifty talents, hath sent to your lordship to furnish him, nothing doubting your present assistance therein.
