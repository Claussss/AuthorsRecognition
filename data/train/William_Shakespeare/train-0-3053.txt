COSTARD I had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge. And Don Armado shall be your keeper.
My lord Biron, see him delivered o’er,
And go we, lords, to put in practice that
Which each to other hath so strongly sworn. Exeunt the King, Longueville, and Dumaine I’ll lay my head to any good man’s hat
These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn.
Sirrah, come on.
