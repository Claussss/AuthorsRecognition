KING HENRY (to Fastolf) Stain to thy countrymen, thou hear’st thy doom.
Be packing, therefore, thou that wast a knight.
Henceforth we banish thee on pain of death. Exit Fastolf And now, my Lord Protector, view the letter
Sent from our uncle, Duke of Burgundy. What means his grace that he hath changed his
style?
No more but plain and bluntly ‘To the King’?
Hath he forgot he is his sovereign?
Or doth this churlish superscription
Pretend some alteration in good will?
What’s here? ‘I have upon especial cause,
Moved with compassion of my country’s wrack
Together with the pitiful complaints
Of such as your oppression feeds upon,
Forsaken your pernicious faction
And joined with Charles, the rightful King of France.’
O monstrous treachery! Can this be so?
That in alliance, amity, and oaths
There should be found such false dissembling guile?
