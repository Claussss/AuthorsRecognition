4.4
Enter Belarius, Guiderius, and Arviragus The noise is round about us. Let us from it. What pleasure, sir, find we in life to lock it
From action and adventure? Nay, what hope Have we in hiding us? This way the Romans
Must or for Britains slay us, or receive us
For barbarous and unnatural revolts
During their use, and slay us after.
