KING PHILIP So, by a roaring tempest on the flood,
A whole armada of convicted sail
Is scattered and disjoined from fellowship. Courage and comfort; all shall yet go well. KING PHILIP What can go well when we have run so ill?
Are we not beaten? Is not Angers lost,
Arthur ta‘en prisoner, divers dear friends slain,
And bloody England into England gone,
O’erbearing interruption, spite of France?
