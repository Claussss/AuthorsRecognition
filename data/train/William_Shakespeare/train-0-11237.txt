Sir, the event Is yet to name the winner. Fare you well. Leave not the worthy Lucius, good my lords,
Till he have crossed the Severn. Happiness. Exeunt Lucius and lords He goes hence frowning, but it honours us
That we have given him cause. â€™Tis all the better. Your valiant Britons have their wishes in it.
