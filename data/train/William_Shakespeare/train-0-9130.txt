And sing, and dance, and toy, and kiss.
Over woods, high rocks and mountains,
Over seas and misty fountains,
Over steeples, towers and turrets,
We fly by night ’mongst troops of spirits.
No ring of bells to our ears sounds,
No howls of wolves, no yelps of hounds.
No, not the noise of waters-breach
Or cannons’ throat our height can reach.
