Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,
And built so shelving that one cannot climb it
Without apparent hazard of his life. Why then, a ladder quaintly made of cords
To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks,
Would serve to scale another Heroâ€™s tower,
So bold Leander would adventure it. Now as thou art a gentleman of blood,
Advise me where I may have such a ladder.
