TIMON Let all my land be sold. ‘Tis all engaged, some forfeited and gone,
And what remains will hardly stop the mouth
Of present dues. The future comes apace.
What shall defend the interim, and at length
How goes our reck’ning? To Lacedaemon did my land extend. O my good lord, the world is but a word.
Were it all yours to give it in a breath,
How quickly were it gone.
