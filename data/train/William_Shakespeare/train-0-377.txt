SILVIA What sayst thou? I thank you, madam, that you tender her.
Poor gentlewoman, my master wrongs her much. Dost thou know her? Almost as well as I do know myself.
To think upon her woes I do protest
That I have wept a hundred several times. Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her? I think she doth; and thatâ€™s her cause of sorrow.
