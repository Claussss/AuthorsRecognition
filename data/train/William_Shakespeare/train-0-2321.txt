Love surfeits not; lust like a glutton dies.
Love is all truth, lust full of forged lies. ‘More I could tell, but more I dare not say;
The text is old, the orator too green.
Therefore in sadness now I will away;
My face is full of shame, my heart of teen. Mine ears that to your wanton talk attended
Do burn themselves for having so offended.’
