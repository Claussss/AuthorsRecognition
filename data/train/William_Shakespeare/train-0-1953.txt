FIRST MURDERER Ay, millstones, as he lessoned us to weep. O do not slander him, for he is kind. FIRST MURDERER As snow in harvest. Come, you deceive yourself.
â€˜Tis he that sends us to destroy you here. It cannot be, for he bewept my fortune,
And hugged me in his arms, and swore with sobs
That he would labour my delivery.
