ANTONIO (to Hero) Well, niece, I trust you will be ruled by your father. BEATRICE Yes, faith, it is my cousin’s duty to make curtsy and say, ‘Father, as it please you.’ But yet for all that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else make another curtsy and say, ‘Father, as it please me.’ LEONATO Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.
