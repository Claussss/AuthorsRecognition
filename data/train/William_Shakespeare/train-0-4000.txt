’Deceiving me’ is Thisbe’s cue. She is to enter now,
and I am to spy her through the wall. You shall see,
it will fall pat as I told you. Enter Flute as Thisbe  Yonder she comes. FLUTE (as Thisbe) O wall, full often hast thou heard my moans
For parting my fair Pyramus and me.
My cherry lips have often kissed thy stones,
Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.
