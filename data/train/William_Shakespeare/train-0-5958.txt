CASSIUS Yet I fear him; For in the engrafted love he bears to Caesarâ€” Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him.
If he love Caesar, all that he can do
Is to himself: take thought, and die for Caesar.
And that were much he should, for he is given
To sports, to wildness, and much company. There is no fear in him. Let him not die;
For he will live, and laugh at this hereafter.
