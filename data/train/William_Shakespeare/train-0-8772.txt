Our poesy is as a gum which oozes
From whence ‘tis nourished. The fire i’th’ flint
Shows not till it be struck; our gentle flame
Provokes itself, and like the current flies
Each bound it chafes. What have you there? A picture, sir. When comes your book forth? Upon the heels of my presentment, sir.
Let’s see your piece.
