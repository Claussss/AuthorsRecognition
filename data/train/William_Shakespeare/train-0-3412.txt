Comfort, my liege. Remember who you are. KING RICHARD I had forgot myself. Am I not King?
Awake, thou sluggard majesty, thou sleep’st!
Is not the King’s name forty thousand names?
Arm, arm, my name! A puny subject strikes
At thy great glory. Look not to the ground,
Ye favourites of a king: are we not high?
High be our thoughts. I know my uncle York
Hath power enough to serve our turn.
