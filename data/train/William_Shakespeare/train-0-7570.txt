There be, sir—there be, if’t shall please your worship— ‘There be’, varlet? What be there, tell me what there be?
Come off or on ‘there be’, what be there, knave? There be, sir, divers very cunning fellows
That while you stand and look them in the face
Will have your purse. Thou’rt an honest knave. Tell me, what are they, where they may be caught.
Ay, those are they I look for.
