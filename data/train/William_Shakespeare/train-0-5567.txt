FRIAR Pause awhile, And let my counsel sway you in this case.
Your daughter here the princes left for dead,
Let her a while be secretly kept in,
And publish it that she is dead indeed.
Maintain a mourning ostentation,
And on your familyâ€™s old monument
Hang mournful epitaphs, and do all rites
That appertain unto a burial.
