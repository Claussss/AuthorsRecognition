The knights dance  So this was well asked, ’twas so well performed.
Come, here’s a lady that wants breathing too.
(To Pericles) And I have heard, sir, that the knights of
Tyre
Are excellent in making ladies trip,
And that their measures are as excellent. In those that practise them they are, my lord.
