RICHARD OF GLOUCESTER Ay, by my faith, for a poor earl to give.
I’ll do thee service for so good a gift. ’Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother. KING EDWARD Why then, ’tis mine, if but by Warwick’s gift. Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight;
And, weakling, Warwick takes his gift again;
And Henry is my king, Warwick his subject.
