LAERTES Dread my lord, Your leave and favour to return to France,
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
To show my duty in your coronation,
Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
My thoughts and wishes bend again towards France
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon. KING CLAUDIUS Have you your fatherâ€™s leave? What says Polonius?
