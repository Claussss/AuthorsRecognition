You are too great to be by me gainsaid,
Your spirit is too true, your fears too certain. NORTHUMBERLAND Yet for all this, say not that Percy’s dead.
I see a strange confession in thine eye—
Thou shak‘st thy head, and hold’st it fear or sin
To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so.
The tongue offends not that reports his death;
And he doth sin that doth belie the dead,
Not he which says the dead is not alive.
Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news
Hath but a losing office, and his tongue
Sounds ever after as a sullen bell
Remembered knolling a departing friend.
