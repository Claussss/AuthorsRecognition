No, foolish Tribune, no; no son of mine,
Nor thou, nor these, confederates in the deed
That hath dishonoured all our family;
Unworthy brother and unworthy sons! But let us give him burial as becomes,
Give Mutius burial with our brethren. Traitors, away, he rests not in this tomb.
This monument five hundred years hath stood,
Which I have sumptuously re-edified.
Here none but soldiers and Romeâ€™s servitors
Repose in fame, none basely slain in brawls.
Bury him where you can; he comes not here.
