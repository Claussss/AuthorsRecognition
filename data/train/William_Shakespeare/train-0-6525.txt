Good my lord, How does your honour for this many a day? I humbly thank you, well, well, well. My lord, I have remembrances of yours
That I have longed long to redeliver.
I pray you now receive them. No, no, I never gave you aught. My honoured lord, you know right well you did,
And with them words of so sweet breath composed
As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,
Take these again; for to the noble mind
Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
There, my lord.
