NATHANIEL A rare talent! DULL If a talent be a claw, look how he claws him with a talent. HOLOFERNES This is a gift that I have, simple, simpteâ€”a foolish extravagant spirit, full of forms, figures, shapes, objects, ideas, apprehensions, motions, revolutions. These are begot in the ventricle of memory, nourished in the womb of pia mater, and delivered upon the mellowing of occasion. But the gift is good in those in whom it is acute, and I am thankful for it.
