You to his love must accord,
Or have a woman to your lord. (To Touchstone and Audrey) You and you are sure together
As the winter to foul weather.—
Whiles a wedlock hymn we sing,
Feed yourselves with questioning,
That reason wonder may diminish
How thus we met, and these things finish. Wedding is great Juno’s crown,
O bless
‘Tis Hymen peoples every town.
High wedlock then be honoured.
Honour, high honour and renown
To Hymen, god of every town.
