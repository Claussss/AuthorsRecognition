Deep sounds make lesser noise than shallow fords,
And sorrow ebbs, being blown with wind of words. Her letter now is sealed, and on it writ
‘At Ardea to my lord with more than haste’.
The post attends, and she delivers it,
Charging the sour-faced groom to hie as fast
As lagging fowls before the northern blast.
