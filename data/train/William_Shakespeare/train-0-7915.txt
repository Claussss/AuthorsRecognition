LUCIO (aside) Ay, well said. The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept.
Those many had not dared to do that evil
If the first that did th‘edict infringe
Had answered for his deed. Now ’tis awake,
Takes note of what is done, and, like a prophet,
Looks in a glass that shows what future evils,
Either raw, or by remissness new conceived
And so in progress to be hatched and born,
Are now to have no successive degrees,
But ere they live, to end.
