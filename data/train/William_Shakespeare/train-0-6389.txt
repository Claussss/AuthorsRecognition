Sir, by your patience. (To Jaques de Bois) If I heard you
rightly
The Duke hath put on a religious life
And thrown into neglect the pompous court. JAQUES DE BOIS He hath. To him will I. Out of these convertites
There is much matter to be heard and learned.
(To the Duke)
You to your former honour I bequeath;
Your patience and your virtue well deserves it.
(To Orlando)
You to a love that your true faith doth merit;
(To Oliver)
You to your land, and love, and great allies;
(To Silvius)
You to a long and well-deserved bed;
(To Touchstone)
And you to wrangling, for thy loving voyage
Is but for two months victualled.â€”So, to your
pleasures;
I am for other than for dancing measures.
