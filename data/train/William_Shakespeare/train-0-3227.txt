O, you have lived in desolation here,
Unseen, unvisited, much to our shame. Not so, my lord. It is not so, I swear.
We have had pastimes here, and pleasant game.
A mess of Russians left us but of late. How, madam? Russians? Ay, in truth, my lord. Trim gallants, full of courtship and of state. ROSALINE
Madam, speak true.â€”It is not so, my lord.
My lady, to the manner of the days,
In courtesy gives undeserving praise.
We four indeed confronted were with four
In Russian habit. Here they stayed an hour,
And talked apace, and in that hour, my lord,
They did not bless us with one happy word.
I dare not call them fools, but this I think:
When they are thirsty, fools would fain have drink.
