CORDELIA (aside) Then poor Cordelia— And yet not so, since I am sure my love’s
More ponderous than my tongue. LEAR (to Regan) To thee and thine hereditary ever
Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom,
No less in space, validity, and pleasure
Than that conferred on Goneril. (To Cordelia) Now our
joy,
Although our last and least, to whose young love
The vines of France and milk of Burgundy
Strive to be interessed: what can you say to draw
A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.
