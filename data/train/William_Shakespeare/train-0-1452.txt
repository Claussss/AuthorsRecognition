GLOUCESTER Thou art reverend Touching thy spiritual function, not thy life. Rome shall remedy this. (to Winchester) My lord, it were your duty to forbear. Ay, so the bishop be not overborne:

And know the office that belongs to such. Methinks his lordship should be humbler.
It fitteth not a prelate so to plead.
