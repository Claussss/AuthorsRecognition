MORE’S OTHER DAUGHTER See where my father comes, joyful and merry. As seamen, having passed a troubled storm,
Dance on the pleasant shore, so I—O, I could speak
Now like a poet! Now, afore God, I am passing light.
Wife, give me kind welcome. [He kisses her] Thou wast wont to blame My kissing when my beard was in the stubble;
But I have been trimmed of late: I have had
A smooth court shaving, in good faith, I have.
