But still before that flew
 The lightning of your valour. Stay a little,
Is not this piece too strait? No, no, ’tis well. I would have nothing hurt thee but my sword—
A bruise would be dishonour. Now I am perfect. Stand off, then. Take my sword; I hold it better. I thank ye. No, keep it—your life lies on it.
Here’s one—if it but hold, I ask no more
For all my hopes. My cause and honour guard me.
