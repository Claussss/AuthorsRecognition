With one that wants her wits? Exeunt tribunes VOLUMNIA Take my prayers with you. I would the gods had nothing else to do
But to confirm my curses. Could I meet ’em
But once a day, it would unclog my heart
Of what lies heavy to’t. You have told them home And, by my troth, you have cause. You’ll sup with me?
