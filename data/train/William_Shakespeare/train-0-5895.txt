Enter the four French lords: the Constable, Orl GEBON O diabello! CONSTABLE Mort de ma vie! O jour de honte, all is gone, all is lost. CONSTABLE We are enough yet living in the field To smother up the English,
If any order might be thought upon. A plague of order! Once more to the field!
And he that will not follow Bourbon now,
Let him go home, and with his cap in hand,
Like a base leno hold the chamber door,
Whilst by a slave no gentler than my dog
His fairest daughter is contaminated.
