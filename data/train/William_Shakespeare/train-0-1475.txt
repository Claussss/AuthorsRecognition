Foul fiend of France, and hag of all despite,
Encompassed with thy lustful paramours,
Becomes it thee to taunt his valiant age
And twit with cowardice a man half dead?
Damsel, I’ll have a bout with you again,
Or else let Talbot perish with this shame. Are ye so hot, sir?—Yet, Pucelle, hold thy peace.
If Talbot do but thunder, rain will follow.
