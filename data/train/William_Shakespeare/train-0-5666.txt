Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth
Do all expect that you should rouse yourself
As did the former lions of your blood. WESTMORLAND They know your grace hath cause; and means and
might,
So hath your highness. Never king of England
Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects,
Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England
And lie pavilioned in the fields of France.
