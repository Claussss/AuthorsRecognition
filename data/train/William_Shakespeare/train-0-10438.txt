VIRGILIA My lord and husband. These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome. The sorrow that delivers us thus changed
Makes you think so. Like a dull actor now I have forgot my part, and I am out
Even to a full disgrace. FRisingl Best of my flesh,
Forgive my tyranny, but do not say
For that ‘Forgive our Romans’.
