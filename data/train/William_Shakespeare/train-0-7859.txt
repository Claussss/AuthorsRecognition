With child, perhaps? Unhapp’ly even so. And the new deputy now for the Duke—
Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,
Or whether that the body public be
A horse whereon the governor doth ride,
Who, newly in the seat, that it may know
He can command, lets it straight feel the spur—
Whether the tyranny be in his place,
Or in his eminence that fills it up—
I stagger in. But this new governor
Awakes me all the enrolled penalties
Which have, like unscoured armour, hung by th’ wall
So long that fourteen zodiacs have gone round,
And none of them been worn; and, for a name,
Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
Freshly on me. ’Tis surely for a name.
