Arcite, thou art so brave an enemy
That no man but thy cousin’s fit to kill thee.
I am well and lusty—choose your arms. ARCITE Choose you, sir. Wilt thou exceed in all, or dost thou do it
To make me spare thee? If you think so, cousin,
 You are deceived, for as I am a soldier,
I will not spare you. That’s well said.
