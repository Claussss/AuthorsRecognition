We will greet the time. To both these sisters have I sworn my love,
Each jealous of the other as the stung
Are of the adder. Which of them shall I take?—
Both?—one?—or neither? Neither can be enjoyed
If both remain alive. To take the widow
Exasperates, makes mad, her sister Goneril,
And hardly shall I carry out my side,
Her husband being alive. Now then, we’ll use
His countenance for the battle, which being done,
Let her who would be rid of him devise
His speedy taking off. As for the mercy
Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia,
The battle done, and they within our power,
Shall never see his pardon; for my state
Stands on me to defend, not to debate.
