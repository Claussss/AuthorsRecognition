Great men are still musicians, else the world lies:
They learn low strains after the notes that rise.
Good sir, be still yourself, and but remember
How in this general court of short-lived pleasure
The world, creation is the ample food
That is digested in the maw of time.
If man himself be subject to such ruin,
How shall his garment then, or the loose points
That tie respect unto his awe-ful place,
Avoid destruction? Most honoured father-in-law,
The blood you have bequeathed these several hearts
To nourish your posterity stands firm;
And as with joy you led us first to rise,
So with like hearts we’ll lock preferment’s eyes.
