VIRGILIA No, good madam, pardon me, indeed I will not forth. VALERIA In truth, la, go with me, and I’ll tell you excellent news of your husband. VIRGILIA O, good madam, there can be none yet. VALERIA Verily, I do not jest with you: there came news from him last night. VIRGILIA Indeed, madam? VALERIA In earnest, it’s true. I heard a senator speak it. Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth, against whom Cominius the general is gone with one part of our Roman power. Your lord and Titus Lartius are set down before their city Corioles. They nothing doubt prevailing, and to make it brief wars. This is true, on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us.
