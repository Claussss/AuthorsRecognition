SECOND GENTLEMAN Good morrow to your lordship. CERIMON Gentlemen, Why do you stir so early? FIRST GENTLEMAN Sir, Our lodgings, standing bleak upon the sea,
Shook as the earth did quake.
The very principals did seem to rend
And all to topple. Pure surprise and fear
Made me to quit the house. SECOND GENTLEMAN
