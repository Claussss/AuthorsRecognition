TRINCULO Monster, come, put some lime upon your fingers, and away with the rest. I will have none on’t. We shall lose our time,
And all be turned to barnacles, or to apes
With foreheads villainous low. STEFANO Monster, lay to your fingers. Help to bear this away where my hogshead of wine is, or I’ll turn you out of my kingdom. Go to, carry this.
