Andromache, I am offended with you.
Upon the love you bear me, get you in. Exit Andromache This foolish, dreaming, superstitious girl
Makes all these bodements. CASSANDRA O farewell, dear Hector. Look how thou diest; look how thy eye turns pale;
Look how thy wounds do bleed at many vents.
Hark how Troy roars, how Hecuba cries out,
How poor Andromache shrills her dolours forth.
Behold: distraction, frenzy, and amazement
Like witless antics one another meet,
And all cry ‘Hector, Hector’s dead, O Hector!’
