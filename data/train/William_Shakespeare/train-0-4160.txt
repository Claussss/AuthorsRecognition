LOUIS THE DAUPHIN But what shall I gain by young Arthurâ€™s fall? You, in the right of Lady Blanche your wife,
May then make all the claim that Arthur did. LOUIS THE DAUPHIN And lose it, life and all, as Arthur did. How green you are, and fresh in this old world 145
John lays you plots; the times conspire with you;
For he that steeps his safety in true blood
Shall find but bloody safety and untrue.
This act, so vilely born, shall cool the hearts
Of all his people, and freeze up their zeal,
That none so small advantage shall step forth
To check his reign but they will cherish it;
No natural exhalation in the sky,
No scope of nature, no distempered day,
No common wind, no custom
But they will pluck away his natural cause,
And call them meteors, prodigies, and signs,
Abortives, presages, and tongues of heaven
Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John.
