KATHERINE (to Baptista) I pray you, sir, is it your will
To make a stale of me amongst these mates? ‘Mates’, maid? How mean you that? No mates for
you
Unless you were of gentler, milder mould. I’faith, sir, you shall never need to fear.
Iwis it is not half-way to her heart,
But if it were, doubt not her care should be
To comb your noddle with a three-legged stool,
And paint your face, and use you like a fool.
