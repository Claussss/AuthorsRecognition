True, boy. (To Kent) Come, bring us to this hovel. Exeunt Lear and Kent FOOL This is a brave night to cool a courtesan. I’ll speak a prophecy ere I go: When priests are more in word than matter;
 When brewers mar their malt with water;
 When nobles are their tailors’ tutors,
 No heretics burned, but wenches’ suitors,
 Then shall the realm of Albion
 Come to great confusion.
When every case in law is right;
 No squire in debt nor no poor knight;
 When slanders do not live in tongues,
 Nor cutpurses come not to throngs;
 When usurers tell their gold i‘th’ field,
 And bawds and whores do churches build,
 Then comes the time, who lives to see’t,
 That going shall be used with feet.
