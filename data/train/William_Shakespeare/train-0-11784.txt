The nobles speak among themselves He’s discontented. Maybe he hears the King Does whet his anger to him. Sharp enough, Lord, for thy justice. CARDINAL WOLSEY (aside) The late Queen’s gentlewoman? A knight’s daughter
To be her mistress’ mistress? The Queen’s queen?
This candle burns not clear; ‘tis I must snuff it,
Then out it goes. What though I know her virtuous
And well deserving? Yet I know her for
A spleeny Lutheran, and not wholesome to
Our cause, that she should lie i’th’ bosom of
Our hard-ruled King. Again, there is sprung up
An heretic, an arch-one, Cranmer, one
Hath crawled into the favour of the King
And is his oracle.
