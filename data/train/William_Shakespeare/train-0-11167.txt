CLOTEN I have assailed her with musics, but she vouchsafes no notice. The exile of her minion is too new.
She hath not yet forgot him. Some more time
Must wear the print of his remembrance out,
And then she’s yours. QUEEN (to Cloten) You are most bound to th’ King, Who lets go by no vantages that may
Prefer you to his daughter. Frame yourself
To orderly solicits, and be friended
With aptness of the season. Make denials
Increase your services; so seem as if
You were inspired to do those duties which
You tender to her; that you in all obey her,
Save when command to your dismission tends,
And therein you are senseless.
