Is’t not mad, lodging Here in the wild woods, cousin? Yes, for them
 That have wild consciences. How tastes your victuals?
 Your hunger needs no sauce, I see. Not much.
 But if it did, yours is too tart, sweet cousin.
What is this? ARCITE Venison. ’Tis a lusty meat—
 Give me more wine. Here, Arcite, to the wenches
We have known in our days. Drinking
steward’s daughter.
Do you remember her?
