Then thus it must be; this doth Joan devise:
By fair persuasions mixed with sugared words
We will entice the Duke of Burgundy
To leave the Talbot and to follow us. 20 Ay, marry, sweeting, if we could do that
France were no place for Henryâ€™s warriors,
Nor should that nation boast it so with us,
But be extirp
