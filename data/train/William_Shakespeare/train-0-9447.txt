Enter a Servant with Thidias Is he whipped? SERVANT Soundly, my lord. ANTONY Cried he, and begged a pardon? SERVANT He did ask favour. ANTONY (to Thidias) If that thy father live, let him repent
Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry
To follow Caesar in his triumph, since
Thou hast been whipped for following him. Henceforth
The white hand of a lady fever thee,
Shake thou to look on’t. Get thee back to Caesar;
Tell him thy entertainment. Look thou say
He makes me angry with him, for he seems
Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,
Not what he knew I was. He makes me angry,
And at this time most easy ’tis to do’t,
When my good stars that were my former guides
Have empty left their orbs, and shot their fires
Into th’abyss of hell. If he mislike
My speech and what is done, tell him he has
Hipparchus, my enfranch
He may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture,
As he shall like, to quit me. Urge it thou.
Hence, with thy stripes, be gone!
