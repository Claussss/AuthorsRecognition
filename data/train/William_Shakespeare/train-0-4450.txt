Is it so nominated in the bond? It is not so expressed, but what of that? ’Twere good you do so much for charity. I cannot find it. ’Tis not in the bond. PORTIA (to Antonio) You, merchant, have you anything to say? But little. I am armed and well prepared. Give me your hand, Bassanio; fare you well.
Grieve not that I am fall’n to this for you,
For herein Fortune shows herself more kind
Than is her custom; it is still her use
To let the wretched man outlive his wealth
To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
An age of poverty, from which ling’ring penance
Of such misery doth she cut me off.
Commend me to your honourable wife.
Tell her the process of Antonio’s end.
Say how I loved you. Speak me fair in death,
And when the tale is told, bid her be judge
Whether Bassanio had not once a love.
Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,
And he repents not that he pays your debt;
For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,
I’ll pay it instantly, with all my heart.
