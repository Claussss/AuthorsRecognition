TIMON A fool of thee! Depart. I love thee better now than e’er I did. I hate thee worse. APEMANTUS Why? TIMON Thou flatter’st misery. I flatter not, but say thou art a caitiff. Why dost thou seek me out? APEMANTUS To vex thee. Always a villain’s office, or a fool’s.
Dost please thyself in’t? APEMANTUS Ay.
