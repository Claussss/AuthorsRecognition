Be content, Again betake you to your hawthorn house.
With counsel of the night I will be here
With wholesome viands. These impediments
Will I file off. You shall have garments and
Perfumes to kill the smell o’th’ prison. After,
When you shall stretch yourself and say but ’Arcite,
I am in plight’, there shall be at your choice
Both sword and armour.
