CLIFFORD (Within) Warwick, stand still; and stir not till I come. Enter the Duke of York How now, my noble lord? What, all afoot? The deadly-handed Clifford slew my steed.
But match to match I have encountered him,
And made a prey for carrion kites and crows
Even of the bonny beast he loved so well.
