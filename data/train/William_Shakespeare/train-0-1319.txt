Enter on the walls King Henry the Sixth, reading a book, Richard Duke of Gloucester, and the Lieutenant of the Tower 
RICHARD OF GLOUCESTER Good day, my lord. What, at your book so hard? Ay, my good ford—‘my lord’, I should say, rather.
‘Tis sin to flatter; ‘good’ was little better.
‘Good Gloucester’ and ‘good devil’ were alike,
And both preposterous—therefore not ‘good lord’.
