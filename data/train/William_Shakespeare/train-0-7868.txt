Lucio calls within He calls again. I pray you answer him. She stands asidel Peace and prosperity! Who is’t that calls? She opens the door.
Enter Lucio Hail, virgin, if you be—as those cheek-roses
Proclaim you are no less. Can you so stead me
As bring me to the sight of Isabella,
A novice of this place, and the fair sister
To her unhappy brother Claudio?
