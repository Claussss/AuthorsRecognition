4.2
Enter Flavius, with two or three Servants 
FIRST SERVANT Hear you, master steward, where’s our master?
Are we undone, cast off, nothing remaining? Alack, my fellows, what should I say to you?
Let me be recorded: by the righteous gods,
I am as poor as you. FIRST SERVANT Such a house broke, So noble a master fall’n? All gone, and not
One friend to take his fortune by the arm
And go along with him?
