COUNTESS OF SALISBURY (kneeling before King Edward) In duty, lower than the ground I kneel,
And fore my dull knees bow my feeling heart,
To witness my obedience to your highness
With many millions of a subjectâ€™s thanks
For this your royal presence, whose approach
Hath driven war and danger from my gate.
