Good my liege, Your preparation can affront no less
Than what you hear of. Come more, for more you’re
ready.
The want is but to put those powers in motion
That long to move. I thank you. Let’s withdraw, And meet the time as it seeks us. We fear not
What can from Italy annoy us, but
We grieve at chances here. Away.
