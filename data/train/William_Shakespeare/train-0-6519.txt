ROSENCRANTZ Most like a gentleman. GUILDENSTERN But with much forcing of his disposition. ROSENCRANTZ Niggard of question, but of our demands
Most free in his reply. QUEEN GERTRUDE Did you assay him
To any pastime? ROSENCRANTZ Madam, it so fell out that certain players
We oâ€™er-raught on the way. Of these we told him,
And there did seem in him a kind of joy
To hear of it. They are about the court,
And, as I think, they have already order
This night to play before him.
