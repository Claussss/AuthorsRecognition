GIRL And so will I. DUCHESS OF YORK Peace, children, peace! The King doth love you well.
Incapable and shallow innocents,
You cannot guess who caused your fatherâ€™s death. Grannam, we can. For my good uncle Gloucester
Told me the King, provoked to it by the Queen,
Devised impeachments to imprison him,
And when my uncle told me so he wept,
And pitied me, and kindly kissed my cheek,
Bade me rely on him as on my father,
And he would love me dearly as his child.
